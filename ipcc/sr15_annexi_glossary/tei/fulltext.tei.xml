<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Business as usual (BAU) See Baseline scenario.</head><p>Carbon budget This term refers to three concepts in the literature: (1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, land-use change emissions, ocean and land CO 2 sinks, and the resulting atmospheric CO 2 growth rate. This is referred to as the global carbon budget; (2) the estimated cumulative amount of global carbon dioxide emissions that that is estimated to limit global surface temperature to a given level above a reference period, taking into account global surface temperature contributions of other GHGs and climate forcers; (3) the distribution of the carbon budget defined under (2) to the regional, national, or sub-national level based on considerations of equity, costs or efficiency. See also Remaining carbon budget.</p><p>Carbon cycle The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon in biomass, and carbon dissolved in the ocean as carbonate and bicarbonate) through the atmosphere, hydrosphere, terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere. In this report, the reference unit for the global carbon cycle is GtCO 2 or GtC (Gigatonne of carbon = 1 GtC = 10 15 grams of carbon. This corresponds to 3.667 GtCO 2 ).</p><p>Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) A naturally occurring gas, CO 2 is also a by-product of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning biomass, of land-use changes (LUC) and of industrial processes (e.g., cement production). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) that affects the Earth's radiative balance. It is the reference gas against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1. See also Greenhouse gas (GHG).</p><p>Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) A process in which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from industrial and energy-related sources is separated (captured), conditioned, compressed and transported to a storage location for long-term isolation from the atmosphere. Sometimes referred to as Carbon capture and storage. See also Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU), Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and Uptake.</p><p>Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU) A process in which CO 2 is captured and then used to produce a new product. If the CO 2 is stored in a product for a climate-relevant time horizon, this is referred to as carbon dioxide capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Only then, and only combined with CO 2 recently removed from the atmosphere, can CCUS lead to carbon dioxide removal. CCU is sometimes referred to as carbon dioxide capture and use. See also Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carbon dioxide capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) See</head><p>Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU).</p><p>Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) Anthropogenic activities removing CO 2 from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage, but excludes natural CO 2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. See also Mitigation (of climate change), Greenhouse gas removal (GGR), Negative emissions, Direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS) and Sink.</p><p>Carbon intensity The amount of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic product (GDP), output energy use or transport.</p><p>Carbon neutrality See Net zero CO 2 emissions.</p><p>Carbon price The price for avoided or released carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or CO 2 -equivalent emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax, or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies.</p><p>Carbon sequestration The process of storing carbon in a carbon pool. See also Blue carbon, Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), Uptake and Sink.</p><p>Carbon sink See Sink.</p><p>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) A mechanism defined under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol through which investors (governments or companies) from developed (Annex B) countries may finance greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction or removal projects in developing countries (Non-Annex B), and receive Certified Emission Reduction Units (CERs) for doing so. The CERs can be credited towards the commitments of the respective developed countries. The CDM is intended to facilitate the two objectives of promoting sustainable development (SD) in developing countries and of helping industrialised countries to reach their emissions commitments in a cost-effective way.</p><p>Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.</p><p>Climate change Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: 'a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.' The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes. See also Climate variability, Global warming, Ocean acidification (OA) and Detection and attribution.</p><p>Climate change commitment Climate change commitment is defined as the unavoidable future climate change resulting from inertia in the geophysical and socio-economic systems. Different types of climate change commitment are discussed in the literature (see subterms). Climate change commitment is usually quantified in terms of the further change in temperature, but it includes other future changes, for example in the hydrological cycle, in extreme weather events, in extreme climate events, and in sea level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constant composition commitment</head><p>The constant composition commitment is the remaining climate change that would result if atmospheric composition, and hence radiative forcing, were held fixed at a given value. It results from the thermal inertia of the ocean and slow processes in the cryosphere and land surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constant emissions commitment</head><p>The constant emissions commitment is the committed climate change that would result from keeping anthropogenic emissions constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zero emissions commitment</head><p>The zero emissions commitment is the climate change commitment that would result from setting anthropogenic emissions to zero. It is determined by both inertia in physical climate system components (ocean, cryosphere, land surface) and carbon cycle inertia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feasible scenario commitment</head><p>The feasible scenario commitment is the climate change that corresponds to the lowest emission scenario judged feasible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Infrastructure commitment</head><p>The infrastructure commitment is the climate change that would result if existing greenhouse gas and aerosol emitting infrastructure were used until the end of its expected lifetime.</p><p>Climate-compatible development (CCD) A form of development building on climate strategies that embrace development goals and development strategies that integrate climate risk management, adaptation and mitigation. This definition builds from <ref type="bibr" coords="7,257.51,269.37,44.95,10.61;7,56.69,280.37,52.27,10.61" target="#b24">Mitchell and Maxwell (2010)</ref>.</p><p>Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme weather events and extreme climate events are referred to collectively as 'climate extremes'. See also Extreme weather event.</p><p>Climate feedback An interaction in which a perturbation in one climate quantity causes a change in a second and the change in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in the first. A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in which the initial perturbation is enhanced. The initial perturbation can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability.</p><p>Climate governance See Governance.</p><p>Climate justice See Justice.</p><p>Climate model A numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. There is an evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry and biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and simulate the climate and for operational purposes, including monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions. See also Earth system model (ESM).</p><p>Climate neutrality Concept of a state in which human activities result in no net effect on the climate system. Achieving such a state would require balancing of residual emissions with emission (carbon dioxide) removal as well as accounting for regional or local biogeophysical effects of human activities that, for example, affect surface albedo or local climate. See also Net zero CO 2 emissions.</p><p>Climate projection A climate projection is the simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emission or concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is in turn based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socioeconomic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.</p><p>Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs) Trajectories that strengthen sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar adaptation to and resilience in a changing climate. They raise the ethics, equity and feasibility aspects of the deep societal transformation needed to drastically reduce emissions to limit global warming (e.g., to 1.5°C) and achieve desirable and liveable futures and well-being for all.</p><p>Climate-resilient pathways Iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and enhance opportunities associated with climate change. See also Development pathways (under Pathways), Transformation pathways (under Pathways), and Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs).</p><p>Climate sensitivity Climate sensitivity refers to the change in the annual global mean surface temperature in response to a change in the atmospheric CO 2 concentration or other radiative forcing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equilibrium climate sensitivity</head><p>Refers to the equilibrium (steady state) change in the annual global mean surface temperature following a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration. As a true equilibrium is challenging to define in climate models with dynamic oceans, the equilibrium climate sensitivity is often estimated through experiments in AOGCMs where CO 2 levels are either quadrupled or doubled from pre-industrial levels and which are integrated for 100-200 years. The climate sensitivity parameter (units: °C (W m -2 ) -1 ) refers to the equilibrium change in the annual global mean surface temperature following a unit change in radiative forcing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effective climate sensitivity</head><p>An estimate of the global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration that is evaluated from model output or observations for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a measure of the strengths of the climate feedbacks at a particular time and may vary with forcing history and climate state, and therefore may differ from equilibrium climate sensitivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transient climate response</head><p>The change in the global mean surface temperature, averaged over a 20-year period, centered at the time of atmospheric CO 2 doubling, in a climate model simulation in which CO 2 increases at 1% yr-1 from preindustrial. It is a measure of the strength of climate feedbacks and the timescale of ocean heat uptake.</p><p>Climate services Climate services refers to information and products that enhance users' knowledge and understanding about the impacts of climate change and/or climate variability so as to aid decision-making of individuals and organizations and enable preparedness and early climate change action. Products can include climate data products.</p><p>Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and ensure food security in a changing climate. CSA aims to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible (FAO, 2018).</p><p>Climate system The climate system is the highly complex system consisting of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and the biosphere and the interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition of the atmosphere and land-use change.</p><p>Climate target Climate target refers to a temperature limit, concentration level, or emissions reduction goal used towards the aim of avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For example, national climate targets may aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a certain amount over a given time horizon, for example those under the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>Climate variability Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability). See also Climate change. CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) emission The amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO 2 -equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon. For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the CO 2 -equivalent emissions of each gas. CO 2 -equivalent emission is a common scale for comparing emissions of different GHGs but does not imply equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses. There is generally no connection between CO 2 -equivalent emissions and resulting CO 2 -equivalent concentrations.</p><p>Co-benefits The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, thereby increasing the total benefits for society or the environment. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on local circumstances and implementation practices, among other factors. Co-benefits are also referred to as ancillary benefits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective</head><p>Capabilities (CBDR-RC) Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) is a key principle in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that recognises the different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual countries in tacking climate change. The principle of CBDR-RC is embedded in the 1992 UNFCCC treaty. The convention states: "… the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions." Since then the CBDR-RC principle has guided the UN climate negotiations.</p><p>Conference of the Parties (COP) The supreme body of UN conventions, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), comprising parties with a right to vote that have ratified or acceded to the convention. See also United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p>Confidence The robustness of a finding based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., mechanistic understanding, theory, data, models, expert judgment) and on the degree of agreement across multiple lines of evidence. In this report, confidence is expressed qualitatively ( <ref type="bibr" coords="8,358.37,49.35,86.32,10.61" target="#b20">Mastrandrea et al., 2010)</ref>.

See also Resilience.</p><p>Cost-benefit analysis Monetary assessment of all negative and positive impacts associated with a given action. Cost-benefit analysis enables comparison of different interventions, investments or strategies and reveals how a given investment or policy effort pays off for a particular person, company or country. Cost-benefit analyses representing society's point of view are important for climate change decision-making, but there are difficulties in aggregating costs and benefits across different actors and across timescales. See also Discounting.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness A measure of the cost at which policy goal or outcome is achieved. The lower the cost the greater the cost-effectiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) The Coupled</head><p>Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is a climate modelling activity from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) which coordinates and archives climate model simulations based on shared model inputs by modelling groups from around the world. The CMIP3 multimodel data set includes projections using SRES scenarios. The CMIP5 data set includes projections using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The CMIP6 phase involves a suite of common model experiments as well as an ensemble of CMIP-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs).</p><p>Cumulative emissions The total amount of emissions released over a specified period of time. See also Carbon budget, and Transient climate response to cumulative CO 2 emissions (TCRE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decarbonization</head><p>The process by which countries, individuals or other entities aim to achieve zero fossil carbon existence. Typically refers to a reduction of the carbon emissions associated with electricity, industry and transport.</p><p>Decoupling Decoupling (in relation to climate change) is where economic growth is no longer strongly associated with consumption of fossil fuels. Relative decoupling is where both grow but at different rates. Absolute decoupling is where economic growth happens but fossil fuels decline.</p><p>Deforestation Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry <ref type="bibr" coords="8,383.31,637.88,40.99,10.61">(IPCC, 2000)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demand-and supply-side measures</head><p>Demand-side measures Policies and programmes for influencing the demand for goods and/ or services. In the energy sector, demand-side management aims at reducing the demand for electricity and other forms of energy required to deliver energy services.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supply-side measures</head><p>Policies and programmes for influencing how a certain demand for goods and/or services is met. In the energy sector, for example, supplyside mitigation measures aim at reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions emitted per unit of energy produced.</p><p>See also Mitigation measures.</p><p>Demand-side measures See Demand-and supply-side measures.</p><p>Detection See Detection and attribution.</p><p>Detection and attribution Detection of change is defined as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example, &lt;10%. Attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with a formal assessment of confidence.</p><p>Development pathways See Pathways.</p><p>Direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS) Chemical process by which CO 2 is captured directly from the ambient air, with subsequent storage. Also known as direct air capture and storage (DACS).</p><p>Disaster Severe alterations in the normal functioning of a community or a society due to hazardous physical events interacting with vulnerable social conditions, leading to widespread adverse human, material, economic or environmental effects that require immediate emergency response to satisfy critical human needs and that may require external support for recovery. See also Hazard and Vulnerability.</p><p>Disaster risk management (DRM) Processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating strategies, policies, and measures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of increasing human security, well-being, quality of life, and sustainable development.</p><p>Discount rate See Discounting.</p><p>Discounting A mathematical operation that aims to make monetary (or other) amounts received or expended at different times (years) comparable across time. The discounter uses a fixed or possibly timevarying discount rate from year to year that makes future value worth less today (if the discount rate is positive). The choice of discount rate(s) is debated as it is a judgement based on hidden and/or explicit values.</p><p>(Internal) Displacement Internal displacement refers to the forced movement of people within the country they live in. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are 'Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.' <ref type="bibr" coords="9,143.14,703.85,35.28,10.61">(UN, 1998)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Downscaling</head><p>Downscaling is a method that derives local-to regional-scale (up to 100 km) information from larger-scale models or data analyses. Two main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution, or high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods are based on observations and develop statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/regional climate variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an important limitation on quality of the downscaled information. The two methods can be combined, e.g., applying empirical/statistical downscaling to the output of a regional climate model, consisting of a dynamical downscaling of a global climate model. Drought A period of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit must refer to the particular precipitation-related activity that is under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in general (due to soil moisture drought, also termed agricultural drought), and during the runoff and percolation season primarily affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by increases in actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as a meteorological drought. See also Soil moisture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Megadrought</head><p>A megadrought is a very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than normal, usually a decade or more.</p><p>Early warning systems (EWS) The set of technical, financial and institutional capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals, communities and organizations threatened by a hazard to prepare to act promptly and appropriately to reduce the possibility of harm or loss. Dependent upon context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/or Indigenous knowledge. EWS are also considered for ecological applications e.g., conservation, where the organization itself is not threatened by hazard but the ecosystem under conservation is (an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (for example, warnings of ground frost, hailstorms) and in fisheries (storm and tsunami warnings). This glossary entry builds from the definitions used in UNISDR (2009) and IPCC (2012a).</p><p>Earth system feedbacks See Climate feedback.</p><p>Earth system model (ESM) A coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model in which a representation of the carbon cycle is included, allowing for interactive calculation of atmospheric CO 2 or compatible emissions. Additional components (e.g., atmospheric chemistry, ice sheets, dynamic vegetation, nitrogen cycle, but also urban or crop models) may be included. See also Climate model. Ecosystem An ecosystem is a functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment and the interactions within and between them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems either contain people as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects of human activities in their environment. See also Ecosystem services.</p><p>Ecosystem services Ecological processes or functions having monetary or non-monetary value to individuals or society at large. These are frequently classified as (1) supporting services such as productivity or biodiversity maintenance, (2) provisioning services such as food or fibre, (3) regulating services such as climate regulation or carbon sequestration, and (4) cultural services such as tourism or spiritual and aesthetic appreciation.</p><p>Effective climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity.</p><p>Effective radiative forcing See Radiative forcing.</p><p>El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The term El Niño was initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Niña.</p><p>Electric vehicle (EV) A vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity.</p></div>

Concentration scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are often used as input to a climate model to compute climate projections. See also Baseline scenario, Mitigation scenario, Socio-economic scenario, Scenario, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (under Pathways), Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (under Pathways) and Transformation pathways (under Pathways).</p><p>Emission trajectories A projected development in time of the emission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or group of <ref type="bibr" coords="10,485.16,60.28,70.11,10.61;10,309.54,71.28,55.66,10.61">GHGs, aerosols, and GHG precursors.</ref> See also Emission pathways (under Pathways).</p><p>Emissions trading A market-based instrument aiming at meeting a mitigation objective in an efficient way. A cap on GHG emissions is divided in tradeable emission permits that are allocated by a combination of auctioning and handing out free allowances to entities within the jurisdiction of the trading scheme. Entities need to surrender emission permits equal to the amount of their emissions (e.g., tonnes of CO 2 ). An entity may sell excess permits to entities that can avoid the same amount of emissions in a cheaper way. Trading schemes may occur at the intra-company, domestic, or international level (e.g., the flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol and the EU-ETS) and may apply to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), other greenhouse gases (GHGs), or other substances.</p><p>Enabling conditions Conditions that affect the feasibility of adaptation and mitigation options, and can accelerate and scale-up systemic transitions that would limit temperature increase to 1.5°C and enhance capacities of systems and societies to adapt to the associated climate change, while achieving sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. Enabling conditions include finance, technological innovation, strengthening policy instruments, institutional capacity, multilevel governance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles. They also include inclusive processes, attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities for development and reconsideration of values. See also Feasibility.</p><p>Energy efficiency The ratio of output or useful energy or energy services or other useful physical outputs obtained from a system, conversion process, transmission or storage activity to the input of energy (measured as kWh kWh -1 , tonnes kWh -1 or any other physical measure of useful output like tonne-km transported). Energy efficiency is often described by energy intensity. In economics, energy intensity describes the ratio of economic output to energy input. Most commonly energy efficiency is measured as input energy over a physical or economic unit, i.e., kWh USD -1 (energy intensity), kWh tonne -1 . For buildings, it is often measured as kWh m -2 , and for vehicles as km liter -1 or liter km -1 . Very often in policy 'energy efficiency' is intended as the measures to reduce energy demand through technological options such as insulating buildings, more efficient appliances, efficient lighting, efficient vehicles, etc.</p><p>Energy security The goal of a given country, or the global community as a whole, to maintain an adequate, stable and predictable energy supply. Measures encompass safeguarding the sufficiency of energy resources to meet national energy demand at competitive and stable prices and the resilience of the energy supply; enabling development and deployment of technologies; building sufficient infrastructure to generate, store and transmit energy supplies; and ensuring enforceable contracts of delivery.</p><p>Enhanced weathering Enhancing the removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere through dissolution of silicate and carbonate rocks by grinding these minerals to small particles and actively applying them to soils, coasts or oceans.</p><p>(Model) Ensemble A group of parallel model simulations characterising historical climate conditions, climate predictions, or climate projections. Variation of the results across the ensemble members may give an estimate of modelling-based uncertainty. Ensembles made with the same model but different initial conditions only characterize the uncertainty associated with internal climate variability, whereas multimodel ensembles including simulations by several models also include the impact of model differences. Perturbed parameter ensembles, in which model parameters are varied in a systematic manner, aim to assess the uncertainty resulting from internal model specifications within a single model. Remaining sources of uncertainty unaddressed with model ensembles are related to systematic model errors or biases, which may be assessed from systematic comparisons of model simulations with observations wherever available.

Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (mostly OECD countries and countries with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 )) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the first commitment period <ref type="bibr" coords="15,241.06,302.41,19.26,10.61">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,260.32,302.41,3.85,10.61">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,260.32,302.41,3.85,10.61">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,260.32,302.41,3.85,10.61">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,264.17,302.41,19.26,10.61">(2012)</ref>.

The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which land is managed (e.g., grazing, timber extraction, conservation and city dwelling). In national greenhouse gas inventories, land use is classified according to the IPCC land use categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetland, settlements, other.

For example, if agricultural land is diverted to fuel production, forest clearance may occur elsewhere to replace the former agricultural production.</p><p>Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) In the context of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories under the UNFCCC, LULUCF is a GHG inventory sector that covers anthropogenic emissions and removals of GHG from carbon pools in managed lands, excluding non-CO 2 agricultural emissions. Following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, 'anthropogenic' land-related GHG fluxes are defined as all those occurring on 'managed land', i.e., 'where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions'. Since managed land may include CO 2 removals not considered as 'anthropogenic' in some of the scientific literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with CO 2 fertilization and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates included in this report are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories.</p><p>See also Afforestation, Deforestation, Reforestation, and the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry <ref type="bibr" coords="15,493.43,131.90,37.29,10.61">(IPCC, 2000</ref>).</p><p>Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) See Land-use change (LUC).</p><p>Life cycle assessment (LCA) Compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its life cycle.

This set of compounds includes carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), together with some fluorinated gases. They have a warming effect on climate. These compounds accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial time scales, and their effect on climate hence persists for decades to centuries after their emission. On time scales of decades to a century, already emitted emissions of long-lived climate forcers can only be abated by greenhouse gas removal (GGR).

A market distortion is any event in which a market reaches a market clearing price that is substantially different from the price that a market would achieve while operating under conditions of perfect competition and state enforcement of legal contracts and the ownership of private property. Examples of factors causing market prices to deviate from real economic scarcity are environmental externalities, public goods, monopoly power, information asymmetry, transaction costs and non-rational behaviour.</p></div>

The traditional radiative forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for.

REDD+ goes beyond deforestation and forest degradation, and includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. The concept was first introduced in 2005 in the 11th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Montreal and later given greater recognition in the 13th Session of the COP in 2007 at Bali and inclusion in the Bali Action Plan, which called for 'policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD) and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stock in developing countries.'

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk</head><p>The potential for adverse consequences where something of value is at stake and where the occurrence and degree of an outcome is uncertain. In the context of the assessment of climate impacts, the term risk is often used to refer to the potential for adverse consequences of a climate-related hazard, or of adaptation or mitigation responses to such a hazard, on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and infrastructure. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability (of the affected system), its exposure over time (to the hazard), as well as the (climate-related) hazard and the likelihood of its occurrence.</p><p>Risk assessment The qualitative and/or quantitative scientific estimation of risks. See also Risk, Risk management and Risk perception.</p><p>Risk management Plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or consequences of risks or to respond to consequences. See also Risk, Risk assessment and Risk perception.</p><p>Risk perception The subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk. See also Risk, Risk assessment and Risk management.</p><p>Runoff The flow of water over the surface or through the subsurface, which typically originates from the part of liquid precipitation and/or snow/ice melt that does not evaporate or refreeze, and is not transpired. See also Hydrological cycle.</p><p>Scenario A plausible description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships. Note that scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts, but are used to provide a view of the implications of developments and actions. See also Baseline scenario, Emission scenario, Mitigation scenario and Pathways.</p><p>Scenario storyline A narrative description of a scenario (or family of scenarios), highlighting the main scenario characteristics, relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics of their evolution. Also referred to as 'narratives' in the scenario literature. See also Narratives. SDG-interaction score A seven-point scale <ref type="bibr" coords="19,486.43,500.31,74.51,10.61" target="#b29">(Nilsson et al., 2016)</ref> used to rate interactions between mitigation options and the SDGs. Scores range from +3 (indivisible) to −3 (cancelling), with a zero score indicating 'consistent' but with neither a positive or negative interaction. The scale, as applied in this report, also includes direction (whether the interaction is uni-or bi-directional) and confidence as assessed per IPCC guidelines.</p><p>Sea ice Ice found at the sea surface that has originated from the freezing of seawater. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). Sea ice concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less than one year old is called firstyear ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multi-year ice has survived at least two summers.</p><p>Sea level change (sea level rise/sea level fall) Sea level can change, both globally and locally (relative sea level change) due to (1) a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in the mass of water in the ocean, (2) changes in ocean volume as a result of changes in ocean water density, (3) changes in the shape of the ocean basins and changes in the Earth's gravitational and rotational fields, and (4) local subsidence or uplift of the land. Global mean sea level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent (SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called thermosteric, while density changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and its distribution.</p><p>Sea surface temperature (SST) The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys, and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature (uppermost layer; a fraction of a millimeter thick) in the infrared or the top centimeter or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction The Sendai</head><p>Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 outlines seven clear targets and four priorities for action to prevent new, and to reduce existing, disaster risks. The voluntary, non-binding agreement recognizes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders, including local government and the private sector. Its aim is to achieve 'substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries.' Sequestration See Uptake.</p><p>Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) See Pathways.</p><p>Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) Short-lived climate forcers refers to a set of compounds that are primarily composed of those with short lifetimes in the atmosphere compared to well-mixed greenhouse gases, and are also referred to as near-term climate forcers. This set of compounds includes methane (CH 4 ), which is also a well-mixed greenhouse gas, as well as ozone (O 3 ) and aerosols, or their precursors, and some halogenated species that are not well-mixed greenhouse gases. These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to centennial time scales, and so their effect on climate is predominantly in the first decade after their emission, although their changes can still induce long-term climate effects such as sea level change. Their effect can be cooling or warming. A subset of exclusively warming short-lived climate forcers is referred to as short-lived climate pollutants. See also Long-lived climate forcers (LLCF).</p><p>Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP) See Short-lived climate forcers (SLCF).</p><p>Sink A reservoir (natural or human, in soil, ocean, and plants) where a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored. Note that UNFCCC Article 1.8 refers to a sink as any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. See also Uptake.</p><p>Small island developing states (SIDS) Small island developing states (SIDS), as recognised by the United Nations OHRLLS (Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States), are a distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities (UN-OHRLLS, 2011). They were recognized as a special case both for their environment and development at the Rio Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992. Fifty-eight countries and territories are presently classified as SIDS by the UN OHRLLS, with 38 being UN member states and 20 being Non-UN Members or Associate Members of the Regional Commissions ( <ref type="bibr" coords="20,405.71,93.36,60.41,10.61" target="#b47">UN-OHRLLS, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Social cost of carbon (SCC) The net present value of aggregate climate damages (with overall harmful damages expressed as a number with positive sign) from one more tonne of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), conditional on a global emissions trajectory over time.</p><p>Social costs The full costs of an action in terms of social welfare losses, including external costs associated with the impacts of this action on the environment, the economy (GDP, employment) and on the society as a whole.</p><p>Social-ecological systems An integrated system that includes human societies and ecosystems, in which humans are part of nature. The functions of such a system arise from the interactions and interdependence of the social and ecological subsystems. The system's structure is characterized by reciprocal feedbacks, emphasising that humans must be seen as a part of, not apart from, nature. This definition builds from Arctic Council (2016) and <ref type="bibr" coords="20,438.29,274.89,80.08,10.61" target="#b2">Berkes and Folke (1998)</ref>.</p><p>Social inclusion A process of improving the terms of participation in society, particularly for people who are disadvantaged, through enhancing opportunities, access to resources, and respect for rights <ref type="bibr" coords="20,541.95,313.38,13.34,10.61;20,309.54,324.38,40.77,10.61" target="#b41">(UN DESA, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Social justice See Justice.</p><p>Social learning A process of social interaction through which people learn new behaviours, capacities, values and attitudes.</p><p>Social value of mitigation activities (SVMA) Social, economic and environmental value of mitigation activities that include, in addition to their climate benefits, their co-benefits to adaptation and sustainable development objectives.</p><p>Societal (social) transformation See Transformation.</p><p>Socio-economic scenario A scenario that describes a possible future in terms of population, gross domestic product (GDP), and other socio-economic factors relevant to understanding the implications of climate change.

Rootzone soil moisture is of most relevance for plant activity.</p><p>Solar radiation management See Solar radiation modification (SRM).</p><p>Solar radiation modification (SRM) Solar radiation modification refers to the intentional modification of the Earth's shortwave radiative budget with the aim of reducing warming. Artificial injection of stratospheric aerosols, marine cloud brightening and land surface albedo modification are examples of proposed SRM methods. SRM does not fall within the definitions of mitigation and adaptation (IPCC, 2012b, p. 2). Note that in the literature SRM is also referred to as solar radiation management or albedo enhancement. Stabilization (of GHG or CO 2 -equivalent concentration) A state in which the atmospheric concentrations of one greenhouse gas (GHG) (e.g., carbon dioxide) or of a CO 2 -equivalent basket of GHGs (or a combination of GHGs and aerosols) remains constant over time.</p><p>Stranded assets Assets exposed to devaluations or conversion to 'liabilities' because of unanticipated changes in their initially expected revenues due to innovations and/or evolutions of the business context, including changes in public regulations at the domestic and international levels.</p><p>Stratosphere The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the troposphere extending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km at high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average) to about 50 km altitude. See also Atmosphere, and Troposphere.</p><p>Sub-national actor Sub-national actors include state/provincial, regional, metropolitan and local/municipal governments as well as nonparty stakeholders, such as civil society, the private sector, cities and other sub-national authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples.</p><p>Substantive rights See Human rights.</p><p>Supply-side measures See Demand-and supply-side measures.</p><p>Surface temperature See Global mean surface temperature (GMST), Land surface air temperature, Global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) and Sea surface temperature (SST).</p><p>Sustainability A dynamic process that guarantees the persistence of natural and human systems in an equitable manner.</p><p>Sustainable development (SD) Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs <ref type="bibr" coords="21,134.12,379.36,47.39,10.61" target="#b49">(WCED, 1987)</ref> and balances social, economic and environmental concerns. See also Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Development pathways (under Pathways).</p><p>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The 17 global goals for development for all countries established by the United Nations through a participatory process and elaborated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including ending poverty and hunger; ensuring health and well-being, education, gender equality, clean water and energy, and decent work; building and ensuring resilient and sustainable infrastructure, cities and consumption; reducing inequalities; protecting land and water ecosystems; promoting peace, justice and partnerships; and taking urgent action on climate change. See also Sustainable development (SD).</p><p>Technology transfer The exchange of knowledge, hardware and associated software, money and goods among stakeholders, which leads to the spread of technology for adaptation or mitigation. The term encompasses both diffusion of technologies and technological cooperation across and within countries.</p><p>Temperature overshoot The temporary exceedance of a specified level of global warming, such as 1.5°C. Overshoot implies a peak followed by a decline in global warming, achieved through anthropogenic removal of CO 2 exceeding remaining CO 2 emissions globally. See also Overshoot pathways and Non-overshoot pathways (both under Pathways).</p><p>Tipping point A level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the climate system, it refers to a critical threshold when global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state. See also Irreversibility.</p><p>Transformation A change in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems.</p><p>Societal (social) transformation A profound and often deliberate shift initiated by communities toward sustainability, facilitated by changes in individual and collective values and behaviours, and a fairer balance of political, cultural, and institutional power in society.</p><p>Transformation pathways See Pathways.</p><p>Transformational adaptation See Adaptation.</p><p>Transformative change A system-wide change that requires more than technological change through consideration of social and economic factors that, with technology, can bring about rapid change at scale.</p><p>Transient climate response See Climate sensitivity.</p><p>Transient climate response to cumulative CO 2 emissions (TCRE) The transient global average surface temperature change per unit cumulative CO 2 emissions, usually 1000 GtC. TCRE combines both information on the airborne fraction of cumulative CO 2 emissions (the fraction of the total CO 2 emitted that remains in the atmosphere, which is determined by carbon cycle processes) and on the transient climate response <ref type="bibr" coords="21,349.90,263.91,17.22,10.61">(TCR)</ref>.

Transition can be in individuals, firms, cities, regions and nations, and can be based on incremental or transformative change.</p><p>Tropical cyclone The general term for a strong, cyclonic-scale disturbance that originates over tropical oceans. Distinguished from weaker systems (often named tropical disturbances or depressions) by exceeding a threshold wind speed. A tropical storm is a tropical cyclone with one-minute average surface winds between 18 and 32 m s -1 . Beyond 32 m s -1 , a tropical cyclone is called a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, depending on geographic location. See also Extratropical cyclone.</p><p>Troposphere The lowest part of the atmosphere, from the surface to about 10 km in altitude at mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km at high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average), where clouds and weather phenomena occur. In the troposphere, temperatures generally decrease with height. See also Atmosphere and Stratosphere.</p><p>Uncertainty A state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, incomplete understanding of critical processes, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (e.g., a probability density function) or by qualitative statements (e.g., reflecting the judgment of a team of experts) (see <ref type="bibr" coords="21,542.95,621.38,18.00,10.61;21,315.20,632.38,73.50,10.61" target="#b25">Moss and Schneider, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,391.90,632.38,40.97,10.61">IPCC, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="21,436.07,632.38,88.69,10.61" target="#b20">Mastrandrea et al., 2010)</ref>.
