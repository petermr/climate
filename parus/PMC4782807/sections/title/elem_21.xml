    <sub>mean</sub> is the arithmetic mean of the threat score across the 19 experts who completed the survey correctly. Groups were defined according to (i) taxonomic order, which comprised Galliformes, Raptors (Accipitriformes), other non-passerines (Piciformes, Apodiformes and Cuculiformes) and Passerines; (ii) the predominant nesting habitat type used by the species in the Alps at the altitudes considered, comprising Forest (species associated with mature forest), General (generalist species occurring in a range of different habitats, often anthropogenic, and all other species which could not be classified on the basis of the former groups), Open (usually ground (or sometimes cliff)-nesting species occurring in Alpine grasslands) and Treeline (species commonly occurring in mosaic habitats around the treeline). Definitions were based on personal observations and experience, and also by the classifications used by the European Bird Census Council (

    <a rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-4">BirdLife International, 2004</a>), where 0 indicates the species is not listed as threatened, 2 indicates a species threatened in Europe, but not globally, and most of the global breeding population is within Europe, and 3 indicates a species which is threatened in Europe but not globally, and most of the global breeding population is outside of Europe (there were no SPEC1 species). Cites is the number of published articles within a mountain environment since 1970 for a given species following a standardised search in Web of Science™ . All species were recorded at least once in point counts surveys carried out in Piedmont in 2010 to 2012 (
