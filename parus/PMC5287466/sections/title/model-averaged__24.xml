 <div class="title">Model-averaged predicted overall occurrence probability of thrushes and finches depending on retained habitat variables.</div>
 <p>(A) 
  <span class="italic">Turdus</span> spp. (thrushes) with respect to distance to the nearest natural grassy area. Fringillidae (finches) in relation to (B) green and (C) brown vegetation covers. These habitat selection patterns at the field scale remained constant throughout the year. 95%-Bayesian credible intervals are drawn in grey. Circles represent raw data of the entire year. Occurrence probability was allowed to vary with the habitat variable under consideration, while other explanatory variables present in the average model were held constant at their mean values. Occurrence probabilities greater than 0.5 indicate selection or preference whereas values lower than 0.5 should be interpreted as avoidance, relative to the other available habitats [
