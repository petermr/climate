  <div class="title">Effect of leptin on body mass, feeding frequency and BMR in captive great tits.</div>
  <p>Within-individual changes in body mass (grams; measured between 10AM and 10.30AM; panel A), number of visits to the feeding during the first hour after feeding (panel B), and basal metabolic rate (kJ day
   <span class="sup">−1</span>; panel C) for leptin, placebo and non-treated captive female great tits. The grey window represents the 14 day period during which leptin was released from the implanted pellet in the leptin group (2 µg leptin day
