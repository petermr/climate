 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study compares - for the first time - the performance and temporal transferability of ecological niche models (ENMs) based upon climate, land-use/cover and ecosystem functional attributes (‘EFAs’), as well as the combinations of these factors. It is also, to our knowledge, the first study to evaluate the ability of an approach that hierarchically integrates climate with land-use/cover and ecosystem functional variables (cf.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integration of predictors and model transferability</div>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings showed that ENMs developed with the three sets of predictors (namely climate, land-use/cover and EFAs) were all useful for describing the distribution of our target species (cf. Figs 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">S3.1</a>). The integration of these ecologically relevant predictors significantly increased the model performance within the calibration time period, under both the hierarchical and non-hierarchical integration approach (see ‘crossvalidation’ in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). As expected, the enhanced model performance within the calibration time was also translated into an increase in model transferability (cf. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), providing additional support to the relevance of integrating climate and land-use/cover variables to improve our future biodiversity projections
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>
   </span> (‘H2’). In this sense, the integration of predictor variables related to ecosystem functioning − an often neglected dimension of ecological niche of species (but see
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
   </span>) − was found to increase model performance and transferability (cf. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), especially for migrant, forest specialist species (cf. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Nonetheless, the overall predictive accuracy beyond the calibration time period was considerably low, being acceptable for less than 25% of modelled species (‘H1’). The lack of model transferability might be due to the existence of non-analogous conditions and, consequently, the need to extrapolate
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
   </span>. Then, low transferability is almost a consequence of high uncertainty due to extrapolation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
   </span>. Indeed, a large spatial dissimilarity between years 2000 and 2010 was found for annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. Theoretically, more temporally stable variables could lead to higher model transferability, but it depends upon the species to be modelled and the relative importance of those variables in the model (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.1</a>). Also, land abandonment process and wildfires has been affecting landscape over the last decade (see Supplementary Figs 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.2</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM4">S4.3</a>), with strong impacts on the bird community, as has been already documented for our study area
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span>. In this sense, the explicit consideration of ecologically meaningful processes for species (i.e., fire disturbance) and more mechanistic approaches when modelling species distributions might have improved the temporal transferability of our ENMs, as has been illustrated for fire-prone systems
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" href="#CR84">84</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" href="#CR85">85</a>
   </span>. In addition, the development of more appropriate extrapolation methods can help generate more realistic predictions in different spaces or times, allowing higher model transferability and credibility

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretically, the hierarchical approach should have improved our predictions beyond the calibration time period, as regional climate models (i.e. those calibrated at Iberian scale and projected into the Gerês-Xurés conditions) should be able to capture a wider range of species distributions and, in turn, a wider range of climate conditions than local climate models (i.e. those calibrated at Gerês-Xurés level) (see spatial projections for Eurasian skylark, 
   <span class="italic">Alauda arvensis</span>, in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). Indeed, the high sensitivity of the downscaled climate projections derived from regional models (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) suggests that they were able to capture the broad climate envelope of the species, being refined with the subsequent integration of ENMs based upon land cover and ecosystem functioning variables at Gerês-Xurés scale (cf. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). These results contribute to the mounting evidence that hierarchical approaches effectively capture the intrinsic characteristics of ecological systems
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>, successfully integrating climate suitability over large scales with habitat characteristics at more local scales (see e.g.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" href="#CR87">87</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" href="#CR88">88</a>
   </span>). This multiscale hierarchical approach did not, however, show any advantages in terms of model transferability relative to the classic, non-hierarchical integrative approach (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), undermining its suitability for making predictions of bird distributions under global change scenarios, at least in our particular case (‘H3’). Here we applied the ‘direct approach’ to obtain fine-grained, downscaled climate suitability from models calibrated at broader scale
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>–
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" href="#CR64">64</a>
   </span>. This approach relies on the assumption ﻿that fine-grain species distributions show the same environmental associations as distributions at the coarse grain
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" href="#CR63">63</a>
   </span>, which might not be necessarily the case for all species. Alternative hierarchical approaches based on Bayesian modelling framework might help to overcome these limitations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" href="#CR89">89</a>
   </span>, eventually leading to more accurate predictions. Moreover, niche truncation is one of the most challenging issues when ENMs are used to predict in other times or spaces
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>
   </span>. For example, niche truncation can result from a limited range of environmental conditions existing in the study region used to calibrate models (i.e., realized environmental space 
   <span class="italic">sensu</span>
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" href="#CR91">91</a>
   </span>). In our study, models calibrated at local (Gerês-Xurés) and regional (Iberian Peninsula) scales have likely resulted in different niche truncation. Then, the challenge for predictive ecology is how to deal with predictions into non-analogous conditions (i.e., beyond the point of niche truncation), which can be an important constraint, even having chosen the most appropriate predictors. Recent research has also highlighted that the poor performance of uncorrected (random) cross-validation might be caused by dependence structures in the data that might also persist in model residuals, violating the assumption of independence. The large difference found between model accuracy within and beyond the calibration timeframe draws attention to the need for using independent validation data or, alternatively, block cross-validation methods if the goal is predicting to new data or predictor space
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" href="#CR92">92</a>
   </span>. Last but not least, the lack of repeated temporal sample structure in our bird data (both at local and regional scale), required for accounting statistically for biases related to imperfect detection, is an additional source of variation

  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings showed that species traits have a significant impact on both model performance and transferability (‘H4’; cf. Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>), despite the large variability among species (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM3">S3</a>). These results confirm the important role of species ecology on model performance, as previously suggested
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>,

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
   </span>. However, our results also suggest that the effects of species traits on predictive accuracy within the model calibration time period are not necessarily translated into its temporal transferability (cf. Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Thus, while biogeographic origin was found to affect model performance and transferability, habitat specialization and migratory status only impacted model performance (not transferability), and habitat preference did not impact either model performance or transferability (cf. Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Interestingly, the results also indicate a trait-predictor relationship as some specific traits seem to be linked to specific environmental predictors. For instance, model performance was higher for habitat specialists than for generalist species
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>
   </span> (see ‘crossvalidation’ in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Generalist species often have local subpopulations that differ in ecological characteristics, so modelling all these subpopulations together could overestimate the species ecological breadth and hence reduce model accuracy
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" href="#CR96">96</a>
   </span>. On the contrary, specialist species that inhabit in more restricted environmental conditions are usually more accurately predicted, as long as these conditions are not widely distributed
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" href="#CR95">95</a>
   </span>. Similarly, Mediterranean species showed higher predictive accuracy than Eurosiberian species, especially in ENMs that included climate variables (see ‘External TT’ in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>; ‘H4.1’), due also to a narrower niche and smaller range size in the study area
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>
   </span>. Hence, our ability to properly model species distributions hinges upon the niche breadth–range size relationship
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" href="#CR97">97</a>
   </span>, even though this does not necessarily have to affect model transferability (‘H4.2’; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). In fact, some studies found greater model transferability for wide-ranging organisms with broad environmental niches than for narrow-ranging specialists
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
   </span>. In addition, our results showed that migrant species were more accurately predicted than sedentary species (‘H4.3’; Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This is consistent with recent studies that demonstrated that migrating birds track vegetation dynamics
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>; i.e., the birds move with the seasonally progressing green-up of vegetation

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" href="#CR99">99</a>
   </span>. Food availability is one of the most important resources determining breeding success. On the basis of the well-established principle that resources availability is related to primary productivity
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" href="#CR100">100</a>
   </span>, several studies successfully correlated species distributions with the inter-annual variability and seasonal dynamics of vegetation, measured through satellite-derived indices
   <span class="sup">

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is particularly interesting to note that species traits affecting the performance and transferability of ENMs based upon climate and land cover variables also affected the predictive accuracy of ENMs based upon EFAs (H4.4, Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). This may be explained by the fact that EFAs can be directly affected by climate and land use/cover change
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span> and can thus potentially provide information about the integrative response of species to global environmental change
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" href="#CR102">102</a>
   </span>. Indeed, ENMs based exclusively upon EFAs showed higher niche overlap with the combined models – that integrate the three types of environmental predictors – than land cover or climate models (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). These results suggest that satellite-derived EFAs, in addition to assisting the on-going assessment of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) related to ecosystem functioning
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span> (see also Working Group Ecosystem function GEOBON,

Our results therefore confirm the ability of EFAs to accurately model bird distribution – especially for migrant, forest specialist species – although they cannot ensure model transferability by themselves (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Their integration with other ecologically relevant factors, such as climate and land use changes

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the study findings confirm the important role of species traits and environmental predictors in model performance and transferability for bird distributions, especially in highly dynamic systems. The progressive integration of ecologically relevant predictors related to climate, land-use/cover and ecosystem functional conditions significantly enhanced model performance within the calibration time period, under both hierarchical and non-hierarchical integration approaches. These findings provide additional support to the importance of integrating climate, land-use/cover and ecosystem functional variables to improve our future biodiversity projections. Unfortunately, the hierarchical multiscale approach did not show substantial advantages in terms of model transferability in comparison with the classic, non-hierarchical integrative approach, undermining its suitability for predicting bird distribution under global change scenarios. We strongly emphasize the importance of considering model transferability, in addition to traditional measures of model accuracy, and the need for caution when using ENMs to predict shifts in bird distributions as high discriminatory power within the calibration time frame does not guarantee the predictive ability of a model. Our findings also showed that species traits may significantly impact both model performance and transferability. In particular, the accuracy of prediction was highest for Mediterranean, migrant, habitat-specialist species, which provides guidance for the suitability of ENMs as an approach for predicting global change responses for birds in our region. However, the findings also suggest that the positive effects of species traits on predictive accuracy within model calibration are not necessarily translated into higher temporal transferability.</p>
