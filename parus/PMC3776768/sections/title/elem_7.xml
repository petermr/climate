  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three study sites differed in clutch size and breeding success for both species (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t001" href="#pone-0075536-t001">Table 1</a>). While clutch size was fairly consistent within sites, mean nestling body mass and mean brood biomass illustrate the scale of the differences in productivity between the three sites and over the 10 years under consideration (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g001" href="#pone-0075536-g001">Figure 1</a>). For both species, year-to-year variability was least at BW. For great tits, prior to 2012 both measures were also consistently highest at BW and were usually lowest at CUBG (and especially so in 2005). However, in 2012 both measures of nestling mass were relatively low compared to the previous nine years and for BW, significantly lower (ANOVA, p &lt;0.001 for both species). Although not quite so clear cut, blue tit mean mass and biomass were also relatively low in 2012 and especially so for CUBG. Although BW tended to produce heavier blue tit broods, biomass was significantly lower (ANOVA, p &lt;0.005) at this site in 2012 than in previous years and mean nestling mass was the second lowest recorded during the 10 years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general trend in the timing of breeding in relation to year-to-year variation in temperature followed the pattern documented previously [
   <a rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2">2</a>,
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
   <a rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21">21</a>], i.e. first eggs were laid earlier in warmer springs. However, there were significant differences between first egg dates at the three study sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g002" href="#pone-0075536-g002">Figure 2</a>). Over the 10 years of this study, great tits laid their first eggs significantly later at CL (ANCOVA p &lt;0.05) compared with the other two sites. For blue tits, egg laying started significantly earlier at BW (ANCOVA p &lt;0.05) compared with the other two sites. Overall, these trends are in keeping with the tendency of great tits to breed earlier in urban areas [
   <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>,
   <a rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22">22</a>], whereas blue tits usually start before great tits in woodland [

   <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. In 2012 both species started to breed earliest at BW, and this was on average the earliest start for blue tits during the entire 10 year study. However, over the period 1 March -25 April for which the spring warmth sum was calculated [
   <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">5</a>,
   <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>] 2012 was by no means warm - indeed it falls in the lower half of the index range (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the early first egg date for great tits at BW during 2012, they were the latest eggs to hatch (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g003" href="#pone-0075536-g003">Figure 3</a>). And although egg-laying by blue tits started earliest at BW in 2012 compared with CL and CUBG (~5 and 11 d respectively), average hatching was within ~4 days at all three sites. A comparison of the three sites (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g003" href="#pone-0075536-g003">Figure 3</a>) elucidates the components of this apparently extended breeding season at BW. On average, great tits laid their first eggs ~5 days earlier than in the previous 9 years for this site and thus the start of incubation and subsequent hatching could also have been early. However, the 2012 hatch dates at BW are 6 days later than the 9 year average and ~8 days later than they would have been if full incubation had begun as is typical on the day of clutch completion (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>). At CL, hatching was delayed a little, occurring ~3 days later than the 9 year average but within ~2 days of when they would have hatched with typical incubation (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>). At CUBG, hatching occurred at a date that suggested incubation had begun on the day of clutch completion which was 2 days earlier than the 9 year average and resulted in hatching that was ~12 days earlier than at BW. For great tits at BW in 2012, the period from first egg date to hatch day was ~32 days compared with 22 and 17 days at CL and CUBG respectively.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly for blue tits, egg-laying during 2012 was 4 days earlier than the 9 year average at BW and clutch completion was proportionally early compared with previous years (

However, despite the differential between first laying dates, on average, hatching occurred within 4 days at all 3 sites. As with great tits, although delays with incubation and hatching were minimal in the previous 9 years (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075536-t002" href="#pone-0075536-t002">Table 2</a>), during 2012 there was an average hatch delay of 2 days for blue tits at CL and CUBG but &gt;8 days at BW. Also noteworthy was that all blue tits at BW delayed their hatching by at least 7 days which did not occur at the other sites or for great tits and had not occurred in any of the previous 9 years.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At BW during 2012, egg laying was interrupted by 1-2 days in the case of 2 out of 7 blue tits and 1 out of 17 great tits but the majority of birds laid one egg per day until their clutch was completed and then left cold eggs in the nest to be incubated at a later date. This prolonged stalling of the nesting cycle was unprecedented during the 10 year period of this study at any of the three sites. Typically, full-time incubation usually started for both species within a day or two of clutch completion and hatching usually occurred ~14 d after the start of incubation.</p>

First egg date and hatch delay were significantly, negatively related to the number of young fledged for both species. Both variables were poor predictors of mean nestling weight in both species. Overall, the later the first egg date, and the longer the hatch delay, the lower the brood biomass and the number of young fledged.

The best models were obtained with 3 of the 9 possible predictor variables; models with the lowest Mallows Cp (M. Cp) values and standard error of regression (S) were selected.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For BW, there was more of a continuous relationship between hatch delay and temperature with 2012 representing extreme conditions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g005" href="#pone-0075536-g005">Figure 5</a>). The most acute challenge arguably was the result of rainfall; 2012 represented an extreme compared to preceding years due to the exceptional volumes of rain involved. The hatch delay was particularly prolonged for great tits at BW, and this is brought into focus if we consider the different stages of egg presence and development in the nest (laying, delay prior to incubation and incubation) against weather conditions prior to and during these stages (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075536-g006" href="#pone-0075536-g006">Figure 6</a>). During the last two weeks of March, although nighttime temperatures were below average, daytime temperatures were well above average and rainfall was below average. Egg-laying commenced during the first week of April and peaked during the third week by which time nighttime temperatures were below average, daytime temperatures had plummeted and rainfall was building towards a record high. There was a substantial delay before the females began full-time incubation which peaked at the beginning of May (day 31) by which time night temperatures were nearing average and rainfall was diminishing. However, daytime temperatures remained below average until the fourth week of May (day 52). Note also that as the last 20 or so eggs were hatching, temperatures dropped below average once more and rainfall increased considerably.
