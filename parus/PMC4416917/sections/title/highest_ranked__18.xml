 <div class="title">Highest ranked models (based on AIC
  <sub>C</sub>) of clutch size.
 </div>
 <p>Table of the highest ranked models in an AICC comparison of generalized linear mixed models explaining clutch size of adult female house sparrows on the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. The table shows the parameter estimates ± 1 standard error of the explanative variables included in the models. All models included maternal identity as a random factor. Data was collected on the island of Hestmannøy during the years 2007–2011. Morphological variables and age are from the mother of the clutch. Variable importance is given for each variable in parenthesis below the variable name (based on models with ∆ AIC
  <sub>C</sub> &lt; 2).
