  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small samples for molluscan analysis were taken at regular intervals throughout borehole CG1. Units 1, 2a, 4, 5 and 6 were barren but molluscan assemblages were recovered from sub-units 2c and 2d and Unit 3, whereas a few comminuted fragments were recovered from sub-unit 2b. The detritus muds (Unit 3) were easily the most shelly horizon. Consequently, the residues of large bulk samples from Unit 3 previously analysed for vertebrate remains by John Clayden (see 
   <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Holman et al., 1990</a>), were sorted and the frequencies of molluscan taxa estimated (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The assemblages from the silty clays (sub-units 2c–2d) are dominated by brackish species, including 
   <span class="italic">Hydrobia acuta</span> (=
   <span class="italic">Heleobia</span> cf. 
   <span class="italic">neglecta</span>), a hydrobiid previously listed as ‘
   <span class="italic">Paladilhia radigueli</span>’, and the cockle 
   <span class="italic">Cerastoderma glaucum</span>. Attribution of these hydrobiids to 
   <span class="italic">H. acuta</span> is tentative but they possess tall slender shells with deep sutures that match reference material. 
   <span class="italic">Peringia ulvae</span>, another hydrobiid tolerant of higher salinities, also occurs occasionally. This fauna is consistent with a quiet estuarine environment, which was sheltered from the influence of strong tidal activity. A brackish fluviatile setting appears more likely than a lagoonal or saltmarsh habitat, an interpretation that is further supported by the occasional presence of the freshwater gastropod 
   <span class="italic">Valvata piscinalis</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The faunas of the detritus muds (Unit 3) are more difficult to interpret because of the highly broken and probably allochthonous nature of the shells. Fourteen taxa have been recovered (
   <a rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>). The preservation is generally poor and many of the shells are corroded. 
   <span class="italic">H. acuta</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. glaucum</span> dominate the assemblage but freshwater species are also common, especially 
   <span class="italic">Bithynia tentaculata</span>, 
   <span class="italic">V. piscinalis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Ancylus fluviatilis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Corbicula fluminalis</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pisidium amnicum</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Pisidium casertanum</span> f. 
   <span class="italic">ponderosa</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Pisidium henslowanum</span>/
   <span class="italic">supinum</span>. Other species include 
   <span class="italic">Borysthenia naticina</span>, 
   <span class="italic">Radix balthica</span> (=
   <span class="italic">Lymnaea peregra</span>) and 
   <span class="italic">Pisidium clessini</span>. Fragments of freshwater mussel (
   <span class="italic">Anodonta</span> sp.) have also been recorded (
   <a rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib18">Bridgland et al., 1988</a>). No land snails were recovered. This fauna suggests an episode of inwashing from a nearby freshwater source, an event characterized by a marked change in depositional energies.
