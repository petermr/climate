The solid lines have been drawn from the best models retained including density-dependent effects of winter conditions, whereas dotted lines have been drawn from models including density-independent effects of winter conditions (tables S1 and S2). Dots correspond to observations between 1979 and 2013 and, as an illustration, have been split into cold winters (black dots) versus mild winters (cyan dots).
