 <div class="title">Relationship between begging intensity and parental feeding.</div>
 <p>The mean brood begging intensity of focal nestlings after 60 (grey) and 90 (black) minutes of food deprivation did not covary significantly with (A) the feeding rate of the focal parents ( =  the total number of dips given by the focal parents to their foster nestlings during a 2 h video session), but with (B) the mean growth rate of the foster nestlings ( = proxy of the intensity of parental feeding of the focal parents).</p>
