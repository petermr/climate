  <span class="bold">(A)</span> Geographical distribution of ITS ribotypes across sampled populations. Pie charts represent ribotype proportions. 
  <span class="bold">(B)</span> Statistical parsimony network of ITS ribotypes. Lines represent single nucleotide substitutions, and the small white dots indicate missing ribotypes (extinct or not found). The sizes of circles are approximately proportional to sample size (
  <span class="italic">n</span>), with the smallest circles representing 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 2 and the largest representing 
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 110. The map was drawn using ArcGIS v.9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA)
