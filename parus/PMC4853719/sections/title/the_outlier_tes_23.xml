 <div class="title">The outlier tests for 
  <span class="italic">E. henryi</span> using multi-methods based on 457 AFLP loci.

 <p>The outlier loci were detected by

  <span class="sc">mcheza</span>
  <span class="bold">(A)</span> and by 
  <span class="sc">bayescan</span>
  <span class="bold">(B)</span>, respectively, among the nine genetic clusters identified from the 
  <span class="sc">baps</span> analysis. Six outlier loci were identified by both methods together.
