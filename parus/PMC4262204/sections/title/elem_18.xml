 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the 10-year study (2000–2009) and 4012 individuals, the most appropriate models, selected by AIC, did not show any effect of SOI or SST on fledgling sex ratio. Indeed, the null model was retained regardless of the tested period (before breeding, summer after laying, and entire breeding cycle).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, it is interesting to note that the period of decreasing male proportion at fledging (2002–2007, except in 2006) coincided with negative values of SOI during the period of incubation and chick-brooding. Also, variability in fledging sex ratio tended to increase with SST (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114052-g003" href="#pone-0114052-g003">Fig. 3</a>), i.e. warmer years produced very unbalanced sex ratios (whether in favour of males or females) compared to colder years during which the sex ratio was close to 1∶1.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 2004 to 2009, the mean annual laying date of early breeders did not affect annual sex ratio at fledging (GLM; 
  <span class="italic">z</span> = −0.02, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.99). Similarly, the mean annual breeding success of the colony over the 10-year study (2000–2009) was not related to fledgling sex ratio (GLM;

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.28).
