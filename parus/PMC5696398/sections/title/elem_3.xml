  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nest box breeding great tit population of Wytham woods has been studied since 1960 using a standardized procedure (Perrins, 
   <a rid="ece33446-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0033">1965</a>; Perrins &amp; McCleery, 
   <a rid="ece33446-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0036">1989</a>). Nest boxes (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,203 with an average of 225 occupied by great tits each year) are visited weekly from early April. During these weekly checks, nest stage and number of eggs are recorded, and the date that a female initiated her clutch is then inferred by assuming a laying rate of one egg per day and counting back from the number of eggs observed on the weekly check. When at least three eggs are present, they are weighed so that species can be assigned (blue tits, coal tits (
   <span class="italic">Periparus ater</span>), and marsh tits (
   <span class="italic">Poecile palustris</span>) also use the Wytham nest boxes). Clutch size is defined as the maximum number of eggs observed in the nest. Date of hatching is established by visiting the nest on the estimated hatch date (date of clutch completion plus 11 days) and then every other day until the eggs hatch. If eggs have hatched prior to the hatch check, the largest chicks are weighed and assigned age based on their weight. Parents are identified at the nest either remotely using RFID (radio‐frequency identification) scanners (all previously trapped birds are fitted with RFID tags) or by catching using spring‐loaded nest box traps. All surviving nestlings are tagged with uniquely identifiable metal leg rings and RFID tags at 2 weeks of age. Nests are then checked postfledging to determine the number of chicks that left the nest.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In‐nest temperature data collection and incubation onset identification</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 2014 breeding season, in‐nest temperature was recorded at 163 great tit nests using iButton thermometers (DS1921G‐F5, accurate to ±1°C; HomeChip Ltd) set to record temperature every 20 min. These iButtons were secured in the nest cup by wrapping blunted garden wire around the iButton and using the protruding ends to anchor the iButton in the nest material. The iButtons and wire were then sealed into small cotton pouches. Pouch color was matched as closely as possible to the nesting material to minimize visibility to the female great tit (for further details, see Figure 
   <a rid="ece33446-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" href="#ece33446-fig-0001">1</a> in the supporting information, 
   <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S1</a>). iButtons were placed in every second great tit nest discovered across the woodland, throughout the season, ensuring a spatially and temporally even spread of sampling (163 of the 337 great tit nests). iButtons were placed in nests prior to the start of incubation (eggs were cold to the touch). Incubation in great tits occurs gradually (Haftorn, 
   <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>), and therefore, eggs can feel cold even after daytime incubation has begun if a fieldworker visits when the female is not incubating. Consequently, only nests which showed, from in‐nest temperatures, at least 1 day of nonincubation after placement of the iButton were included in our analyses. Four nests that did not meet this criteria were removed from the analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 163 iButtons placed, 109 were retrieved (54 disappeared from the nest and were assumed to have been removed by the resident great tit). There was potential for bias to be created if females who removed iButtons had a tendency for a certain incubation behavior. However, there was no statistical difference between the clutch completion to hatch period for those females who removed iButtons and those that did not (full analysis reported in supporting information 
   <a rid="ece33446-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#ece33446-sup-0001">S3</a>). Of the retrieved iButtons, a further six nests were removed from analyses because they were abandoned, three prior to incubation onset and three after incubation but prior to hatching. There was no significant association between abandonment and whether a nest had an iButton or not (χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> = 3.06, 
   <span class="italic">df</span> = 1, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = .08, 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 337). A further six iButtons were removed from analyses due to indistinct readings, probably due to deep burial in the nest by the resident female. We therefore present data from the remaining 93 nests where onset of daytime incubation was clearly identifiable.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Date of onset of daytime incubation was determined by combining in‐nest temperature measures with hourly local ambient temperature measures (see below for details of ambient temperature data collection) and calculating the difference between the two. Every in‐nest temperature was paired with a local ambient reading from the same hour. Each in‐nest iButton was matched to the closest ambient temperature iButton using GPS coordinates in ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), 
   <a rid="ece33446-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0011">2011</a>). In order to identify the onset of daytime incubation, it was necessary to distinguish when a female was incubating in the daytime. This posed a methodological challenge because the temperature readings from the iButtons did not represent the exact egg temperature due to different conductive properties of the egg and the iButton. iButtons were also prone to slight burial and movement within the nest cup based on female behavior, potentially altering the temperature readings. As a result, it was necessary to calibrate each iButton daily. The in‐nest iButton was calibrated to its daily position by selecting a period each day, when the female is known to be incubating (the period just after dark, c. 7 p.m., to midnight (Haftorn, 
   <a rid="ece33446-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece33446-bib-0017">1981</a>)), and using the temperatures recorded at this point as a threshold for what can be considered an incubating temperature. In‐nest temperature was calculated for this every night and temperatures over 4°C greater than ambient were taken to indicate incubation. This cutoff was chosen in order to avoid classing small deviations (1 or 2°C) caused by ambient temperature differences, as incubation. All in‐nest iButtons showed differences of &lt;1°C from local ambient temperature during the active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) prior to the onset of daytime incubation; therefore, we are confident a 4°C cutoff is sufficient to indicate incubation. The minimum of these incubating temperatures was then taken as the minimum incubation temperature for the focal nest and current iButton position. Recorded temperatures during the following active day (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.), which exceeded the defined threshold for a given nest and day, were classed as showing incubation is taking place. The onset of daytime incubation was consequently defined as the day when at least 50% of the active‐day recordings were classed as “incubating” (see Figure
