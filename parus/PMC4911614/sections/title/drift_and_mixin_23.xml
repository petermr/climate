  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a> are represented by orange dots; sampled colonies by coloured circles. (
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Estimated pairwise migration rates (outer coloured links) and 
  <span class="italic">Fst</span> (inner dashed links) between sampled colonies. Migrations as estimated from joint allele-frequency spectra. Colours refer to the receiving populations (DDU, Pointe Géologie near Dumont D'Urville station; HAL, Halley Bay; MZW, Mertz West; MZE, Mertz East; NEU, Neumayer; WSH, Cape Washington). Dashed circle: Antarctic polar circle (S66°33'). (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) Neighbour-net based on pairwise identity-by-state between all sampled individuals. Branch lengths represent pairwise Hamming distances. Colours correspond to colonies on map
