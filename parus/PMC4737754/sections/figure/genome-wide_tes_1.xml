   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Data 5a</a>) that were among the top 3% of gene-associated sweep targets (indicated by the dashed line). Chromosomes are separated by colour in ascending order according to their chromosome number. The Z chromosome is the furthest right. The solid lines in the upper two panels denote smoothing splines.
