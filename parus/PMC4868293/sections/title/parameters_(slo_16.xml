 <div class="title">Parameters (slope and R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) of the linear regression relationships between the warmth sum and the previous year, i-1, NAO WI (i.e. with time-lag) for 116 successive 23-year periods.
 </div>
 <p>Period 1 = 1878–1900; Period 116 = 1993–2015 (current study period). The relationships were significant (
  <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.05) in Periods 1 to 5, Periods 13, 14 and 16, Periods 91 to 97 and Periods 112 to 116. Slopes were both positive and negative, with negatives slopes becoming more frequent in the latter half of the dataset (since c. 1950).
