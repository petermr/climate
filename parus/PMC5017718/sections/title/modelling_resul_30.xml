 <p>Modelling results for local recruitment of the willow tit (
  <span class="italic">Poecile montanus</span>) survival examining the effects of available caterpillar biomass (BM1 = during ages 0–18; BM2 = during ages 8–13; BM3 = during ages 18–25). The models also include HD = the centred hatching date, DC = distance to the center of the study area, MASS = mass, DEN = density, + additive effects, *interaction and variable name2 = quadratic effect of the variable. QAIC is scaled with ĉ = 1.03. Model parameters for survival include also the intercept and age, and for recapture rates the intercept and time, but model names include only the covariates to increase readability.
