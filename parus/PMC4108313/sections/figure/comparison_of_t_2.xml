  <div class="title">Comparison of the three possible alternative demographic scenarios for the Upper Subansiri population.</div>
  <p>(A) Estimates of the posterior probability of each scenario and their comparison. Direct estimate: The number of times that a given scenario is found closest to the simulated datasets once the latter, produced under several scenarios, have been sorted by ascending distances to the observed dataset. Logistic regression: A polytomic weighted logistic regression was performed on the first closest datasets with the proportion contributed by each scenario as the dependent variable and the differences between the summary statistics of the observed and simulated datasets as the independent variables. The intercept of the regression, corresponding to an identity between simulated and observed summary statistics, was taken as the point estimate. In addition, 95% confidence intervals were computed

(B) Principal component analysis: Visual information on how data sets simulated under each scenario are close to the observed data set. Here too, Scenario 2 fits the observed data best
