 <div class="title">Polar plots of potential range centroid displacement.</div>
 <p>The distance and direction of each species' potential range centroid displacement (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001439-g001" href="#pone-0001439-g001">Figure 1</a>) is illustrated for the six potential future climate scenarios, each point in each plot representing an individual species. The radial distance from the centre of the plot at which a point is located indicates the geodesic distance (
  <span class="italic">D</span>) between the centroids of its simulated present and potential future ranges; the angular position of a point indicates the initial azimuth (
  <span class="italic">θ</span>) of the geodesic path between the present and potential future range centroids as a bearing relative to North (0°). The same logarithmic scale is used to plot radial distances in all six plots; the centre point of each plot represents a geodesic distance of 20 km, whilst their circumferences correspond to a distance of 3750 km.
