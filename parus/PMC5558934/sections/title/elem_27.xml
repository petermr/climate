 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Captive animals have been reported to be heavier (kg) than their wild counterparts [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref073">73</a>]. In the present study, animals in the wild population exhibited BCSs nearest to zero, while both captive populations differed more widely. Captive adults generally had more positive BCSs than those in the wild; however, sub-adults showed the opposite trend. In captivity, animals are usually allowed free access to perpetual food and water resources, and adults are housed in less crowded enclosures, separated from sub-adults. It is possible that interspecific competition and boldness/shyness of individuals among the sub-adults in more crowded enclosures account for the lower BCSs and consistent stress within that group (e.g., [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref030">30</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref074">74</a>]). In a study on great tits (
  <span class="italic">Parus major</span>), animals which exhibited shyness behaviors were also those same animals which exhibited higher basal CORT concentrations along with more extreme stress responses [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref075">75</a>]. A study on curve-billed thrashers (
  <span class="italic">Toxostoma curvirostre</span>) showed that animals exhibited an increase in basal CORT values when food-restricted in captivity [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref076">76</a>]. In the present study, an additional factor should be considered: sub-adults in the Madagascar captive population are generally fed native forage species; however, there are no studies on what sub-adults consume in the wild and how it may differ from adults and by season. In many chelonian species, sub-adults and adults not only inhabit differing habitats, but their diets are composed of different ratios or of entirely different species/items [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref077">77</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref081">81</a>]. Therefore, the BCS differences we see could involve factors for which we have not investigated here, and further research should be done.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though high CORT is often seen in wild-caught animals in captivity, captive-bred animals generally do better, exhibiting little to no chronic stress or attenuated stress responses [

In the wild, elevated CORT may be adaptive because it is associated with predator avoidance behaviors and cautious animal personality types in other species [

Although variability might still be harbored in the populations, captive sub-adults would not be exposed to such stressors and would be less likely to undergo such a response. These naiveties can be detrimental to survival [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref086" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref086">86</a>]. In a study on multiple parrot species, researchers found that most captive-bred birds, but only a small percentage of wild birds, were either recaptured or preyed on shortly after escape from enclosures [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elevated CORT is associated with predator avoidance behaviors and cautious animal personality types, and sub-adults in captivity generally do not exhibit a strong stress response or elevated basal CORT (as we found in the current study). In fact, individuals exhibiting aggressive behaviors or which are otherwise obviously stressed by captivity are generally bred out or avoided in captive breeding programs. This may be detrimental to individual survival because when the captive-bred animals are released into the wild they are unable to recognize threats and respond appropriately [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref001">1</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref087" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref087">87</a>]. As a supporting anecdote, we visited captive-bred 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">yniphora</span> that were repatriated to a previously depleted site within the natural range [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref088">88</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref089">89</a>]. When those animals are encountered in the wild, they readily approach humans, do not turn away or attempt to retreat when handled, and extend their limbs and neck if stroked or scratched (ATFC and ARM, pers. obs.). Though bold individuals may be avoided or bred out in captivity, the genetic variation they represent may be important for the long-term survival of a species which needs to adapt to changing habitats, threats, and climate. Variability provides the population an opportunity to remain reproductively viable amid stochastic events and face novel situations. Maintaining variability will also help avoid inbreeding depression in other ways, such as in preserving healthy immune system functions. Understanding and mediating stressors are therefore an important part of conservation management.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Captivity has been shown to elicit a chronic stress response in many wild-caught animal species [
  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref075">75</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0182004.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref092">92</a>]). Therefore, as might be expected, adult CORT concentrations were generally higher in captive populations than the wild, yet were not consistent. Only the captive males housed within the native country were higher, while the single male in the U.S. was lowest. The opposite trend was found in females, but were within range of the wild animals. The distinct values found in the U.S. population were probably due to specific circumstances associated with those individuals and are described by sex separately below.
 </p>
 <sec id="sec017" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Males</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The U.S. population’s adult male scored the highest positive BCSs, but males from both the Madagascar populations showed mean negative BCSs. Over time, both the Madagascar populations’ males exhibited similar BCS trends to one another, peaking mid-dry-season in July, which is likely associated with growth of testicular tissue (spermiogenesis and/or spermiation) as a surge in T occurs at that time. In many herpetofauna, reproductive timing in males is altogether or partially offset from mating season [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref093">93</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref094">94</a>], and this appears to be true in 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">yniphora</span> as well. Courtship and mating are seasonal in ploughshares, and generally occurs from October through December at the onset of the region’s wet season. Body condition scores dipped to the lowest values during the early wet season, when male-male competition for mates would be peaking. It has been suggested that males need to engage in combat in order to trigger their sexual interest in females [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref067">67</a>], and the combat itself will cause males to take in fewer food and water resources, altering BCSs. Males housed in the Madagascar captive population are regularly placed in shared enclosures, often specifically for these combat rituals, which may also help explain why they expressed BCSs and T concentrations more similar to wild individuals. Because the Madagascar captive population is generally fed native plant material, there may be a nutritional component to the similarity, as well as environmental, behavioral, and physiological components.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the wild population, males exhibit two CORT peaks which align with the time of ovulation in females, suggesting that competition for (and possibly defense of) mates is stressful for males. Monthly CORT in captive males was much more variable, and may be due to the changing of pairings and enclosures. However, we found that captive males which sired nests had overall higher basal CORT and T concentrations, suggesting that male-male competition is both stressful and requires aggression/dominance throughout the year. Similarly, in the eastern black rhinoceros (
   <span class="italic">Diceros bicornis michaeli</span>), dominant males exhibited significantly higher T and became sires by monopolizing more matings than non-sires [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref095">95</a>]. Although male sires in the current study had higher overall mean T, they exhibited significantly lower T during the months for which they sired. It logically follows that this strategy would be adaptive. For species which competition determines mating rights, aggressive males with higher T would generally be more successful in combat, but those T-linked aggressive behaviors could attenuate successful mating if directed at mates themselves. Dominant male 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">yniphora</span> may therefore undergo a reduction in T concentrations after combat to avoid misdirecting overly aggressive behaviors (e.g., causing harm or refusal by mates) and consequently, for courtship to take place.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nearly half of all the T samples collected from the U.S. captive male

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182004.g005" href="#pone.0182004.g005">Fig 5</a>). The U.S. male is not housed with other adult males and without the need to compete for access to females. His CORT concentrations remain low throughout the year while his T concentrations remain high throughout courtship, and aggression toward the females was noted. Although the females to which the U.S. male has access nested multiple times during this study, no fertilized eggs have been detected and sperm were not present in two eggs which were sacrificed to inspect them for the presence of sperm [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref096">96</a>]. This single example is concordant with the data presented above, suggesting that male 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">yniphora</span> may need to reduce T concentrations (through increasing CORT or otherwise) to successfully reproduce. Yet, there is still debate on what the variation in T signals with regard to an individual’s biology, and investigations into the relative importance and extrinsic influences that contribute to variation need be conducted to better interpret variation in T [

These peaks may be within days of each other, and our monthly sampling regime was not frequent enough to detect these changes in individuals. On the population-level, however, it is general practice to describe seasonal cycles as monthly trends in reproductive hormones, usually only over the months known for reproductive activity [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Female chelonians exhibit increased weights at the time when follicular development/vitellogenesis occurs. Concordantly, mean BCSs in adult females from all three populations were found to be positive, and changes in BCS over time appear to reflect nesting events. Both captive populations exhibited higher BCSs in adult females than the wild; however, monthly trends were less evident than in wild females. It has been shown that captive female 
   <span class="italic">A</span>.

   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref061">61</a>] which may be due to access to mates stimulating ovarian development [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref060">60</a>]. Therefore, the difference in captive females’ BCSs were probably not only due to restricted vagility alongside constant access to food and water resources, but probably also due to increased clutches per year. The idea that females may need to be paired with males for ovulation to occur suggests that: 1) this species may not have the capacity for sperm storage as is seen in many other chelonians and 2) the declining population density could directly affect reproductive output, exacerbating declines (as was seen in the passenger pigeon). For chelonian species where both vagility and density are low, the ability to store viable sperm from one season to the next is an incredible adaptation maintaining species survival. Unfortunately for the ploughshare, they may not have this ability yet, but it should be further investigated.

   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">yniphora</span> displayed synchronous upticks in CORT, E2, and P which were followed by decreases in BCSs. For the captive populations, these trends often lined up with observations of nesting. Generally, females exhibited two peaks in E2 and P. For wild females, E2 and P exhibited one smaller peak two months prior to a larger peak, suggesting that two clutches may be produced annually in the wild which is concordant with the study on nesting behavior by [

The two hormone peaks we note in females align with the two CORT peaks in wild males, and we also see the strongest uptick in female CORT along with those second peaks. Higher basal CORT concentrations have been associated with mating other species; both the male and female degu (

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that CORT was highest in females from the U.S. captive population, and consistently lowest in the Madagascar captive population. It is likely that these trends are directly related to their particular captive conditions. Females from the Madagascar captive population are separated from males in their group enclosures during all times except for matings. The two females in the U.S. population are relatively new imports to the facility and are offered little retreat from the males’ advances with which they are regularly housed. Those U.S. females’ E2 and P appear completely disrupted without clear peaks. Female reproductive cycles may become disrupted for a variety of reasons, and captivity may delay the onset on ovulation by months or years. Though some species have the capacity to attenuate reproduction in any given year, the underlying physiological regulation of this ability is not well understood [
   <a rid="pone.0182004.ref099" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0182004.ref099">99</a>]. It is probable that the females’ cycles are affected by the transfer into the northern hemisphere and are not yet acclimatized to the change. Though there are possible acclimation and persistent courtship stressors, the females are well fed and undergoing periods of follicular development [
