  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine of 37 fed and one of 43 control males had multiple broods. Two plausible models of probability of multiple brooding were identified: one including treatment and standardized hatching date and the other including the interaction of treatment and standardized hatching date (

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111180.s011" href="#pone.0111180.s011">Table S11</a> for the AICc model fits of all candidate models). Model averaged parameter estimates indicated that fed males were more likely to have multiple broods than were control males and that standardized hatching date had a significant inverse effect on the probability of multiple brooding (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0111180-t004" href="#pone-0111180-t004">Table 4</a>). The interaction of treatment and standardized hatching date was not well supported by the data, having confidence intervals that overlapped zero by a wide margin (
