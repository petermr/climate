 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Population size estimates of European bird species were obtained from websites and persons responsible for the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme in every European country. We obtained data for only 12 countries, either because in some countries this scheme has started very recently or has not started yet, or because information was unavailable upon request. Population indices from some countries or regions could not be used in this study owing to incomplete information (e.g. Wallonia), or because bird censuses were done only in one type of habitat (e.g. Latvia). Countries with available and suitable information on avian population size, the source of this information, number of bird species per country, mean number of years with data in every country (not all species were always surveyed the same number of years in a country), and last year with information on population size are shown in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimates of population size that we obtained were always standardized to a value of one in a particular year and the rest of the years indicated a value relative to the reference year. For example, if the population size estimate in a year was two for a particular species, it meant that the population size of that species was twice the value in the reference year. Therefore, these population size estimates are always relative values and are usually called population indices (for an example of the use of population indices, see [
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>]). These indices were calculated in the same way in all European countries following recommendations made by the European Bird Census Council (EBCC; see http://www.ebcc.info). Specifically, population indices were calculated using the software TRIM (Trends and Indices for Monitoring Data). More information about the programme TRIM can be found at the website http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/natuur-milieu/methoden/trim/default.htm. For most countries, the reference year was the first year of census, although that was not the case for Sweden, Germany and France, where the reference year was 1998, 1999 and 2001, respectively. In the case of Spain, the reference value was 0 instead of 1, and then population indices were transformed ((X+100)/100, where X was the population index), to make values comparable with those from other countries. For some countries (Czech Republic, Finland, France, and Poland) only graphs showing population indices, but not population indices themselves were available, and in these cases population indices were estimated from graphs using the program ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). In order to assess the accuracy of population indices calculated from the graphs, we estimated population indices from graphs in two countries, Spain and Sweden, for which both population indices and graphs were available. Twenty five species were randomly chosen per country, but only considering species with data for the maximum number of years available for the country, i.e., 11 years in Spain and 34 years in Sweden. Population indices estimated from the graphs or directly shown at the websites were highly repeatable ([
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>]; Spain: 
  <span class="italic">r</span> ≥ 0.998, 
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>10,11</sub> ≥ 842.00, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.00001 for 25 species; Sweden:

  <sub>33,34</sub> ≥ 326.32, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.00001 for 25 species).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study considered populations at the country level, a geographical scale considerably larger than the traditional ecological concept of a population, and thus we used countries as sample units. This should be appropriate for a continental-scale study, as was the case here, if two requirements are fulfilled. First, countries should be relatively small in relation to the breeding range of the birds, as happened to be the case here (mean (SE) country area = 0.263 x 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> (0.053 x 10

  <span class="sup">6</span> (0.331 x 10

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 73 bird species [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>], and unpublished data). Second, censuses must be representative of the whole country, covering different regions and habitats within the country in a balanced way. This is the procedure recommended by the EBCC and followed by most countries. Other studies investigating gradients at a continental scale and population indices also used countries and/or very large regions as sample units (e. g. [
