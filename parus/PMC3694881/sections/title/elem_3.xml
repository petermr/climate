  </div> entering the nestboxes to compete with, or depredate, dormice). Nestboxes were located at chest height, and were distributed along transects across the hazel coppice coupes of the wood, such that they were at least 20 m apart, in accordance with NDMP guidelines [
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">31</a>] (note that the number and location of the nestboxes remained the same over the 18 year period). Although the nestboxes were situated substantially lower than the potential height of natural nest-sites for logistical reasons (following NDMP guidelines), there is no evidence to suggest that this makes them less attractive to dormice than higher natural nest-sites (see 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">20</a>). Additionally, Sara et al. [
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">32</a>] found no significant difference between nestboxes placed at 1.5 m, 3 m and 5 m above ground. Nestbox monitoring was undertaken by volunteers for Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust (GWT), who manage the site. New volunteers were trained by long-term volunteers who accompanied them until they had enough experience to qualify for a dormouse handling license (a legal requirement in the UK [
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">33</a>]). Nestboxes measured 140x140 mm at the base, had a slanted roof with a mid-point height of 160 mm and a rear entrance hole of 30 mm in diameter, and were fixed to trees at chest height. Volunteer-collected data included presence or absence of nests and the number of individuals found in the nestbox during the survey. Volunteers did not search for natural nest-sites, since 1) this is not a requirement of the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme; and 2) there would have been considerable difficulty locating natural nests [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>,
  <a rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19">19</a>]. Summary data can be requested from the Gloucestershire Centre for Environmental Records (GCER). Dormouse occupation of nestboxes was relatively low, with an average of 7.3% of boxes occupied in any given year (S.D. = 3.3, minimum 2%, maximum 13%).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Volunteers removed nests and cleaned nestboxes at the end of winter each year unless the nestbox contained a dry, intact dormouse nest, as the volunteers hoped that this may encourage dormice to re-use the nestbox in the following year. Since dormouse nests were sometimes left over successive years, this variable could not be assured to be independent between years, and certainly not between monthly surveys. Furthermore, historic records showed that dormice were occasionally absent from nestboxes even when recently-made nests were found during a survey. As such, the presence of individuals in a nestbox at any point during the year was used as a dependent variable, since this removed the confounding results of nests being present between successive recordings, but also accounted for the lower likelihood of sightings of individuals compared to nests (this variable is termed dormouse occupancy).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The percentage of occupancy for each nestbox was calculated over the 18-year period (e.g. 9 years of occupancy = 50% occupancy). We hypothesised that leaving nests in nestboxes over successive years may have an influence on dormouse nestbox selection, alongside habitat variables surrounding the nestbox. To remove this effect, dormouse nestbox selection was also examined by treating dormouse nests as a binary variable (whereby nestboxes that had contained a nest at any time over the 18-year period were given a value of 1, and those which had never contained a nest were given a value of 0 – see below).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Local habitat variables were recorded in December 2009 when dormice were hibernating (note: these habitat variables were recorded by the lead author of this paper, RLW, not the volunteers, such that there was no scope for inter-observer variability). The number of trees and shrubs, and the plant species present, were recorded during a five-minute search within a 10 m radius of each nestbox to give an indication of the overall complexity and species diversity. Percentage ground cover was not calculated as cover varied greatly throughout the year. Data were collected during winter to better assess structural complexity related to tree branches. This provided a more meaningful value for this study than if foliage was dense, because dormice travel on branches, not leaves. Bird and small mammal nestbox data were obtained from the historic volunteer records (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="tab1" href="#tab1">Table 1)</a>. Bird and small mammal nests were always removed from one year to another (bird nests were removed soon after young had fledged from the nest), and individuals were rarely found in a nest during the surveys. Consequently, nests were thought to be a more reliable indicator of bird or small mammal presence in a given year, so this variable was used in all analyses, instead of occupancy (as described for dormice in the previous section).
