  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We fitted satellite transmitters (PTT-100 5 gram Solar PTT, Microwave Telemetry Inc.) on 13 fledgling common cuckoos during 2013–2014 at two Finnish breeding sites (

   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref014">14</a>]) and four young near Ruokolahti in 2013 (61°22'N 28°31'E; [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref015">15</a>]). The young cuckoos at both sites were raised in nest boxes allowing close monitoring of their growth rates. The host species were common redstart 
   <span class="italic">Phoenicurus phoenicurus</span> and in one case great tit 
   <span class="italic">Parus major</span>. The young cuckoos were tagged just before fledging and the harness size was the same as the one used in adults to account for further body growth [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref013">13</a>]).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 13 tagged nestlings, we consider 12 to have fledged successfully; for one, data was only received on the day of starting the transmitter indicating that fledging was not completed. Of the 12 successfully fledged juveniles, six transmitted positions for more than a month; four after 46 days and one the entire autumn migration, ceasing transmission after 12 days being stationary in the wintering grounds (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168940.g001" href="#pone.0168940.g001">Fig 1</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s004" href="#pone.0168940.s004">S2 Table</a>). Satellite data rarely allows distinguishing death from tag failure [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref016">16</a>]. For one tag, transmissions indicated death and this tag was later recovered on the dead bird. No other tags allowed distinguishing the cause of the stopped transmission, but death is likely to be the most common cause. For the successfully fledged juveniles (N = 12), five (42%) transmitted until assumed independent (i.e. &gt;20 km from nest). Of those reaching independence (N = 5), one (20%) transmitted until completion of autumn migration.

Assuming that all lost tags stopped transmitting because of death, our survival rates from fledging to independence were lower than those reported by Wyllie [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref019">19</a>], 42% versus 62%, but not significantly so (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s006" href="#pone.0168940.s006">S4 Table</a>). Survival of juveniles during the first migration (20%) was lower than those reported for adult satellite-tagged birds (down to 53% for UK birds travelling via the western route [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref016">16</a>]), though not significantly lower (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168940.s006" href="#pone.0168940.s006">S4 Table</a>) presumably due to the low sample sizes. Survival during the first migration is expected to be lower than during later migrations; in satellite-tracked Egyptian vultures

   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref020">20</a>]. In cuckoos, Wyllie [
   <a rid="pone.0168940.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0168940.ref019">19</a>] reported 4 out of 60 (7%) tagged fledglings returning to their breeding site in the following year but the degree of natal dispersal in cuckoos is not known.
