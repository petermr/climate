  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study aimed at finding the factors affecting the distribution of birds in different places in central Nepal and provides crucial background data for identifying important bird rich areas. In turn, it will indirectly help in formulating management plans and also in defining priority areas for bird conservation. Our study indicates that the Kathmandu valley is richer in birds than the Palung valley. At Phulchowki, however, we recorded one globally near-threatened and nationally critically endangered species, the Laggar Falcon (
   <span class="italic">Falco jugger</span>). There are also nationally endangered species at this site such as the Red-headed Trogon (
   <span class="italic">Harpactes erythrocephalus</span>), Blue-naped Pitta (
   <span class="italic">Pitta nipalensis</span>), White-throated Bulbul (
   <span class="italic">Alophoixus flaveolus</span>) and Purple Cochoa (
   <span class="italic">Cochoa purpurea</span>), as reported by Baral and Inskipp [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>]. The number of important species of birds recorded at Phulchowki well justifies its important bird area (IBA) status [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Nepalese endemic species, Spiny babbler (
   <span class="italic">Turdoides nipalensis</span>), was recorded at Chandragiri, as reported in a previous study [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref052">52</a>]. Although a road was constructed in this area, which resulted in a recent increase in number of visitors, Chandragiri still remains a very important habitat for birds due to presence of thick forest on its north facing slopes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Compared to the number of species of birds recorded for the whole of Nepal (877 bird species) [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref033">33</a>], the number of endangered species reported in this study is quite low because most of the endangered species of birds in Nepal occur at either low altitudes or in high altitudinal zones and this study focused on intermediate altitudinal zones [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref047">47</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref065">65</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref077">77</a>]. The low number of endangered birds could also partly be a result of our sampling technique, which was not intensive enough to record species that are very rare. In addition to this, as rare species are very elusive in nature, more effort is needed to spot them the field. Thus, the point count sampling technique used in this study is not appropriate for recording rare species [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref078">78</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Insectivore birds were the dominant and carnivores the rarest guild recorded in this study, which is similar to figures for the total bird species recorded in Nepal [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref040">40</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref077">77</a>] and other areas [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref079">79</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref080">80</a>]. Another reason for recording a very high proportion of insectivorous birds may be the exclusion of different soaring raptors and other high flying birds such as swallows (
   <span class="italic">Hirundo</span> spp.), martins (
   <span class="italic">Delichon</span> sp.) and crows (
   <span class="italic">Corvus</span> spp.) due to the difficulty of identifying the exact species. The family patterns of the birds recorded in this study is comparable to that for total bird species of Nepal [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of space</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The correlations of species richness and proportion of frugivorous and insectivorous species with geographic distances indicate that the distribution of suitable habitats is largely spatially autocorrelated and that neighbouring localities are more likely to have a similar species richness and feeding guilds. The fact that spatial effects for different feeding guilds were detected but not for species composition, may indicate that different species from the same guilds may replace each other in neighbouring localities and the exact species composition is determined more by local habitat conditions. We should, however, be cautious about accepting this conclusion as the number of birds recorded at each sampling point was relatively low and the high turnover in species composition may be also at least partly caused by low sampling effort. Significant effect of longitude and latitude, which were included as covariates in the subsequent tests supported the importance of space for these variables. These variables can in fact act as surrogates of climatic variables at larger spatial scales [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref081">81</a>]. In contrast to our results, the geographic variables (longitude and latitude) are regarded as important determinants not only of species richness [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref082" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref082">82</a>] but also of the occurrence of specific birds and thus of species composition in several previous studies (e.g. [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref083">83</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref084">84</a>]), which indicates that spatially autocorrelated edaphic and floristic differences are the main factors driving this pattern. These studies were, however, done in areas with a less variable topography and where large scale differences are likely to dominate over local habitat differentiation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species richness and composition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is previously reported that distributions of birds are determined by different environmental factors such as floristic composition, habitat structure, food availability, temperature and climate [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref085">85</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref088">88</a>]. The inverse relationship of species richness and altitude in two valleys (the Palung and Kathmandu valleys) in central Nepal is similar to the patterns recorded in previous studies on birds in the Himalayan region [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref009">9</a>,

   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref022">22</a>]. The sparseness of the vegetation at high altitudes due to the stressful climate and poor food resources are likely to be the main reason for low bird diversity [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref089">89</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref090">90</a>]. As indicated by the species-area relationship, the available area in hilly or mountain areas at high altitudes decreases compared to low altitudes because of mountain structures. So, when considering species-area relationships, more species are expected at low altitudes due to the presence there of large areas suitable for species [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref091" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref091">91</a>]. An alternative explanation for the decrease in species richness with increase in altitude could also be due to the distributional non-overlap [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref092">92</a>] associated with the radical change in habitats with altitude in different places.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altitude is strongly associated with not only species richness but also the distribution of the different feeding guilds and composition of bird communities, both in our study and also a range of previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref008">8</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref093">93</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref094" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref094">94</a>]. Specifically, the proportion of frugivorous and insectivorous birds decreased with increasing altitude in our study while proportion of omnivorous birds was not associated with altitude. Thus, insectivorous birds are more associated with places at low altitudes where the vegetation is dense. The number of nectarivorous and herbivorous species recorded in this study, however, was low and not tested statistically. These patterns are comparable to those recorded in other areas, such as in [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref093" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref093">93</a>], and on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref008">8</a>] and [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref095" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref095">95</a>]. The association of frugivorous birds in lower altitudes compared to higher is also due to the presence of more trees with fleshy fruits which provide them abundant food resources [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref096" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref096">96</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study also revealed that bird richness was higher on steeper slopes and in more heterogeneous habitats. The high species richness recorded on steep slopes could be linked to the fact that communities on steep slopes are better conserved compared to those in flat areas as people cannot easily access them for agriculture or settlement or fetching forest resources such as firewood, fruits, etc. The positive effect of heterogeneity on species richness of birds is in line with that reported in several previous studies [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref097" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref097">97</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref100" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref100">100</a>]. It can be explained in terms of the 'habitat heterogeneity hypothesis', which suggests that heterogeneous habitats provide more niches and diverse ways of exploiting the environmental resources (see Tews et al. for review) [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref101" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref101">101</a>] and thus increasing species diversity [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref085">85</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref102" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref102">102</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref103" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref103">103</a>]. This is also in accordance with predictions of the species richness-energy hypothesis [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref104" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref104">104</a>]. A similar effect was recorded for omnivorous birds but not for any other feeding guild. This is probably because omnivorous birds are able to utilize a wide range of resources and are efficient at utilizing environments with diverse food sources. The absence of any effect on the other feeding guilds can be explained by the fact that specific feeding guilds are confined to their own habitat and habitat heterogeneity may in fact lower the availability of each specific resource. While previous studies demonstrate that other habitat characteristics, such as forest fragmentation and agricultural activity, affect the richness of different feeding guilds [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref105" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref105">105</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref106" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref106">106</a>] no such effects were recorded in this study. This is likely to be due to the fact that a major portion of the variation in the different feeding guilds is associated with altitude and space, which prevents other effects being significant.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species richness, feeding guilds and species composition of bird communities differed in the two valleys. In contrast to feeding guilds and partly also to species richness, species composition was strongly associated with environmental variables such as percentage canopy cover, presence of forest edge, slope and shrubs. The major reason for this is the association of specific types of birds with particular types of habitats due to the availability of shelter and food. Of these variables, forest edges seem to be the most important as they provide specific habitats for some species of birds while other species are associated with resources found within highly productive woodlands and tend to avoid forest edges [
   <a rid="pone.0150498.ref107" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0150498.ref107">107</a>]. Species such as Golden-throated Barbet (
   <span class="italic">Megalaima franklinii</span>), Oriental Cuckoo (
   <span class="italic">Cuculus saturatus</span>), Wedge-tailed Green Pigeon (
   <span class="italic">Treron sphenura</span>), Crested Serpent Eagle (
   <span class="italic">Spilornis cheela</span>), etc. are restricted to the forests in these mountains. Thus, the habitat specificity and feeding habits of some birds are the major reasons for the association of bird communities in central Nepal with different environmental variables. Interestingly, factors strongly associated with species composition are not associated with species richness, indicating that habitat characteristics associated with occurrence of specific species are not associated with the number of niches available.
