  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, the three most strongly correlated landscape metrics of the farmland guild are Simpson’s diversity index (SIDI), the shape index distribution (SHAPE_MN) and the edge density (ED). All three act in the opposite direction of the LOP and are statistically significant at the 1% error level, that is, the higher the value of the metrics, the lower the occurrence of farmland birds. Greater 
   <span class="italic">diversity</span>, greater 
   <span class="italic">shape mean</span> and greater

With the exception of the grassland bird guild, all selected landscape metrics were significantly correlated with the particular guild LOP.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For four of the five considered guilds, it was possible to distinguish between less preferred and preferred habitats with success rates better than 80%. Only in the case of the grassland guild was the rate of correct classifications (66%) apparently poorer. Because an identical number of cases was used for all five guilds, it was possible to use the Nagelkerke 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> value in a comparative test of the classifications. It was not possible to derive the overall statistical significance of the classification, but it was possible to use the Nagelkerke 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> value to interpret the reliability of the classification. In this respect, it was obviously easier to classify the preferred and less preferred habitats for species of the forest and settlement guilds than for species of the grassland and hedgerow guilds. The rate of correct classifications and the considerably lower Nagelkerke 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> value for the grassland guild indicate that the classification of grassland habitats seems to be the most difficult.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
   <a rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" href="#Tab7">7</a> summarizes the detailed results for the farmland guild. In addition to the used input variables and the estimated unstandardized regression coefficients, the table shows the standardized regression coefficients and the 
   <span class="italic">p</span> value of the Wald statistic. The latter two provide information concerning the relative importance of individual input variables (i.e. habitat suitability expressed by landscape metrics) and their statistical significance. The input variable acts independently of the input variables. In the estimated logistic regression function for the farmland guild, all three unstandardized regression coefficients were statistically significant at the 5% error level. The standardized regression coefficient for Simpson’s diversity index (SIDI) indicates that this landscape metric had the greatest relative importance. In the case of identical relative changes among the three inputs, changes in the SIDI would have the greatest effect.
