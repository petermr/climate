  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to our main analyses, we explored the ecological relevance of our rainfall measures. To do this, we fitted models predicting invertebrate prey abundance and species diversity in each monthly pitfall trap transect. In these models, we included the following fixed effects: the total rainfall in the past 30 days to test for shorter‐term rainfall effects, the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in the past 12 months to test for longer‐term rainfall effects and the quadratic terms of this mean and standard deviation to test for any nonlinear effects. We included collection month as a random intercept. The abundance data were overdispersed but not zero‐inflated so we also included an observation‐level random effect in the abundance model and fitted it using a Poisson log‐normal error structure and log link function (Harrison, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0031">2014</a>). The diversity model was fitted using a normal error structure and its residuals checked to ensure they were normally distributed with a homogeneous variance.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of early‐life ecological conditions on banded mongooses</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mirroring our research questions, we conducted our analyses of the effect of early‐life ecological conditions in two stages: (1) effects during early‐life and (2) lifetime fitness effects, fitting our models to males and females separately. Banded mongooses are fully grown and reach sexual maturity between the ages of 1 and 2 years (zone ii in Figure 
   <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>; Cant et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>). Therefore, in stage 2 of our analyses, we only included individuals who had survived to 2 years old to ensure we only included fully developed individuals (zone iii in Figure 
   <a rid="ece32747-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece32747-fig-0002">2</a>). Table 
   <a rid="ece32747-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32747-tbl-0001">1</a> lists the models we fitted in each stage and details how the response variable in each model was measured, the sample sizes used, the random effects included and the models’ error structure and link functions. In all models, we fitted the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in an individual's first year of life as fixed effects. To test for the possibility of a life‐history trade‐off between survival and reproduction, our models of lifespan also included whether an individual had successfully reproduced in their lifetime (0/1) and the interaction between this and the first‐year rainfall variables. Our model of adult mass also included an individual's age as a control variable, while our model predicting the amount of social care received as a pup also included the ratio of adults (potential escorts) to pups in the group as a control variable. Banded mongoose reproduction is synchronized within groups, but not between groups, and in our equatorial study population reproduction occurs all year round. Consequently, population‐wide cohort effects, which can lead to spurious findings in the analysis of life‐history traits (Grosbois et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0029">2008</a>; Murray, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0053">2006</a>), are not expected in this system. Within‐group reproductive synchrony does form cohorts of individuals born in the same communal litter who all experience the same early‐life ecological conditions, and we controlled for this in stage 1 of our analysis by including breeding attempt as a random effect in our models (Table 
   <a rid="ece32747-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#ece32747-tbl-0001">1</a>). It was not necessary to control for within‐group cohort effects in stage 2 of our analyses because the high mortality rate in our population (e.g., 57% mortality between 1 and 3 months old, Hodge et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0036">2009</a>; see full survival curve in Cant et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0012">2016</a>) meant that individuals included in these analyses were almost entirely from unique breeding attempts.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conducted our analyses using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs). The residuals of models fitted using normal error structures (mass at 1 year old and adult mass) were checked to ensure they were normally distributed with constant variance. Models fitted to count data used a Poisson error structure unless they were overdispersed. Where this occurred, following Harrison (
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0031">2014</a>), models were fitted using a Poisson log‐normal error structure and an observation‐level random effect (lifespan models) unless the data were zero‐inflated in which case a negative binomial error structure was used (lifetime reproductive success models). We used the same model selection procedure as our complementary study of the effect of ecological conditions during adulthood on banded mongooses (Marshall et al., 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0047">2016</a>). We used likelihood ratio tests, comparing the full model to a model without a particular variable, to test the significance of this variable's effect (Forstmeier &amp; Schielzeth, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0020">2011</a>). Where interactions did not have a significant effect, we dropped these from our final model to allow us to test the significance of the main effects in these nonsignificant interactions (Engqvist, 
   <a rid="ece32747-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece32747-bib-0018">2005</a>). We did not reduce our model further due to the issues with stepwise model reduction techniques (Forstmeier &amp; Schielzeth,

Correlations between variables fitted in models as fixed effects — including the correlation between the mean and standard deviation of the monthly rainfall in a mongoose's first year — were lower than the levels previously shown to cause model fitting issues such as variance inflation in effect estimates (max
