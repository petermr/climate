 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distribution of reproductive output tended to be skewed to larger broods occurring earlier (negative values of SD
  <sub>HD</sub>)/later (positive values of SD
  <sub>HD</sub>) in the season when the spring progress was faster/slower at hatching times (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043944-g003" href="#pone-0043944-g003">Fig. 3a</a>), when the the nesting mortality increased/decreased during the season (

   <div class="title">Effects of selected covariates on the seasonal distribution of reproductive output of the red-backed shrike.</div>
   <p>Modelled by GAMM was the effect of mean cumulated total of degree days at hatching date with temperature threshold 0°C (CDD
    <sub>HD</sub>), standardized seasonal linear trend in daily mortality rate (trendDMR), and ln-transformed breeding density [ln(density)] across four sites in the Czech Republic. Study site was included as a random effect. Seasonal distribution of reproductive output was expressed as standardized differentials between the mean hatching dates and mean hatching dates weighted by brood size. Smoothing terms for the effect of a) mean CDD
    <sub>HD</sub>: edf = 1, F = 3.70, p = 0.061; b) trendDMR: edf = 1, F = 3.40, p = 0.072; and c) ln(density): edf = 1.82, F = 3.22, p = 0.054. See legend of
