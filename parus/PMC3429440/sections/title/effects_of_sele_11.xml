 <div class="title">Effects of selected covariates on mean hatching date of the red-backed shrike.</div>
 <p>Modelled by GAMM was the effect of mean May temperature (T
  <sub>MAY</sub>), mean seasonal daily mortality rate (DMR) and ln-transformed breeding density [ln(density)] across four sites in the Czech Republic. Study site was included as a random effect. The fitted smooth functions indicate effect size with its 95% confidence intervals of a given factor (smoothing terms for the effect of T
  <sub>MAY</sub>: edf = 1, t = −3.50, p = 0.0011; DMR: edf = 1, t = 1.50, p = 0.14 and ln(density): edf = 1, t = −5.36, p&lt;0.001). Partial residuals of the response are obtained by varying the effect of the explanatory variable concerned, while leaving all other variables fixed. See
