 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used temperature data from a U.S. Forest Service weather station located within 1 km of and within the same elevational band as our study plot (490 m ASL), at which daily mean temperatures have been recorded since 1956. We defined spring temperature as the annual mean of mean daily temperatures recorded from 15 March through 18 May (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059467-t001" href="#pone-0059467-t001">Table 1</a>). This start point (15 March) is relevant to warbler breeding initiation because temperature accumulation after 15 March has been linked to the advancement of spring leaf phenology 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Richardson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Richardson1">[25]</a> and the development potential in Lepidoptera 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Reynolds1">[24]</a> at Hubbard Brook. This endpoint (18 May) is relevant to warbler breeding initiation because most birds have settled on territories by 15–20 May, with nest initiation beginning 3–7 days after arrival, depending on weather conditions 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>. We examined temporal changes in temperature in linear regression models with spring temperature as the response and year as the predictor. For this and other models in which we looked for a trend over time, we first carried out preliminary analyses to test the assumption of no temporal autocorrelation across years. Following Zuur et al. (2009) 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Zuur1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Zuur1">[36]</a>, we regressed mean annual values of each response variable (temperature, start date, and standardized selection differentials (SSD)) against year in ordinary linear regression models (function “gls” in R library “nlme”). We re-ran each model with (1) an auto-regressive model of order 1 (AR-1) auto-correlation structure, specifying the “corAR1” correlation option with respect to year, and (2) a compound symmetry auto-correlation structure, specifying the “corCompSymm” correlation option with respect to year. We compared the models with and without auto-correlation structure using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). Models with ΔAIC values &lt;2 were considered to have equal support given the data. We found no evidence that including either auto-correlation structure improved fit of models with temperature or start date as the response variable (ΔAIC &lt;2), and we did not incorporate them into subsequent models. However, the AR-1 auto-correlation structure did improve the fit of the model with mean SSD as the response variable (ΔAIC &gt;2), and we used this structure in subsequent analyses of SSD. All statistics were carried out in R v. 2.11.1

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spring temperatures were the average of daily means from 15 March through 18 May each year, recorded at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For analyses of individual start date and annual fecundity, we included only pairs for which we had complete reproductive information for a given year (n = 309 pair-years; distribution of pair-years across years shown in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0059467-t001" href="#pone-0059467-t001">Table 1</a>). These pair-years were associated with 234 males, 263 females, and 297 pairs because some birds bred in multiple seasons. For analyses involving first lay date, we included initiation date of only the first clutch produced in each pair-year. We excluded data from pair-years for which first recorded clutch was initiated more than 24 days (the length of a nesting cycle) after the first clutch initiated in that year because these likely represented cases in which we missed their initial nesting attempt of the season. Similar cut-off dates have been used in other studies of first lay date 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Both4" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Both4">[38]</a>. Patterns of lay date and fecundity with spring temperature were comparable without this 24-day filter (data not shown). We used total number of young fledged from all clutches produced in each of the pair-years as the measure of annual fecundity. For analyses of clutch size with lay date, we considered only first clutches per territory because clutch size tends to be smaller for second clutches and renests 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the effect of variation in temperature on mean first lay date in a linear mixed effects model (LME) fit by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) (R extension package “nlme”), specifying first lay date as the response and spring temperature, year, and breeder age class as fixed effects. We included breeder age class because prior studies indicate that both male and female age class can affect clutch initiation date 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes2">[29]</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>. Pairs were categorized as (1) yearling males and females; (2) yearling males and older females; (3) older males and yearling females; and (4) older males and females. To account for non-independence of responses within years and for repeated measures of individual birds across years, we examined the full model with year (here specified as a categorical factor), male breeder, female breeder, or breeding pair as varying-intercept random effects, and then compared these models to a model without random effects using AIC 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Zuur1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Zuur1">[36]</a>. We found support for an effect of year (ΔAIC &gt;2), but no support for an effect of breeder identity (ΔAIC &lt;2), and therefore included only year as a random categorical effect in subsequent models. We then determined optimal fixed structure of covariates by sequentially dropping the least significant term (likelihood ratio test; α = 0.05 level) and refitting the model 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Zuur1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Zuur1">[36]</a>. Significant probability values were derived from the optimal model, whereas values for non-significant terms were derived by individually reintroducing each non-significant term into the optimal model.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examined relationships among first lay date, temperature, double brooding, and fecundity using generalized linear mixed models (GLMERs) fit by the Laplace approximation (R extension package “lme4” 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Bolker1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Bolker1">[39]</a>). First, we examined the effects of first lay date and breeder pair age class on: the probability of double brooding after successfully fledging a brood (0/1; binomial distribution), annual fecundity (Poisson distribution), and size of first clutch (Poisson distribution). Second, to examine how spring temperature directly affected warbler fecundity, we specified spring temperature as a predictor instead of lay date in each of these models. Finally, we tested for effects of double brooding and breeder age class on annual fecundity (Poisson distribution). Parameter estimates from GLMERs with binomial and Poisson distributions were given in the logit and log scale, respectively. As before, year (specified as a categorical factor) was retained as a random effect in the final models (ΔAIC &gt;2), but breeder identity was not because it did not improve model fit (ΔAIC &lt;2).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated standardized selection differentials (SSDs) to quantify the strength of selection for an earlier lay date; SSD = (LD
  <sub>w</sub> – LD)/SD), where LD = mean annual first lay date, LD
  <sub>w</sub> = mean annual first lay date, weighted by the number of offspring fledged per territory, and SD = annual standard deviation of first lay date. Negative differentials suggest selection for early laying, with strength of selection increasing with distance from zero, whereas positive differentials suggest selection for later breeding 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Goodenough1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Goodenough1">[13]</a>. We used number of offspring fledged per territory per year as our index of reproductive success, rather than number of breeding recruits in the next breeding season, because return of yearlings to their natal site is extremely low 
  <a rid="pone.0059467-Holmes3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0059467-Holmes3">[30]</a>. We examined temperature effects on selection pressure using in an ordinary linear regression model with selection differential as the response and year and mean spring temperature as predictors. We specified the “corAR1” correlation option with respect to year to account for non-independence of residuals among years.
