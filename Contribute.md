# Contribute

In the initial phases of the project aimed at freeing all climate change research and having it published as open access. Help is needed in creating a knowledgebase via **listing important information** and in the **extraction of information from publication databases**.

## Tasks

The proposed workflow: a. list initially held as .MD files, linked below, b. Communications to take place in the GitHub issues area. 

Gitter chat https://gitter.im/open-climate/community and use the hashtags on Twitter #openclimate and #eLifeSprint

### Make lists of:

1. List [climate change related fields](lists/fields.md). 
1. [Types of publication](lists/types.md): papers, PhDs, grey literature, reports, etc.
1. What are the [sources](lists/sources.md) for research publications?: Closed commercial publishing; Publishers, journals, companies, think tanks, governments; Preprint; Collections; Repositories.
1. Climate change related [collections](lists/collections.md): publisher collections, university repositories, etc.
1. Open access vs. closed research [publishing statistics](lists/stats.md).
1. List [initiatives](lists/iniatives.md) for making climate change research OA. Domain specific, general, for the public and demographics, types, etc.
1. [Literature survey](lists/literature.md) of publications on the topic of 'climate change and open access publishing'.

### Extraction issues
- scanned handwriting (ships' logs)
- scanned typewriting (e.g. camera-ready)
- scanned typeset (e.g. tables of temperatures)
- born-digital word/latex (e.g. theses)
- PDFs in journals
- PDFs in reports
- HTML from websites
- XML
