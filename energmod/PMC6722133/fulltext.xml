A sub-picosecond reorganisation of the hematite structure has been proposed as the mechanism which dictates carrier lifetimes, energetics and the ultimate conversion yields. However, the importance of this reorganisation for actual device performance is unclear. Here we report an in situ observation of charge carrier self-localisation in a hematite device, and demonstrate that this process affects recombination losses in photoelectrochemical cells. We apply an ultrafast, device-based optical-control method to resolve the subpicosecond formation of small polarons and estimate their reorganisation energy to be ~0.5&#x02009;eV. Coherent oscillations in the photocurrent signals indicate that polaron formation may be coupled to specific phonon modes (&#x0003c;100&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

One of the developing technologies is based on photoelectrochemical cells (PECs), which combine a photovoltaic module with a multielectron catalyst to drive photoelectrochemical conversions. In a water-splitting PEC used to make H<sub>2</sub>, the most demanding reaction is the four electron oxidation of water to oxygen responsible for providing the reducing equivalents to drive the fuel synthesis. In nature, this reaction is achieved within the complex structures of Photosystem II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, whilst artificially, the best candidates are those based on stable metal oxides. Amongst these, hematite (&#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) has received most attention, and is the focus of intensive work in the photocatalytic community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This is due to its characteristic red colouration as well as the abundance and intrinsic stability of iron oxides. Despite extensive synthetic efforts to improve PECs based on &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> over the last decades, conversion efficiencies remain modest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Previous research has indicated that ultrafast recombination of electrons and holes is the major efficiency loss channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, more recently, a series of ultrafast X-ray studies have suggested that the light-induced reorganisation of the crystal structure in the presence of excess charges, known as polaron formation, ultimately determines the dynamics of the excited state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Such polarons not only impact photoconversion yields but have also been postulated to limit the device photovoltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, thus restricting charge transfer to the electrolyte. These findings are encouraging as they identify key molecular-level parameters which can be used to aid new synthetic strategies that improve photocatalytic performances. However, while the importance of polaron formation is increasingly accepted, many aspects of the energetics, formation kinetics and recombination dynamics within actual working devices have remained inaccessible by all-optical spectroscopic methods, and are therefore the subject of intense debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A polaron is formed when an injected charge carrier interacts with the surrounding lattice and deforms it. In polarisable, soft materials, a strong electron&#x02013;phonon coupling can cause the charge to self-trap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Depending on the nature of the electronic structure and the extent of the electron&#x02013;lattice interaction, both highly localised small polarons, or more delocalised large polarons, can be formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Polaron formation can impact photocatalysis in several ways. On one hand, the relaxation associated with self-trapping effectively reduces the energy of the photogenerated charge, limiting the photoinduced Fermi level splitting of the material, and thus the photovoltage that can be obtained. On the other hand, the movement of the self-trapped charge is slow and thermally activated, which can lead to higher recombination losses thus limiting the lifetime of reactive charges and consequently photoconversion yields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The transport of small polarons is significantly slower than that of large polarons or band transport that is characteristic of conventional semiconductors. For instance, electron transport in &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> times slower than that of the band-type transport in Si<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Such sluggish transport properties have a negative impact on small-polaron conductors used for energy-conversion applications, and in hematite results in the need to shorten the diffusion path to a few nanometres by using meso-structured electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Polarons are particularly relevant to photocatalysts based on transition metals, as these systems are prone to carrier localisation phenomena due to a strong electron correlation within the valence <italic>d</italic>-orbitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Specifically for &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, recent extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) experiments have demonstrated the formation of localised (electron) Fe<sup>2+</sup> polaronic states upon photoexcitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These groundbreaking experiments have opened new avenues for exploring the photophysics of &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; however, due to the complex nature of the techniques, the measurements cannot be performed under operation conditions (e.g., low illumination or interactions with electrolyte and fields in an electrochemical cell)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and thus may not provide device-relevant data. In this work, we directly address this issue and employ a device-based methodology to elucidate the role of small polarons in an &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> photoelectrochemical device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energetics of polaron formation</title><p id="Par5">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows a real-space image of a delocalised electron injected into &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Initially, the electron wave function is delocalised across equivalent Fe centres, forming a diffuse band state. The excess electron can become localised on a single site to form Fe (II), with some polarisation of the neighbouring oxide ions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). This process involves a reorganisation of the lattice (change in configuration coordinate). First-principles calculations show that the stabilisation energy gained upon lattice distortion and localisation, known as the self-trapping energy, is <italic>&#x00394;E</italic><sub>ST</sub>&#x02009;<italic>=</italic>&#x02009;0.48&#x02009;eV, and that the localisation process is barrierless (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). A similar value for the trapping energy is obtained within a continuum dielectric model (see the Methods section for details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. From the self-trapping energy, we estimate an activation barrier for polaron hopping, or transfer between neighbouring localised states, of ~0.2&#x02009;eV, in agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and a distortion radius of r&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.11&#x02009;&#x000c5;, shorter&#x000a0;than the Fe&#x02013;Fe interatomic distance (R&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.99&#x02009;&#x000c5;), confirming the small nature of the polaron. In addition, the large trapping energy and the lack of a barrier are consistent with the ultrafast formation of polarons observed using X-ray methodologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We also find that the localised (small-polaron) state can be readily re-excited to a delocalised band stated by photons of just <italic>&#x00394;E</italic><sub>ph</sub>&#x02009;<italic>=</italic>&#x02009;0.98&#x02009;eV (~1265&#x02009;nm).

We use a device-sensitive technique known as visible-pump-IR-push spectroscopy with photocurrent detection, which has been successfully employed to study polaron states in solid-state organic and hybrid solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but has not yet been applied to photocatalytic systems. In this technique, a pump pulse is used to generate an excited state, and a subsequent IR-push-pulse transfers this population to higher-lying levels (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This IR transition can direct the electron dynamics along an alternative photophysical pathway and affect the device performance. The resulting changes in device output (i.e., the photocurrent, PC) are recorded as a function of the time delay between the pump and push<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. To resolve the formation of localised states in time, we studied a high-efficiency photoelectrode based on a thin (&#x0003c;20&#x02009;nm) hematite layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, which facilitates the extraction of excited carriers before they re-localise. Based on our calculations, we expect that if polaron formation takes place on ultrafast timescales, their re-excitation (push) to a more mobile delocalised state, shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, should lead to an enhancement of device efficiency.

Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the TA spectrum of &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The spectrum is characterised by a photoinduced absorbance across the visible and NIR regions. Whilst the visible features have been mostly assigned to photogenerated holes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the flat spectrum at long (NIR) wavelengths has been associated with the absorbance of electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This signal in &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is primarily attributed to Fe<sup>2+</sup> centres (Fe<sup>3+</sup> +&#x02009;1e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, the absorption of NIR light (photon energy ~1&#x02009;eV) brings electrons to a higher-lying state with a more delocalised wave function. As expected, the TA spectrum is structureless at different times making it a complex assay of dynamics on its own (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The NIR TA kinetics, reflecting the population of electronic states, are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> (blue dots). When the probe arrives after the pump, we observe a sharp increase in absorbance. The rise time is instrument limited, indicating the interaction of the probe with a population created immediately after excitation. Subsequently, the signal decays sharply with a time constant of ~600&#x02009;fs and then plateaus, later being followed by a much slower decay. At high-excitation intensities, we observe an additional fast decay component that accelerates with increasing fluence (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We attribute this to the non-geminate interaction between excited states at high-excitation densities. Similar kinetics on ultrafast timescales have been observed in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, in this work, we focus on the intensity-independent component in the decay. This component, with a time constant of ~600&#x02009;fs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), is the only component present at the illumination intensities relevant for device operation.</p><p id="Par8">The Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> (red dots) shows pump&#x02013;push-photocurrent (PPPC) data from an &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> PEC obtained after pumping at 400&#x02009;nm and pushing at 1200&#x02009;nm (0.96&#x02009;eV). Contrarily to the TA data, we do not observe a sharp rise of the PPPC signal. Instead we observe a gradual increase in the response within the first ~600&#x02009;fs, which plateaus after ~3&#x02009;ps to yield a long-lived state (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> for a larger time range). Because PPPC is only sensitive to the bound states (which lead to losses in the device performance), the observed PPPC signals likely reflect the trapping and/or self-localisation of photogenerated carriers. As expected for resonant interactions, we find that the photocurrent signal amplitude varies linearly with increasing push intensity for a fixed pump power (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>) and with increasing pump power at a fixed push intensity (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Interestingly, at early times, the signal can be represented as the convolution of an exponential decay with an oscillatory feature characteristic of the superposition of coherent (likely vibronic) states, as discussed in detail below.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Charge carrier density and field dependence. <bold>a</bold> Pump&#x02013;push-photocurrent (PPPC) response at early times of the &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> PEC at different pump powers and a fixed push power per pulse (1.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;J pulse<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). <bold>b</bold> PPPC response at a wider time range at different applied potentials vs a Pt counter electrode (see the Methods section for details). <bold>c</bold> Comparison of the TA and PPPC signals across a broad time range.

We propose that photoexcited electrons occupy a delocalised band state, and the transition from this state to higher excited states has a strong transition dipole moment resulting in a strong absorption peak. The formation of the delocalised states is seen as a sharp rise of the TA signal within the time resolution of our measurements. Charges in these states are highly mobile, and do not need extra energy to progress along the photophysical pathway leading to photocurrent generation&#x02014;this is manifested by the absence of PPPC signal at early timescales. Within ~600&#x02009;fs of photoexcitation, band electrons localise into a polaronic state with an apparently lower excited-state absorption dipole. This can be seen as the simultaneous decay of the TA signal and the rise of the push-modulated photocurrent. Our photocurrent data are in agreement with the X-ray data in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, which assigned the fast localisation process to the formation of Fe(II) electron polarons. This process also matches our first-principles calculations, which predict the possibility of re-excitation of small-polaron states to a higher-lying band state with NIR photons. The observed timescale of small-polaron formation is similar to the timescale proposed for &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and other systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but longer than that reported by Carneiro et al. using XUV spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Such discrepancy between experiments could result from differences in excitation power and the density of excited states (lower excitation in this work), or from the differences in the crystallinity of the samples. Nonetheless, the agreement between our device photocurrent data and the X-ray data is striking given the completely different experimental conditions and techniques, and strongly points towards a correlation between the dynamics of the lattice and the electronic energy levels. This is a strong argument for the polaronic behaviour being intrinsic to the material and essential for understanding the device performance.</p><p id="Par10">The oscillatory feature in the PPPC response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) can be extracted and modelled using a damped sinusoidal function with two frequencies (solid line). Analysis of the isolated oscillation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>) reveals two characteristic frequencies at 6.7&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and at 20&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which was associated to confined acoustic vibrations of the oxide lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Such oscillatory behaviours are commonly related with the coherent superposition of vibronic states, and can reveal information about the electron&#x02013;phonon coupling in soft semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In our case, this superposition cannot be prepared by short optical pulses, as polaron states are not populated directly. Instead coherent beatings are impulsively generated via a fast charge transfer between two energy surfaces (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), as the energy uncertainty associated with this process (~55&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is controlled by the transfer rate (~0.6&#x02009;ps). Since we only observe the oscillations in the PPPC signal, we propose that the observed oscillation frequencies reflect the dynamics of the &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> lattice that are specific to the polaronic state, as addressed by the push. We note that higher frequency phonons might also be coupled to the electronic modes; however, the duration of our laser pulses and particularly the rate of polaron formation (~600&#x02009;fs) limit the maximum frequencies of any coherent oscillation that we can observe to ~55&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. While further work is needed to unambiguously establish the nature of the oscillations and elucidate the mechanism by which vibrational modes couple with polaron states, we hypothesise that direct control of such modes might lead to vibronic tuning of the polaronic state as observed in other soft materials and open new routes for device improvements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Our photocurrent measurements reveal the formation of localised, bound states that are detrimental for device performance. While calculations predict an intrinsic small-polaron state, photocatalytically active semiconductors are complex systems which can have a broad range of defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies or grain boundaries) that could also trap carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Here, we are primarily concerned with events taking place within 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;ps of excitation when various structural changes are expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that the TA response of hematite in these timescales is relatively independent on charge-carrier density or the presence of electric fields, and are even comparable between thin films and single crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. These observations are an indication that the sub-picosecond photophysics are dominated by intrinsic rather than extrinsic factors. Furthermore, they can also explain the consistencies in the reported experimental findings despite variations in sample preparation or measurement techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">To further confirm the nature of the localised states we probe in our experiments, we performed measurements as a function of excitation intensity and applied potentials (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>, respectively). In the former case, we do not observe a strong dependence of the carrier localisation kinetics on the concentration of carriers in the system. Instead we observe that the yield (number of localised states per extracted carrier) remains constant at different photon densities. Equally, in the latter case, we do not observe a strong field dependence of the decay within the first 100&#x02009;ps after excitation. Such behaviour is consistent with the formation of small-polaron states that are intrinsic to the material. Comparison of the TA and photocurrent data in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows that the signals match at longer timescales, while the differences at early times can be explained by the contribution of the delocalised band states to the TA. This indicates that beyond a few picoseconds, the polaronic state governs both the optical and photocurrent responses. In this context, it has previously been reported that the TA characteristics of hematite and other metal oxides at long timescales (ns-s) are sensitive to both the excitation intensity and the applied potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. For example, larger anodic applied potentials result in slower kinetics due to the suppression of recombination pathways. This recombination is non-geminate and is therefore found also to accelerate at higher carrier densities. Similar effects were observed for highly correlated oxides, where polaron formation was inferred by X-ray methods, and in which recombination has been proposed to be mediated by defect states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In agreement with these studies, we observe a dependence of the TA signal on excitation power (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>) and on the applied potential (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). This suggests that electron polarons recombine at longer timescales, possibly via trap/defect states, giving rise to characteristic power-law decays, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par13">Polarons play an important role in the charge-carrier mobilities and energetics of organic electronic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Similarly, in perovskite solar cells, large polarons have been proposed to prevent recombination and aid performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Despite the relevance of polaronic states in optoelectronic materials, their role in photoelectrochemical devices has hardly been explored. While strong carrier localisation is generally negative in solar cells (hindered charge extraction), its role in solar-fuel devices might be more complex. For example, delocalised majority carriers might favour charge extraction leading to increased efficiencies. Conversely, localisation of minority carriers might enable multielectron catalysis on atomic sites, thus improving selectivity for the desired transformations. Such a complex balance could explain why &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, despite its polaronic character, remains one of the best photoanode materials. A detailed understanding of the interplay between localisation and delocalisation, and their impact upon carrier dynamics and energetics, is critical to make realistic estimates of photoconversion targets and guide the design of new materials.</p><p id="Par14">In summary, we have tracked the formation of small polarons in &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in real time and demonstrated their impact on photoelectrochemical systems. By employing, for the first time, an optical-control method with photocurrent detection we have bypassed the limitations of all-optical techniques and exposed the impact of ultrafast lattice relaxations in &#x003b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> devices. We expect these phenomena to occur in other metal oxides, especially those based on transition metals. Kinetically, electron polarons impact PECs by limiting transport and charge separation, thereby facilitating the loss&#x000a0;of carriers via recombination; this is particularly critical in PECs involving complex and slow catalytic processes. Energetically, the stabilisation of charges by the lattice relaxation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) can also limit the photovoltage that the PEC can attain and directly limit the chemical transformation that can be achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Indeed, this path has recently been postulated as a mechanism to explain the consistently modest solar-to-chemical conversion efficiencies of hematite photoelectrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Based on our calculations and device measurements, we propose that further synthetic developments must target materials that sustain delocalised wave functions of majority carriers. This might be achieved by reducing the lattice reorganisation energy (<italic>&#x00394;E</italic><sub>ST</sub> in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), thus blocking the formation of the polaronic state, or by increasing the barrier for charge localisation. In addition, the observation of lattice phonon modes of ~7 and ~20&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and their specificity to polaronic states can provide additional information about the dynamics of localisation and how it can be vibronically controlled. From a synthetic viewpoint, modifying the reorganisation energy or localisation barriers is likely to require direct changes in the ligands which bind to the metal centre, or changes in the coordination environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In this context, strategies like the formation of metal oxo-hydroxides and/or the use of multinary oxides, such as ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ferrite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, might aid the control of polaronic states and thus improve device efficiencies for sustainable solar-fuel production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> sample preparation</title><p id="Par15">Hematite samples were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD), as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

A custom-made battery-based power supply was employed to apply a constant voltage. For TA measurements a three-electrode configuration could be used, and a wider applied potential range was explored.
