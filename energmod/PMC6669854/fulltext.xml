In addition, the docking analysis was executed using Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm 4.2, and the macromolecule was kept rigid throughout the docking simulation. The number of genetic algorithm runs was set at 10, and the other docking parameters were left at default values. Ten different conformations were generated for each ligand scored using AutoDock 4.2 scoring functions and were ranked according to their binding energies.

Structure&#x02013;activity relationship studies based on the observed dock score values of the compounds suggest that the presence of amidine group, RC(=NH)-NH<sub>2</sub>, on the compounds could be responsible for the low binding energies and strong binding affinity (<xref rid="table3-1177932219865533" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Also, the presence of amino group on position 2 of the substituted phenyl in <bold>4e</bold> (&#x02013;7.48&#x02009;kcal/mol) increased the binding affinity of the compound as against it being on position 3 as observed in <bold>4h</bold> (&#x02013;7.20&#x02009;kcal/mol). The di-substitution of amino groups on positions 3 and 5 of the substituted phenyl in <bold>4e</bold> did not have a positive impact on the binding energy but rather reduced its binding affinity (&#x02013;6.85&#x02009;kcal/mol) as against the mono-substitutions on position 2 of <bold>4e</bold> and position 3 on <bold>4h</bold>.</p><table-wrap id="table3-1177932219865533" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Energy-based interactions and hydrogen bonds for benzimidazole derivatives <bold>4a-h</bold>, AICAR and AMP docked into modelled <italic>Pf</italic>ADSL.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1177932219865533-table3"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Compounds</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Binding energies (Kcal/mol)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hydrogen bonds and the bond lengths</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
