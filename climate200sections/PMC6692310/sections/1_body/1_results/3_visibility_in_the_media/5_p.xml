<p id="Par22">To further distinguish visibility in the mainstream media, as opposed to blogs and other new media sources, we calculated the fraction 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> of articles associated with each individual published by each media source belonging to the select-30 media source group. The color gradient in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref> indicates the value of 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for the most prominent individuals, revealing how contrarian visibility from mainstream media sources is more concentrated on a relatively small CCC subset. To facilitate group-level comparison, we also calculated the distribution 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) for individuals with 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> ≥ 10 articles (in order to eliminate individuals with large 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> due to small sample size fluctuations). Comparison indicates that, among these more prominent individuals, the average CCS has roughly twice the mainstream prominence as the average CCC; the distribution 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) for the CCSs is also more right-skewed than for the CCCs, see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c, d</xref>. While these results may appear to be inconsistent with the group-wise totals shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>, this apparent discrepancy arises from the fact that multiple CCSs and CCCs can be associated with the same MC article.
