<p id="Par17">Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the citation tally for 224CCC is likely to suffer from generous overestimation relative to the 224CCS tally (see “Methods” for further detail). To be specific, because leading researchers tend to have net citation tallies in the range of 10
 <sup>3</sup>–10
 <sup>5</sup> WOS citations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>, i.e., orders of magnitude greater than the citations accrued by the average papers in their field, the misattribution error associated with name ambiguity only marginally increases the citation tally 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for elite scientists belonging to the 224CCS group; contrariwise, misattribution error could significantly increase 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for the majority of the 224CCC group members. Thus the 660% difference in group-wise citations is a lower-limit estimation of the disparity in scientific authority between these CCS and CCC.
