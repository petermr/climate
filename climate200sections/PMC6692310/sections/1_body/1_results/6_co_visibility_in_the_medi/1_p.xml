<p id="Par32">It was unfeasible to apply the content analysis to the entire dataset, and so we turn to network analysis to identify additional relational patterns of co-visibility within groups and across their media interface. To proceed, we first merged the sets of CCS and CCC media articles. Whereas 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> counts the total number of media articles for individual 
 <italic>i</italic>, the co-visibility 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> ≤ 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> counts the number of articles that feature both individuals 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>. Combining the matrix elements 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> calculated for all pairs of individuals, we construct the symmetric co-visibility matrix 
 <bold>M</bold>. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> shows 
 <bold>M</bold> calculated in two ways: using all media sources and using just the select-30 media sources. Note that individuals with 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 0 are not included in the matrix 
 <bold>M</bold>; and for an individual with 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0, if they do not appear in any media articles with any other individuals, then they are also not included in 
 <bold>M</bold>.
