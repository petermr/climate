<p id="Par29">FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows the frequency of each sourcing type by media source, revealing mentioned as the most common sourcing type. The main exception is FOX, which tends to quote individuals on non-scientific grounds, which is also fairly common in the WP. Another common sourcing are quotes containing scientific content, which are more common for CCSs, as CCCs are rarely associated with this sourcing type. The least common sourcing types observed are non-scientific quotes and adversarial quotes, with most instances of these types associated with CCCs. Notably, the Guardian, NYT, and WSJ featured the most number of articles authored by CCSs.
