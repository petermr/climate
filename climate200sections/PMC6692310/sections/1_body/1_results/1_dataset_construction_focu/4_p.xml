<p id="Par12">Arriving at two lists of prominent CC actors, we then downloaded article metadata covering roughly ∼100,000 CC media articles from the MC project
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>, a public database of media article metadata (see “Methods”), which facilitates large-scale data-driven studies at the intersection of society, politics, and media
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. For each member (hereafter distinguished by the index 
 <italic>i</italic>) of the CCSs and CCCs, we counted how many media articles (given by 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) and in which media sources did he/she receive visibility (hereafter we distinguish media sources by the index 
 <italic>s</italic>). It is important to note that MC data does not include social media posts (e.g., from Facebook and Twitter) and thus represents publicly visible hybrid content (web-only and dual print-web content) from a wide range of content producers, reflecting varying levels of production effort and quality. We also accounted for article multiplicity, i.e., articles within the MC dataset with different hyperlinks and unique article MC identifiers but with the same title and media source (see “Methods” for more details on this MC article disambiguation procedure).
