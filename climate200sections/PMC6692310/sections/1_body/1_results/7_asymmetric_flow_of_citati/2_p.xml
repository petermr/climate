<p id="Par36">In this way, we used the CC citation network to assess the flow of authority between the two research-oriented subsets, 224CCC and 224CCS, at both the group and individual level. We start at the group level, using the ∼50,000 other CC scientists who were not members of either the 224CCC or 224CCS groups as an external self-consistent comparison group. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> shows the proportion of CC scientific article citations flowing between the 224CCC, 224CCS, and CC Other groups, with 224CCS having 17 times the citation authority as 224CCC (20.2% of the total citations from CC Others are directed toward 224CCS, whereas 1.1% are directed toward 224CCC). In direct comparison, the 224CCC cited 224CCS twice as often as in reverse. Even after normalizing citation rates by group productivity, we find that 224CCC cite 224CCS 20 times more frequently than in reverse and that 224CCS receive 79% more citations than they produce (see Supplementary Fig.
