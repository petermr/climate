 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> shows the resulting interpersonal CC citation network, comprised only of scientists who gave or received at least one citation within our WOS dataset. As such, there are only 168 CCCs connected within this citation network. We again used the Louvain algorithm

 </sup> to identify groups of nodes that are densely connected together, representative of coarse research communities. Our results show five communities, each represented as a spine with individuals ranked according to centrality, with the most authoritative individuals located at the apex. Represented as such, the network of scientific authority shows that the majority of CCC are located toward the periphery. Interestingly, the peripheral CCC within each community appear to direct most of their citations toward the most prominent CCS, possibly representing adversarial interaction in the form of negative citations aimed at discrediting their research findings
