<p id="Par45">While the size of the contrarian movement may be relatively small, our study reveals the degree to which new media facilitates the production and mass distribution of assertive content by CCC—which intentionally or not, crowds out the authoritative message of real CCS. To be specific, tallying across all media sources we find CCC media visibility to be 49% greater than CCS visibility. However, if we condition the article count tallies using select mainstream media sources, i.e., sources that implement quality control through more traditional editorial standards [Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>], the media visibility of the two groups is remarkably on par. Only when comparing the visibility of the academically oriented subsets of 224CCC and 224CCS in mainstream media sources do the elite scientists in our study establish a marked visibility advantage (38%)—despite the remaining 280% (publications) and 660% (citations) disparity in scientific authority (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As such, we objectively demonstrate the discrepancy in the scientific authority and media visibility between these two sets of prominent CCS and CCC.
