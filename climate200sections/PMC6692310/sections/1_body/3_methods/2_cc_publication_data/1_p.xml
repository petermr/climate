 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://apps.webofknowledge.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://apps.webofknowledge.com/</ext-link>) using the search query (Climate NEAR/5 Change OR Global NEAR/5 Warming OR Climatology OR Climate NEAR/5 Model OR Climate NEAR/5 Extreme) AND (Climate); this query identifies a broad set of research streams relating to CC, while reducing the inclusion of more general meteorology and environmental research that refers to climate but not in the particular context of CC. Supplementary Fig.Â
