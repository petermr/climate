The first class corresponds to individuals who are mentioned—but not actively involved in the article content. The second corresponds to individuals quoted—and including scientific content. The third corresponds to individuals quoted—but not including scientific content. The fourth corresponds to a scenario similar to the previous category, in which individuals are quoted—including adversarial content aimed at the counterposition.
