<p id="Par57">Because we are comparing the most prominent members from each group, we assume that each individual has already made his/her dominant mark in CC research, and so the measurement bias arising from comparing researchers of different ages and citations from different time periods should not significantly affect the group-wise comparison. Another source of error occurs in the attribution of publications to authors commonly known as the author name disambiguation problem. We used a tested initial-based author name disambiguation approach
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, which nevertheless tends to overestimate the number of publications for a given author, thereby corresponding to a positive misattribution or clumping error. Since not all CCC are career academics or research scientists, this misattribution error tends to artificially boost an unpublished individual’s total number of publications 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> from 0 to 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> ≡ 
 <italic>η</italic> ≥ 0, where 
 <italic>η</italic> is a random variable representing misattribution noise. Since CCSs are by construction experts in the scientific community with 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> ranging from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>3</sup>, the relative error 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>/
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> is significantly smaller for CCSs than for CCCs. It follows that misattribution noise (
 <italic>η</italic>) should affect both groups the same in absolute magnitude, since the group sizes are balanced; however, as a relative percentage, this error inflates the CCC tallies more than the CCS tallies. See Supplementary Note
