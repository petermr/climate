Projecting these individuals across the same backdrop facilitates quantifying disparities in media visibility and scientific authority, and identifying organization patterns within their association networks. Here we show via direct comparison that contrarians are featured in 49% more media articles than scientists. Yet when comparing visibility in mainstream media sources only, we observe just a 1% excess visibility, which objectively demonstrates the crowding out of professional mainstream sources by the proliferation of new media sources, many of which contribute to the production and consumption of climate change disinformation at scale. These results demonstrate why climate scientists should increasingly exert their authority in scientific and public discourse, and why professional journalists and editors should adjust the disproportionate attention given to contrarians.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The role of climate change (CC) contrarians is neglected in climate change communication studies.

Yet, while an anthropogenic cause is supported by an overwhelming majority of climate change scientists (CCS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, climate change contrarians (CCC) have successfully organized a strong voice within politics and science communication in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Historians of science have detailed the political origins of the CCC movement, documenting how its strategic efforts succeeded in distorting the science-based narrative on multiple fronts, e.g., by promoting the idea that there is a lack of scientific consensus concerning anthropogenic CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, despite the fact that objective research has found little evidence for such a claim. One study comparing consensus scientists with unconvinced scientists found that the 2&#x02013;3% of researchers unconvinced by evidence for anthropogenic CC were not only small in group size but also had substantially lower levels of authority in the CC literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Another study surveying &#x0223c;3000 earth scientists found the highest levels of CC consensus to be among the most expert climatologists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Public confusion over science affects various other domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, in addition to CC communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and requires a better understanding of the human, social, and technological factors that facilitate widespread disinformation efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. One salient human factor that contributes to the public&#x02019;s susceptibility to information manipulation is cognitive bias. A particularly relevant example is motivated reasoning&#x02014;the tendency for individuals to bias their judgements according to personal- and group-level values, even when faced with documented facts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Another class of factors are prominent external influences, owing to elite political cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, ideological biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, cultural worldviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and even personal weather experiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Not least among these external factors is the news media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which has a longstanding and dominant role empowering cultural politics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A third decisive technological factor is the paradigm of new media and the nearly boundless scalability of content distribution across the internet. Even in the case where individuals have complete control in choosing their sources of information, they are nevertheless susceptible to significant disparities in content production in addition to being susceptible to media coverage that is disproportionate to the authority and number of scientists holding the consensus viewpoint. Recent research highlights the ramifications of this problem, finding that the acceptance of CC increases (respectively decreases) with consumption of media content that acknowledges (respectively dismisses) CC realities, other factors being equal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Susceptibility to information manipulation may continue to be a serious problem until society fully adapts to managing the sheer range and volume of new media sources. As such, addressing the opportunities and threats facing CC communication requires an integrated understanding of these human, social, and technological factors.</p><p id="Par6">Accordingly, the literature on CC communication is multi-disciplinary. Research efforts draw on a wide range of methods that typically target a single entry point&#x02014;such as applying content and meta-analysis methods to select collections of scientific publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, news media articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, or surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> or by developing behavioral experiments and survey instruments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For example, applying in-depth content analysis to select media article sets, researchers identified common factors among skeptical critics, estimated the percentage of CC articles that contain skeptical elements, and developed a typology of CC skeptics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Building on this framework, another recent study reports that contrarians have strategically shifted away from their external narrative&#x02014;initially based upon challenging fundamental tenets of CC science (e.g., its anthropogenic origins), thereby positioning themselves as skeptics with legitimate scientific motives for dissent&#x02014;to instead challenging assessments of CC impacts in an effort to impede the development of proactive regulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, a separate large-scale analysis of internal documents from 19 contrarian organizations shows that the inward contrarian narrative is still rather focused on CC science, with the relative frequency of science-related topics increasing relative to policy-related topics over the period 2009&#x02013;2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">We complement these extensive efforts by investigating the degree to which socio-technical factors facilitate the visibility and emergence of authority among contrarian claims-makers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. To address this literature gap, we focus our analysis on a group of 386 prominent contrarians, denoted both individually and collectively by CCC. We compare these CCC with 386 prominent scientists active in CC research, denoted hereafter by CCS. These experts in CC science serve as an objective measurement baseline for juxtaposing visibility in the media with authority in the scientific domain. To operationalize this integrative comparison, we collected two large datasets through 2016, comprised of &#x0223c;200,000 CC research articles from the Web of Science (WOS) and &#x0223c;100,000 English-language CC media articles from the Media Cloud (MC) project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. By focusing on a fixed set of individuals, we leverage large-scale data-driven methods of computational social science<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> in an effort to reveal individual-, pair-wise-, and group-level phenomena at the intersection of science and the media.</p><p id="Par8">In what follows, we characterize and compare these CC actors at various levels of aggregation: first, by comparing their scientific authority and media visibility at both the individual and group levels; and second, by mapping their associations that are manifest in media co-visibility networks and scientific co-citation networks. Our approach accounts for the variation in visibility across a wide range of sources, from main-stream to non-mainstream sources. By simultaneously accounting for each individual&#x02019;s scientific authority, our quantitative analysis contributes to the CC communication literature by revealing the degree to which prominent contrarian voices benefit from the scalability of new media, in particular the large number of second-tier news sources and blogs that do not implement rigorous information quality assessment standards. Such disproportionate media visibility of contrarian arguments and actors not only misrepresents the distribution of expert-based beliefs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, it also manifestly undermines the credible authority of career CCS experts and reinforces the trend of CCC presiding over public scientific discourse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, which all together hinders prospects for rapid public action on CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Dataset construction focusing around individuals</title><p id="Par9">CC research and media coverage have grown steadily over the last quarter century, drawing on a range of actors from the scientific, public, media, and policy domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

To be specific, we combined three overlapping sets of names obtained from publicly available sources. The first source is the list of past keynote speakers at Heartland ICCC conferences from 2008 to present; the second is the list of lead authors of the 2015 Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) report; and the third is the list of individuals profiled by the DeSmog project. All together, we constructed a list of 386 prominent contrarians, comprised of academics, scientists, politicians, and business people who are primarily anglophone.</p><p id="Par11">We then collected &#x0223c;200,000 CC research articles from the WOS database, from which we selected the 386 highest cited scientists (denoted by CCSs).

For each member (hereafter distinguished by the index <italic>i</italic>) of the CCSs and CCCs, we counted how many media articles (given by <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and in which media sources did he/she receive visibility (hereafter we distinguish media sources by the index <italic>s</italic>). It is important to note that MC data does not include social media posts (e.g., from Facebook and Twitter) and thus represents publicly visible hybrid content (web-only and dual print-web content) from a wide range of content producers, reflecting varying levels of production effort and quality. We also accounted for article multiplicity, i.e., articles within the MC dataset with different hyperlinks and unique article MC identifiers but with the same title and media source (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; for more details on this MC article disambiguation procedure).</p><p id="Par13">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the 100 most prominent CCCs and CCSs in the media, as well as the 100 most prominent media sources.

For the CCCs, the average (median) visibility is 104 (22.5) articles; similarly for the CCSs, the average (median) visibility is 57.5 (5) articles. In contrast to these characteristic levels, the most visible individuals within each group have <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> in excess of 10<sup>3</sup> articles. In what follows, we also leverage this within-group variation, specifically by normalizing each individual&#x02019;s media visibility by their scientific achievements. This effort demonstrates the robustness of the selection criteria used to identify these two groups and the resulting compositional differences between the two groups. This broad variation points to generic success mechanisms observed in various other social systems, whereby previous achievements facilitate new opportunities, visibility, and reputation growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Yet such cumulative amplification mechanisms cannot fully explain how non-scientific experts are able to compete with scientific experts in the attention economy facilitated by the media.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Prominent climate change contrarians (CCCs) and scientists (CCSs)&#x000a0;in the media. <bold>a</bold> The 100 most-prominent CCCs in the media, ranked according to the number of Media Cloud (MC) articles; although all full names were obtained from publicly available lists, we anonymized CCC names to foster privacy.

Accordingly, we find that only 224 of the 386 CCC have a single publication in our WOS dataset. Thus, in our analysis drawing on scientific publication data, we proceed by comparing just the 224 published CCC with a size-balanced subset comprised of the 224 most-cited CCS.

We analyzed the degree to which this difference is larger (or possibly smaller) than what could be obtained by random chance by performing a random bootstrap sampling of the underlying productivity and citation distributions. Our simulation results show that the disparities are robust to statistical fluctuations arising from finite sample sizes and further demonstrate that the 224CCC productivity and citation impact tallies are indistinguishable from a group of CCC (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the citation tally for 224CCC is likely to suffer from generous overestimation relative to the 224CCS tally (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; for further detail).

These select-30 media sources account for 11% (11,233 articles) of the total media articles analyzed. Because the select-30 media source set was chosen manually, we also compared article counts per group using media source groups identified by an automatic clustering algorithm, which yields consistent results (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Tallying across all media sources, we count 26,072 articles for CCCs, roughly 49% more than the 17,530 articles associated with CCSs (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Tallying across just the select-30 sources, we obtain nearly equal counts: 2482 articles for CCCs and 2463 articles for CCSs, corresponding to just a 0.77% excess for CCCs (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Upon further inspection, we found that these count differences also strongly depend on the underlying group composition&#x02014;in addition to the composition of the underlying media sources.</p><p id="Par21">Repeating the comparison using just the subsets of 224 academically oriented individuals, we obtain a negligible difference of just 1% (16,670 articles for 224CCC and 15,896 for 224CCS). Thus conditioning on either visibility in the mainstream media or on visibility by academically oriented individuals yields parity. However, proceeding with the comparison conditioned simultaneously on select-30 sources and academically oriented individuals reveals a 38% media visibility advantage in favor of the elite scientists (1619 articles for 224CCC and 2235 for 224CCS). These results highlight the nuances associated with comparing groups comprised of individuals with fundamentally different professional orientations. Yet even in this latter and most relevant case, where we compare 224CCC and 224CCS in the mainstream media, there still remains a remarkable discrepancy in the scientific authority and media visibility between these more academically oriented scientists and contrarians.</p><p id="Par22">To further distinguish visibility in the mainstream media, as opposed to blogs and other new media sources, we calculated the fraction <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of articles associated with each individual published by each media source belonging to the select-30 media source group. The color gradient in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref> indicates the value of <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for the most prominent individuals, revealing how contrarian visibility from mainstream media sources is more concentrated on a relatively small CCC subset. To facilitate group-level comparison, we also calculated the distribution <italic>P</italic>(<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) for individuals with <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10 articles (in order to eliminate individuals with large <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> due to small sample size fluctuations). Comparison indicates that, among these more prominent individuals, the average CCS has roughly twice the mainstream prominence as the average CCC; the distribution <italic>P</italic>(<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) for the CCSs is also more right-skewed than for the CCCs, see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c, d</xref>. While these results may appear to be inconsistent with the group-wise totals shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>, this apparent discrepancy arises from the fact that multiple CCSs and CCCs can be associated with the same MC article.</p><p id="Par23">Together, these results show that CCCs derive a comparative visibility advantage from non-scientists gaining attention in peripheral non-mainstream media sources. Conversely, the observed parity between CCCs and CCSs in mainstream media sources may reflect media writers seeking journalistic balance when reporting on CC. Indeed, we find that every select-30 media source has provided CCC significant visibility, thereby increasing CCC authority and credibility (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The disproportionate visibility of CCCs, even in mainstream media sources, is reminiscent of early contrarian efforts that leveraged the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Fairness Doctrine to obtain equal press time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While this policy was officially discontinued in 1987, journalists may still be using it to justify mentioning and interviewing counterpositions when writing on contentious issues such as CC. Indeed, communication scholars have noted that, in the case of CC, such disproportionate visibility&#x02014;or false balancing&#x02014;is likely to mislead public perception, suggesting falsely that within the scientific community there is parity in the number of scientists who do and do not agree on the fundamental issues of anthropogenic CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Juxtaposing authority and visibility at the individual level</title><p id="Par24">To test whether the discrepancy in scientific authority and media visibility is also present at the individual level, and not the result of just a few outliers driving group totals, we disaggregated the WOS and MC data into individual profiles.

For each article, we located individuals&#x02019; names and inferred the context associated with their sourcing, which we annotated according to five types (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; for further details).

The main exception is FOX, which tends to quote individuals on non-scientific grounds, which is also fairly common in the WP. Another common sourcing are quotes containing scientific content, which are more common for CCSs, as CCCs are rarely associated with this sourcing type. The least common sourcing types observed are non-scientific quotes and adversarial quotes, with most instances of these types associated with CCCs. Notably, the Guardian, NYT, and WSJ featured the most number of articles authored by CCSs.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>How climate change contrarians (CCCs) and climate change scientists (CCSs) are sourced in CC articles&#x02014;by media source. <bold>a</bold> Frequency distribution showing how individuals are sourced in media articles according to five types separated into two categories: mentioned (purple) and contributed (green).

These percentages are likely to be a lower-bound estimate to the frequency of balanced sourcing of individuals from each group within the same article, since it is also possible that individuals not included in our select sets of 386 individuals were also mentioned or contributed to these articles.

Interestingly, the peripheral CCC within each community appear to direct most of their citations toward the most prominent CCS, possibly representing adversarial interaction in the form of negative citations aimed at discrediting their research findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">CC is a wicked multidimensional problem, whereby individual dimensions&#x02014;i.e., environmental, socio-economic, technological, science communication&#x02014;while separately challenging, together pose the 21st century&#x02019;s pre-eminent grand challenge. In this regard, a public that is unaware of the realities and risks associated with CC poses a threat to society and planet by undercutting strenuous global efforts to rapidly mitigate threats to the planet&#x02019;s biosphere.</p><p id="Par40">Understanding Earth&#x02019;s coupled human&#x02013;environmental systems requires broad and deep knowledge of processes occurring across a range of scales&#x02014;from microscopic chemical processes to macroscopic thermodynamic flows and human consumption and land-use trends that span the entire global system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The monumental task of drawing together and integrating expertise across numerous research domains will require intense trust-based collaboration across disciplinary, organizational, and political boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. To this end, the consortium science framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>&#x02014;whereby teams of teams organize around a common goal, with a mission to share returns both within and beyond organizational boundaries&#x02014;is an appropriate model for facilitating cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange and achieving the transformative breakthroughs needed to address this grand challenge. We see this collaborative pattern in the structure of citations within the broader CCS community documented here (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), but not within the CCC community, which is too small to encompass the complexity required to grapple with the fundamental issues of CC science. At the same time, this complexity poses a significant challenge to communicating climate science to the broader public, which makes the public discourse on climate science more vulnerable to the opinions of contrarians whose prominence in the media is disproportionate to their representation in the scientific community.</p><p id="Par41">Indeed, communicating authoritative information about the risks of inaction is crucial for achieving global action. Yet, sending uniform and authoritative messages is challenging for various reasons. One reason is that CC communication often requires strategically paring down this wicked problem for non-expert audiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. A related problem is the diminishing demand for expertise in scientific discourse aimed at the public<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. These problems are further exacerbated by the proliferation of new media, which democratize the production and consumption of information, making it increasingly challenging to identify trustworthy information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Unless countered by improvements to quality control management that can match the production scale, this information deluge is likely to overwhelm the traditional safeguards of professional editorial oversight.</p><p id="Par42">Against this background, we contribute to the CC communication literature on authoritative messengers and new media by analyzing two carefully selected groups of prominent individuals who are frequently sourced in CC media articles. In order to operationalize this individual-centric approach, we located the digital footprints of 772 individuals in &#x0223c;200,000 research publications indexed by the WOS and &#x0223c;100,000 media articles produced by both traditional and new media sources based primarily in North America and Europe. Thus, by juxtaposing media visibility and scientific authority for two counter-positional groups, we are able to objectively measure the discrepancy in CC authority between consensus scientists (CCS) and contrarians (CCC). In particular, by contrarians we refer to individuals frequently sourced by institutions denying the documented realities of CC and its consequences and/or individuals who have personally expressed inaccurate statements. As such, we selected CCC using open registries that clearly document their contrarian positions.</p><p id="Par43">There are several limitations to our data-driven analysis worth first discussing. First, we do not account for the range of professional backgrounds, nor do we account for the different types of skepticism promoted by different CCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. By way of example, recent work comparing fundamental skepticism (relating to sources and existence of CC) to impact skepticism (relating to potential impacts of CC) reveals that the frequency of the fundamental skepticism has decreased over time, whereas the frequency of impact skepticism has increased over time, possibly signaling a strategic shift within the contrarian movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. While distinguishing visibility according to these two skeptic types could explain some variation in media visibility observed across individuals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in-depth content analysis to assess individuals&#x02019; relative positions on CC was not feasible nor the aim of our study but rather serves as an avenue for future research.</p><p id="Par44">A second limitation relates to the sampling of fixed group sizes of 386 individuals from global populations of contrarians and scientists who differ greatly in their size. As such, the disparity in visibility may be affected in part by there being relatively fewer (greater) number of contrarians (scientists) combined with journalists seeking balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Another source of variation that limits the interpretation of our comparison is the composition of the CCC group, which includes business people and politicians in addition to skeptic scientists, thereby reflecting the same drivers of variation underlying the primary frames (e.g., science, culture and society, political economics, and environment) identified within a corpus of newspaper articles on CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We addressed this compositional difference in several ways. First, we restricted our analysis to the time period before the 2016 US presidential election so that media visibility is more reflective of the scientific rather than the political arena; second, we focused our analysis of scientific authority drawn from peer-reviewed research on the subset of 224 CCCs who did appear in the publication data, and compared&#x000a0;them with a size-balanced set of 224 CCSs; and third, we compared the two groups using normalized media visibility measures in order to account for variation in scientific authority between the 224CCC and 224CCS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this way, we explored alternative explanations for observed discrepancies in visibility and authority. One final limitation relates to how individuals appear in media articles, as we do not distinguish whether individuals are sourced as experts or dismissed as illegitimate authorities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, as in the case of positive and negative citations, our measures of media visibility are partially conflated by dismissive mentions.</p><p id="Par45">While the size of the contrarian movement may be relatively small, our study reveals the degree to which new media facilitates the production and mass distribution of assertive content by CCC&#x02014;which intentionally or not, crowds out the authoritative message of real CCS. To be specific, tallying across all media sources we find CCC media visibility to be 49% greater than CCS visibility. However, if we condition the article count tallies using select mainstream media sources, i.e., sources that implement quality control through more traditional editorial standards [Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>], the media visibility of the two groups is remarkably on par. Only when comparing the visibility of the academically oriented subsets of 224CCC and 224CCS in mainstream media sources do the elite scientists in our study establish a marked visibility advantage (38%)&#x02014;despite the remaining 280% (publications) and 660% (citations) disparity in scientific authority (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As such, we objectively demonstrate the discrepancy in the scientific authority and media visibility between these two sets of prominent CCS and CCC.</p><p id="Par46">In order to provide contextual depth, we also analyzed how these prominent individuals are sourced within media articles&#x02014;are they just mentioned or do they contribute content via quotes or authorship? This assessment involved full-text analysis of &#x0223c;2,000 media articles from 6 prominent media sources: Guardian, NYT, WP, FOX, LAT, and the WSJ. Our results point to an additional level of discrepancy&#x02014;CCCs are more likely than their counterparts to be mentioned or contribute via non-scientific quotes, whereas CCSs are more likely to contribute via scientific-oriented quotes or authorship. FOX News and the WSJ are two exceptions to these patterns, as they tend to source quotes and authorship contributions from CCCs and CCSs more equally. Research shows that journalists often quote contrarians either to infuse objectivity or to dismiss their position outright<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Yet, these approaches also detract attention from the relevant CC narrative and provide the counterproductive impression that there is something substantial in contrarian arguments to be debated. Thus the time has arrived for professional journalists and editors to ameliorate the disproportionate attention given to CCCs by focusing instead on career experts and relevant calls to action.</p><p id="Par47">Our individual-centric approach also provides insight into the structural properties of the consensus&#x02013;contrarian interface. Analysis of the interpersonal citation network reveals that 224CCS are cited by the remaining CC community 17 times more frequently than 224CCS. Even accounting for productivity differences, we find that 224CCC cite 224CCS 20 times more frequently than in reverse. Similar analysis of the media co-visibility network shows that 52% of the associations are between CCCs, whereas only 12% are between CCSs, an additional disparity pointing to manifest organizational differences, such as the contrarian echo chamber illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.</p><p id="Par48">In summary, our work contributes to recent computational social science efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> by leveraging new opportunities in large-scale data collection and analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> to clarify both the individual and collective properties of complex socio-technical systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

Indeed, despite the challenges posed by new media, there are also new opportunities. One relevant example that borrows from the post-publication peer-review system in science is the new media tool climatefeedback.org<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, which allows expert scientists the opportunity to annotate, grade, and correct inaccurate CC information published in the media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>MC data</title><p id="Par49">We collected a dataset of 121,729 unique print articles, online articles, and blog posts on CC from 01 January 2000 to 01 October 2016 from 7126 unique media sources from the MC project, an open data project hosted by the MIT Center for Civic Media and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &#x00026; Society at Harvard University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/mediacloud">https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/mediacloud</ext-link>).

One clear limitation of our&#x000a0;MC dataset is that it is biased toward English-language content (98.6% of articles analyzed are classified as English language by MC); however, since the discourse on CC began in the scientific domain, where English is also the de facto communication language, we do not believe this regional bias significantly affects our comparative results within the domain of English-based science and media content.</p><p id="Par51">We then refined the dataset by applying the following media article disambiguation method. Upon close inspection of individual MC article metadata, we found that a significant number of articles indexed by MC refer to the same media article. We found this to be particularly common among the select-30 media sources included in our content analysis, in which the same article may have multiple different URLs, representing an array of hyperlinks from different facets of their website&#x02014;e.g., blog section, RSS feed section, and front page&#x02014;to a common media article. As such, the initial set of 121,729 MC articles requires an additional merging procedure in order to avoid overcounting, resulting in a final dataset of 102,250 unique MC articles.</p><p id="Par52">While two or more MC articles may have unique MC article identifiers, inspection of the URL and article title indicate that they are indeed the same. By way of example, consider the following MC articles: the first is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/science/exxon-mobil-climate-change-global-warming.html?partner=rss&#x00026;emc=rss">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/science/exxon-mobil-climate-change-global-warming.html?partner=rss&#x00026;emc=rss</ext-link>,&#x000a0;with MC title <italic>State Officials Investigated Over Their Inquiry Into Exxon Mobil&#x02019;s&#x000a0;Climate Change Research</italic> and&#x000a0;MC unique identifier 468593919 (the unicode HTML encoding for the apostrophe (') symbol is intentionally left uncleaned in order to illustrate challenges in excess of simple string matching); and the second is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/science/exxon-mobil-climate-change-global-warming.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/science/exxon-mobil-climate-change-global-warming.html</ext-link>, with MC title <italic>State Officials Investigated Over Their Inquiry Into Exxon Mobil&#x02019;s Climate Change Research</italic> and&#x000a0;MC unique identifier 468588600.</p><p id="Par53">We addressed this redundancy by merging articles with the same MC media source and similar title into a single article instance so that article counts for sources and individuals are not systematically inflated.

Another source of error occurs in the attribution of publications to authors commonly known as the author name disambiguation problem. We used a tested initial-based author name disambiguation approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, which nevertheless tends to overestimate the number of publications for a given author, thereby corresponding to a positive misattribution or clumping error. Since not all CCC are career academics or research scientists, this misattribution error tends to artificially boost an unpublished individual&#x02019;s total number of publications <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> from 0 to <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>&#x02009;&#x02261;&#x02009;<italic>&#x003b7;</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0, where <italic>&#x003b7;</italic> is a random variable representing misattribution noise.

As such, it is likely that individuals sourced in this way did not actively contribute to the production of the media article, and so these mentions do not necessarily confer any privileged expert status upon the individual. However, the remaining four categories reflect some level of contribution by the individual&#x02014;either active in the case that they were interviewed or passive in the case that statements were quoted from external text, e.g., from a research publication. In the case of quoted categories (2&#x02013;4), we do not distinguish between quotes derived from external sources (e.g., media articles, reports, or scientific publications) or quotes derived from personal interview. We then group sourcing categories (2&#x02013;5) together into a combined contributed category to facilitate direct comparison with the mentioned category. This approach follows a framework for evaluating references to the IPCC and non-select contrarians in the media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.
