<p>The current variation in average temperature (2010–2019) and the projected rise at the end of the 21st century (2090–2099) in Japan according to the four RCP scenarios are shown in Figure S2. The projections show a clear marked increase in average temperatures under high-end emission scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5); however, this increase slowed or tended to be reduced after a number of decades under climate change scenarios that assume greenhouse-gas mitigation policies (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) (Figure S2). A decrease in greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the 21st century may avert warming in Japan, with an average rise in temperature of 0.6°C (range: 0.4, 0.9) under RCP2.6, 1.8°C (range: 1.4, 2.2) under RCP4.5, and 2.5°C (range: 1.8, 3.0) under RCP6.0 in comparison with 4.1°C (range: 3.0, 4.9) under RCP8.5. The respective data from each prefecture are shown in Figures S3 and S4.</p>
