<p>Projected patterns in heat- and cold-related excess morbidity in diarrhea in Japan according to three RCPs are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Our findings demonstrated a similar pattern of a decrease in cold-related morbidity in diarrhea and slight rise in excess morbidity as a result of heat across the RCP scenarios. The projections showed steeper gradients for RCP8.5, whereas shallower trends were observed for scenarios that assumed mitigation strategies across the 21st century. Our results projected a steep decrease in cold-related excess morbidity in diarrhea from 62.5% (95% eCI: 57.4, 65.6) in the period 2010–2019 to 49.5% (95% eCI: 42.0, 57.1) in the period 2090–2099 under warming scenarios (RCP8.5), whereas the gradient gradually decreased under RCP2.6, ranged from 62.6% (95% eCI: 57.4, 65.5) in the period 2010–2019 to 61.2% (95% eCI: 56.0, 64.9) in the period 2090–2099. The heat-related excess morbidity in diarrhea was projected to rise from 5.7% (95% eCI: 4.4, 6.8) to 9.7% (95% eCI: 4.9, 12.0) under RCP8.5 across the same period, whereas the gradient gradually increased under RCP2.6, ranged from 5.8% (95% eCI: 4.4, 6.9) in the period 2010–2019 to 6.3% (95% eCI: 4.7, 7.6) in the period 2090–2099. The respective data from each prefecture are shown in Figures S6 and S7.
