<p>Our results have practical implications for refining or adjusting estimates for climate changeâ€“related infectious gastroenteritis in future public health policies. Our study projects the greatest reduction in net excess infectious gastroenteritis morbidity in Japan due to climate change under higher emission scenarios. The majority of the excess morbidity was attributable to low temperatures, and heat was associated only with a small fraction of excess morbidity. Additionally, the reduction in temperature-related net excess morbidity is expected to be significant in scenarios of high greenhouse gas emissions. These findings are important because there may be no specific public health action for climate and diarrhea, and the current international dialog should be advised that the impact of climate change on diarrhea may vary by types of diseases and areas.</p>
