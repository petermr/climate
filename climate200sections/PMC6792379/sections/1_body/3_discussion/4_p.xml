<p>Our findings suggest that variations in temperature-related excess infectious gastroenteritis in Japan are proportional to the degree of global warming modeled in each of the RCP emission scenarios. We found that the largest net decrease in excess morbidity occurred for RCP8.5, which assumes very high greenhouse gas emissions (

There is insufficient knowledge about climate effects on different types of diseases, and our results emphasize the importance of further investigations into projections of global warming and the associated impacts on mortality and morbidity due to different pathogens.
