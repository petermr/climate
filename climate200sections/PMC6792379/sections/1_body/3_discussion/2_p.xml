<p>Our study showed that climate change may potentially lead to a net reduction in temperature-related infectious gastroenteritis in Japan. Our findings also predicted a marked decrease in cold-related excess morbidity in diarrhea under higher emission scenarios and a relatively mild rise in heat-related excess morbidity in diarrhea in Japan. These results are in agreement with recent reports based on long-term data on the scale of centuries to millennia of human epidemic events, which suggest that cooling, rather than warming, increases the incidence of human epidemics (

However, it is difficult to assess the evidence presented in this global study because it did not relate the final results to present disease burden. Additionally, future socioeconomic and demographic changes may decrease the effect of temperature on diarrheal disease transmission. Moreover, the discrepancy may also be because most previous studies that have investigated the impact of climate change on the prevalence of diseases mainly used short-term data (4 to 9 y). Our results emphasize the importance of further investigation into projections of global warming and the associated effect on morbidity due to infectious gastroenteritis by adjusting for future socioeconomic and demographic factors and more long-term data than are currently available.
