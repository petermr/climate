<p>In the second stage, we combined prefecture-specific estimates using multivariate meta-regression models to predict the association between nationwide nonlinear temperature and morbidity (

 <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Gasparrini and Armstrong 2013</xref>). To account for the effect modification attributed to different temperature distributions between prefectures, prefecture-specific gross domestic product (GDP), mean temperature, and temperature range were also included in the model as meta-predictors. We then derived the best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative associations between temperature and morbidity in each prefecture. The best linear unbiased prediction represented a trade-off between the prefecture-specific association and the prefecture-pooled association. This approach enabled areas with a small number of weekly cases or a short time series to use information from larger populations sharing similar characteristics. This analysis method was detailed previously (
