<p>For sensitivity analysis, temperature–morbidity relationships were estimated by creating a synthetic daily time series of outcome. We generated a daily series for infectious gastroenteritis cases by assigning uniform daily outcome counts within each week. The choice to perform the sensitivity analysis at daily level was motivated by our aim to evaluate the information in the observed distribution (especially the variability) of the daily mean temperature. This information has been used in the bias-correction procedure, which is an important step in deriving projection of health impact. We computed the projected daily time series of infectious gastroenteritis cases, projecting the average synthetic daily counts across each year of the projection period (1990–2099). In a different type of sensitivity analysis, we used exposure–response curves calculated using weekly data, but we calibrated the projected time series of daily mean temperature using the observed distribution of daily mean temperature, and the time series of daily outcome were projected using uniform distribution of events within a week. For both simulations, we calculated prefecture-specific attributable fractions using the same procedure for the main analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using the dlnm and mvmeta packages in R (version 3.5.1; R Development Core Team).</p>
