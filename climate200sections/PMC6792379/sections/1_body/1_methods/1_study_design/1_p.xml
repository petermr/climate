<p>We used a two-steps time-series modeling framework for projections of climate change effects on health, described in detail elsewhere (

Briefly, in the first step, we used a time-series analysis to assess the association between observed data on temperature and weekly morbidity due to infectious gastroenteritis in all 47 Japanese prefectures. Additionally, we acquired historical (1960–2005) and projected (2006–2099) average daily temperature time series according to climate change scenarios of the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, using five general circulation models (GCMs) (

In the second step, we computed historical and future projections of excess morbidity in diarrhea attributable to temperature under each RCP using the estimated temperature–morbidity association curve, and modeled temperature and morbidity projections.
