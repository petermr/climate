<p>Additionally, we obtained data on average daily temperatures and precipitation for the period 2005â€“2015 from the Japan Meteorological Agency. Representative data were obtained from a single weather station located in an urban region of the capital city of each prefecture. Hourly measurements across 24 h were averaged to obtain average daily temperatures and precipitation. Additionally, we calculated the weekly means for average temperature and precipitation. Average weekly temperature was used as the main exposure index. Average weekly precipitation was used as the confounding factor because it may be a major driver of waterborne acute infectious gastroenteritis and because it may also evolve in the future due to climate change.</p>
