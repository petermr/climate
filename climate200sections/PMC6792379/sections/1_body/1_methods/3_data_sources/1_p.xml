<p>We obtained national surveillance data on infectious gastroenteritis cases reported in the period 2005–2015 in all 47 prefectures of Japan from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. Infectious gastroenteritis became a notifiable disease in 1999 and is under systematic surveillance according to the Infectious Disease Control Law in Japan. Such surveillance is contributed to by ∼3,000 sentinel medical institutions, which comprise approximately 8% of the total number of pediatric hospitals and clinics in Japan (

A case definition of infectious gastroenteritis comprises clinical symptoms of sudden stomach ache, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fever, nausea, and electrolyte abnormality. Although a report of the number of infectious gastroenteritis cases is generally required every week, this law does not necessitate sentinel medical institutions to disclose laboratory test data. The clinical data are reported electronically to the NIID, and the NIID’s computer system is used to check and validate the data for consistency.
