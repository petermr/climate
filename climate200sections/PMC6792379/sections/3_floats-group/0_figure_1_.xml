  <p>Temperature and excess morbidity in diarrhea in different climates. Hokkaido, Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka Prefecture were selected because these are most populous prefectures of Japan, respectively. The top panels indicate the estimated exposure–response associations between the relative risks [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCI)], with minimum morbidity temperature used as reference, and the two portions identifying increased risks for cold and heat. The dashed part of the curve represents the extrapolation beyond the maximum temperature observed in the period 2010–2019 (dashed vertical line). The mid panels indicate the distribution of the modeled daily temperature series for the current period (2010–2019, light gray area) and at the end of the century (2090–2099, dark gray area), projected using a specific climate model (NorESM1-M) and scenario (RCP8.5). The bottom panels indicate the related distribution of excess morbidity in diarrhea, expressed as the excess morbidity (%) related to nonoptimal temperatures compared with minimum morbidity temperature.</p>

 <alt-text>Figure 1 displays three graphs each for Hokkaido, Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka. Hokkaido (NorESM1-M – RCP 8.5), Tokyo (NorESM1-M – RCP 8.5), Osaka (NorESM1-M – RCP 8.5), and Fukuoka (NorESM1-M – RCP 8.5) plot RR (ranging from 0 to 25 in intervals of 5) in the first graph; temperature distribution (ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 in intervals of 0.02) for 2010 to 2019 and 2090 to 2099 in the second graph; and excess morbidity percentage (ranging from 0.00 to 0.05 in intervals of 0.01) in the third graph (y-axis) across temperature (ranging from negative 10 to 35 degree Celsius in intervals of 5 or 10) (x-axis).</alt-text>
