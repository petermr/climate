    <sup>1</sup> The study used data collected from 67,033 individuals aged 18–64 years in Ontario who participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey in 2005, 2007/08, and 2009/10 to assess their household food insecurity status in the 12 months before the survey interview. The authors linked this with administrative health care data to determine direct health care costs for individuals during the same 12-month period [
