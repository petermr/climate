 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02531-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes potential vulnerabilities to key food system components from climate change impacts. Given the limited literature available in a Canadian context, examples from international studies are used where relevant. Evidence indicates that every component of the food system—production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption—is climate sensitive and can experience impacts from climate change effects. These impacts can cause disruption and challenges to critical activities of the food system.
