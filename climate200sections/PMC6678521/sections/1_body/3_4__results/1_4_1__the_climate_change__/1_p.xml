<p>Few studies and frameworks exist to increase our understanding of the possible impacts of climate change on food security and human health. Commonly, researchers examine the impacts of climate change on food systems or food security, but rarely are implications for human health included in the analysis. Thus, there is no comprehensive or common approach to studying the climate change, food security, and human health nexus, resulting in important knowledge gaps that hinder effective adaptation efforts.</p>
