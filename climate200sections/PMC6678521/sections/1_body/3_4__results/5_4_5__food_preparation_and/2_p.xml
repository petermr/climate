<p>Food safety and nutrition may be the pathways through which climate change impacts have the most direct effect on human health [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nutrition may be challenged as climate change can contribute to shifts in diet composition and diversity [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, country and traditional foods provide important nutritional value and contribute to healthy diets for Indigenous populations [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In northern Indigenous communities in Canada, there has been an observed diet shift from country and traditional foods, to market foods. Climate change impacts on the availability and quality of traditional foods may contribute to this shift [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Market foods are often prepared, processed, and/or frozen, while fresh foods such as fruits and vegetables are not always available [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Foods purchased and consumed are often less nutritious and high in sodium, sugars, and fat, which may contribute to various forms of malnutrition.
