<p>Food production is an essential component of the food system, it encompasses commercial and non-commercial agriculture, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture sectors, as well as the hunting, fishing and harvesting of traditional Indigenous foods. The food production sector is the starting point of the food system, providing the raw ingredients for processing and consumption. Ultimately, if the productivity of the food production sector declines, the availability and supply of food may be challenged. This would have impacts on food security status and, subsequently, human health. </p>
