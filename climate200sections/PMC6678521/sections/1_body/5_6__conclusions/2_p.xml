<p>The framework presented in this paper provides a comprehensive conceptualization of the climate change, food security, and human health nexus, illustrating pathways of vulnerabilities and identifying opportunities for intervention. Analyzing this nexus from a food system lens allows for a broad understanding of food security, capturing the critical dimensions and highlighting vulnerabilities that may be overlooked in the existing literature. The framework will be useful in guiding future research, and can aid in the completion of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments. It can also inform the development and implementation of adaptation and resiliency building actions.</p>
