<p>It is well established that slow- and rapid-onset climate change effects will cause adverse impacts on natural and human systems. Health risks associated with extreme weather and climate events have already been observed, and are increasing globally and in Canada. For example, in 2003, a heat wave in Europe resulted in over 70,000 deaths [

The impacts of climate change will vary across the country, as will demographic, socio-economic, infrastructural, institutional capacity, and health system resiliency. Thus, there will be regional variation in terms of the strength and severity of associated health impacts. Indirect and direct effects of climate change such as temperature extremes, extreme weather events, air pollution, infectious diseases transmitted by vectors, stratospheric ozone depletion, and contamination of food and water [
