<p>To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel analytical framework to study and respond to the climate change, food security, and human health nexus. Current levels of food insecurity in Canada are presented, along with evidence of impacts on health and wellbeing. The framework is then presented, highlighting the complex and multi-sectoral relationships between climate change, food security, and human health. Examples of the Canadian food systemâ€™s components that may be vulnerable to disruption by climate change impacts are identified, followed by analysis of how key pathways of vulnerability can influence food security and human health. </p>
