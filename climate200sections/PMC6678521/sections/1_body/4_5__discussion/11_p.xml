<p>The proposed framework highlights a number of important avenues of investigation related to key climate drivers, factors mediated by human behavior that influence accessibility, utilization, and availability of food and other determinants of poor health outcomes. This can aid researchers in future studies of climate change impacts on food security and health, including the development of health models and of early monitoring and warning systems of climate impacts on the food system. Investigation of unique characteristics and differences in social, political, economic, and environmental factors among urban, rural, coastal, northern, and Indigenous communities can elucidate important vulnerabilities in food systems that can inform the development of effective adaptations by health sector decision makers and those in related sectors. </p>
