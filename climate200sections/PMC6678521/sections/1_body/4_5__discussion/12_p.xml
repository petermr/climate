<p>Consideration of social equity is also important when developing and implementing adaptation actions. For example, Inuit participants of a workshop that focused on developing a strategic plan for food security for the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Northwest Territories, using the results of the 2007â€“2008 Inuit Health Survey, identified housing as a major concern and barrier to achieving food security [

Furthermore, engaging people most affected empowers them to contribute to robust responses and adaptation strategies. Future research on the climate change, food security, and human health nexus, should therefore include considerations of social equity as well as Indigenous knowledge, which contribute to the development of effective responses and adaptation action.
