<p>At the global level an adaptation gap exists in efforts to address impacts of climate change on food insecurity and nutrition. Further efforts to build the evidence base and to develop models that can assist in quantifying the burden of disease related to malnutrition associated with weather extremes are needed to ramp up efforts to protect health [

The relationship of people to infrastructures and markets, for example, is a greater driver of vulnerability to food insecurity than is exposure to climate-related hazards such as droughts and floods [
