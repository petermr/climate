<p>While much of the existing Canadian research on climate change impacts on food security and health is focused on communities north of 60 degrees latitude, knowledge gaps about impacts in this region continue to exist. Furthermore, very little is known about the impacts and implications for regions south of 60 degrees latitude, for Indigenous, rural, and remote communities, as well as urban centers. Given these knowledge gaps, information about health outcomes that might result from climate change impacts, and effective adaptations in the food system, is limited.</p>
