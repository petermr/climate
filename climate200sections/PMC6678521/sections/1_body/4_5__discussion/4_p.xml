<p>The framework demonstrates that the climate change, food security, and health nexus represent an interdisciplinary problem that requires cross-sectoral collaboration for development of effective adaptationsâ€”for example, stakeholders from transportation, agriculture, water, health, environmental conservation, natural resources, urban planning, trade, social programs, and policy and regulations all play a role in the food system. Food systems have many interdependent subsystems that operate over different time and spatial scales [
