<p>Eastern China was selected to verify our results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6</xref>). The NDVI changed from −0.04 to 0.04 in the grid cells where the changes in existing vegetation occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The changes in vegetation type were verified by the changes in the NDVI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6C</xref>). The vegetation changed in the regions where the changes in vegetation types were detected. The actual vegetation changes were compared with the land use change between 1990 and 2000 reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2002)</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Fig. 6D</xref>. The vegetation changes detected by two studies were mainly concentrated in similar regions. The areal changes in certain vegetation types were similar to those obtained using Liu’s land use data (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Larger changed areas of vegetation types were detected in this study than in 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2002)</xref>, because more detailed changes in land use could be detected using the land use data with higher resolution and more detailed vegetation types (24 types).
