<p>A large area of vegetation was transformed by human disturbances (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4C</xref>) by changing the potential vegetation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4B</xref>) to the existing vegetation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4A</xref>) from no human influence period to the period 1982–2013. The impact of human disturbance on the vegetation distribution occurred worldwide from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). The human-induced vegetation changes were not only seen at the boundaries of vegetation types, but also within the regions of vegetation types. About 3% of total vegetation distribution was transformed by human activities from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013. The largest changes in vegetation were found in the eastern China, central Africa and western America.
