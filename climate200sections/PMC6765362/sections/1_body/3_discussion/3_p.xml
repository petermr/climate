<p>The impacts of human disturbance on vegetation were seen worldwide from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1982–2013, except for the polar and desert regions. The areas that were most affected by human disturbance were those with the highest population densities, including Europe, western North America, Central Africa, southern South American, eastern Australia and eastern China. The expansion of pasture mainly took place in central Asia, Australia, southern Africa and in the tropical Sahel and subsequent overgrazing led to transformations in the vegetation cover. The amount of cropland has expanded markedly in North and South America, Europe, southern Australia, northeast China and southern Asia. Grassland has been replaced by farmland in Europe and in North and South America. Cropland has expanded into the shrublands of Australia. The main change in land use in eastern China has been the replacement of forest and grassland with cropland (
