<p>Human disturbance has influenced vegetation for several centuries. The human-induced vegetation changes from no human influenced period to the period 1982–2013 was similar to those reported human-induced land degradation (

Transformations in the distribution of vegetation accelerated when rapid growth in the human population increased the pressure to expand the amount of pasture and farmland. These regions are the key zones with respect to the anthropogenic transformation of vegetation from the no human influence period to the period 1982–2013.
