<p>The vegetation would return to what kind of potential forest type if there is no human disturbance can be referred by the potential vegetation types. The potential vegetation type can restore itself over a period with either limited or no human interference. For instance, abandoned farmland in northeast China can transform back to forest cover. These transformations caused fundamental vegetation changes, and could be reflected in our results. There is a large potential in global tree restoration if human disturbance was limited, which is consistent with the results reported by
