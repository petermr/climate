<p>The relative contributions of human disturbance and climate change on the vegetation changes was separated by comparing the differences between existing vegetation and potential vegetation. Potential vegetation distribution is the vegetation without human disturbances, and it was similar to potential natural vegetation in 1700 as defined by

 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al. (2010)</xref>. The existing vegetation types were classified based on both vegetation and climate data to reflect the connection between vegetation and climate, without using the method that defines the vegetation types based on NDVI data (
