<p>The boundaries of some potential vegetation types were altered by climate changes. A shifting of ecotones seems more likely the result of climate change influencing areas that are borderline based on climate, thus, a small shift in climate is likely to result in a change in ecotones rather than in central vegetation areas. The vegetation in these ecotones was under pressure and would show further changes over time. However, the influence of climate change on vegetation was limited from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013 because climate-induced vegetation shift was not viable over short periods, except when there was an abrupt climate shift. Moreover, the coarse resolution of the data restricted to detect the detail vegetation changes induced by climate change. Climate warming and hot drought would likely cause species composition of regional vegetation (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2011</xref>), not vegetation type change (e.g., forest to grassland), which could not be visible over a short period. However, widespread increased tree mortality has been found in some forest ecosystems because of climate warming (
