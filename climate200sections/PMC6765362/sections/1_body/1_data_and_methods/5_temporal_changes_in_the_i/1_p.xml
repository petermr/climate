 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Fraedrich, Gerstengarbe &amp; Werner (2001)</xref> suggested that an interval of at least 15 years is required to detect temporal changes in the geographical distribution of climate types. Thus, the period from 1982 to 2013 was split into two periods (1982–1996 and 1997–2013), and the existing and potential vegetation types were classified over the two periods to check the temporal changes in the influences of human disturbance and climate change on vegetation distribution.
