<p>How to delimit the influence of human disturbance and climate on the vegetation was outlined in the sketch of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>. The vegetation distribution in the real world could be represented by existing vegetation types which reflected the vegetation distribution under human influences (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017a</xref>). Existing vegetation types include effects of human influences while potential vegetation types exclude these effects. The real vegetation changes could be identified by the changes in existing vegetation over the two periods. The potential vegetation changes are mainly caused by climate changes. The climate-driven vegetation changes could be reflected by the changes in potential vegetation over different periods. The anthropo-driven vegetation changes can be identified by the difference between the changes in potential and existing vegetation.
