<p>The high-resolution climate data was not available for the vegetation classification. Hence, the NDVI data was up-scaled to match the resolution of climate data. The NDVI data were up-scaled by calculating the arithmetic mean of the nearest neighbor grids over a six-by-six window because one grid cell of climate data (0.5° × 0.5°) covers six-by-six grid cells in NDVI data (0.0833° × 0.0833°).</p>
