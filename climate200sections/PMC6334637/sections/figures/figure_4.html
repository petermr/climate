 <caption> Relationship between trends in climate and functional composition of basal area mortality. The y‐axis represents plot trends in water deficit affiliation ( WDA) per year calculated as the linear slopes of basal area‐based community weighted mean within the losses and x‐axis shows the trends in most extreme dry season within a census interval ( MCWD i). The black line represents OLS linear regression, and in the 1:1 line is shown in grey. Note that changes in the tree community are correlated to changes in climate (Kendall τ = −0.2; p &lt; 0.01), so that stronger drying trends favour the mortality of wet‐affiliated taxa. Correlations hold when outliers are removed (Kendall τ = −0.4; p &lt; 0.05 when excluding outliers where climate trend &gt;5 mm/year and trends in losses &gt;10 mm/year) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] </caption>
