<p>We investigate the trends in functional and floristic composition of tree communities by analysing long‐term data from permanent tree inventory plots in the Amazon and adjacent lowland forests (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). A total of 106 South American forest plots from the RAINFOR network (Malhi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>), accessed via the ForestPlots.net repository (Lopez‐Gonzalez, Lewis, Burkitt, &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), met our criteria: (a) sampling lowland (&lt;1,000 m.a.s.l), 
 <italic>terra firme,</italic> intact, moist forests (i.e. where mean maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD) over the last century is less negative than −300 mm/year); (b) having been monitored throughout the period of the two intense dry seasons in 2005 and 2010 (see 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref> for analyses including plots that were not monitored during 2005 and 2010); (c) having had regular monitoring, thus excluding any plots where census interval lengths differed by more than 10 years; (d) having at least 80% of tree stems identified at least to genus level. The selected plots have a mean area of 1.25 ha (95% CI = 1.16, 1.35), and have been re‐censused on average seven times, with a mean census interval of 2.8 years.
