<p>The long‐term plots were monitored following a standardized protocol (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Full methodological details are given elsewhere (Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In brief, all trees and palms ≥10 cm diameter (D) at 1.3 m (or above‐buttress) are tagged, identified to the species level (when possible), have their D measured, and the point of measurement marked and recorded. At every census, trees previously recorded are re‐measured, and new recruits—that is trees that have newly attained 10 cm when the plot is revisited—tagged, measured and identified, and notes are taken about the individuals that died between censuses. Lianas and nonwoody freestanding plants (
 <italic>Phenakospermum</italic>) are excluded from our analyses.
