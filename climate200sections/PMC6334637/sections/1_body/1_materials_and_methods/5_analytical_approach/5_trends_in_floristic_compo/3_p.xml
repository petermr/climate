<p>An Amazon‐wide slope using each of the methods was calculated for each taxon. The LMM analysis was restricted to genera that occurred in three or more plots. As for the functional analyses, each plot in the bootstrap mean following Equation 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-disp-0005" ref-type="disp-formula">(5)</xref> was weighted by the square root of plot area multiplied by the monitoring period and no weighting procedure was applied for the LMM approach (Equation  6). Trends in abundance were also calculated for families and species (Supporting Information Appendix
