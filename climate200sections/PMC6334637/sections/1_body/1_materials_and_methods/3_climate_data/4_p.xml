<p>In addition to estimating annual MCWD, following Feldpausch et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), we also estimated the intensity of the most extreme dry season between two consecutive censuses, hereafter termed MCWD
 <sub>i</sub>. This metric represents a measure of maximum environmental disruption between two censuses, that is the most negative value of annual MCWD between each successive pair of censuses. Only complete years were considered for this calculation. For the first census of each plot, the MCWD
 <sub>i</sub> was calculated as the most negative MCWD values within the 3‐year period preceding that census. This time window is equivalent to the mean census interval within the data (2.8 years).
