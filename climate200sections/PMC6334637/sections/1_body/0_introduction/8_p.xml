<p>Given the uncertainty about how tree size relates to responses to a drying climate, the geographic distributions of species over precipitation gradients offer an alternative source of information with which to predict and to infer the effects of drought on floristic composition. The spatial distribution of tree taxa over precipitation gradients has been shown to provide a valuable proxy for drought tolerance in observational studies and experiments (Engelbrecht et al.,

If drought is increasingly affecting Amazonian forests, we might therefore expect concerted shifts in tree communities towards more dry‐affiliated components. A compositional shift towards more dry‐tolerant taxa as a consequence of an increase in moisture stress has been reported locally for sites in southern Ghana (Fauset et al.,
