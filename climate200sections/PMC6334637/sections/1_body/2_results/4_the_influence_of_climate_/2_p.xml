<p>The trends in the intensity of extreme dry events (MCWD
 <sub>i</sub>) within each plot were significantly correlated with trends in the losses of community basal‐area WDA (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and the fluxes of basal area WDA (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). This indicates that the mortality of large wet‐affiliated trees has increased in plots where the dry seasons have become more extreme. Trends in climate were also negatively correlated to losses of stem‐based WD (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>). There was no significant correlation between trends in climate and trends in community weighted mean of any other trait or segments of the tree community (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>).
