<p>Among the trees that died within the study period (losses), basal area‐weighted wood density (WD) decreased by 1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> g cm
 <sup>−3</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup> or 0.16% per year in the LMM analyses (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). This trend, however, was only observed for 53 of 102 communities, meaning that positive and negative slopes are equally likely to be observed (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.8, two tail binomial test) and, it was not significant when using bootstrapped means (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). No equivalent significant abundance‐based trend for losses in WD terms was observed (Table
