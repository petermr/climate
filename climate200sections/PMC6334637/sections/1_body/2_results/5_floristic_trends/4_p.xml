<p>Our analyses of the trends in abundance for the functional types defined for Amazonian trees by Fyllas et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) show small‐statured nonpioneer taxa to be significantly decreasing in abundance by 0.29% per year (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). No significant trend was found for the other functional types (small‐statured pioneers, tall pioneers and tall nonpioneers). Note that this analysis was limited to the species classified by Fyllas et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) within these four functional types, which represent ca. 28% of the total number of individuals within our plots.
