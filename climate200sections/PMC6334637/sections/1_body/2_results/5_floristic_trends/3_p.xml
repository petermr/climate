<p>By analysing abundance trends of different taxa, it is possible to identify which genera contribute the most to the observed overall changes in functional composition (i.e. PS basal area for the whole community and WDA stem density for recruits). The correlation between taxa PS and their trends in basal area was significant (Kendall 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0.2; 
 <italic>p</italic>‐value &lt; 0.01) and driven by an increase in some emergent and canopy genera such as 
 <italic>Eschweilera</italic>,
 <italic> Licania</italic> and 
 <italic>Pouteria,</italic> and a decrease in some sub‐canopy and understorey genera such as 
 <italic>Iriartea</italic>,
 <italic> Rinorea</italic> and 
 <italic>Oenocarpus</italic> (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). The decrease in WDA within the recruits was also explained by changes in floristic composition across the Amazon (Kendall 
 <italic>τ</italic> = −0.16; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with declines in the recruitment of new stems of wet affiliated Amazon genera such as 
 <italic>Mabea, Sterculia, Swartzia, Iryanthera</italic> and 
 <italic>Theobroma</italic> and recruitment increases for dry affiliates such as 
 <italic>Trema, Simarouba</italic> and 
 <italic>Hieronyma</italic> (Supporting Information Appendix
