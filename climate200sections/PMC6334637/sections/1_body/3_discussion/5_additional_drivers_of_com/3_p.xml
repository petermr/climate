<p>While considerable interest has focussed on the atmospheric and climatic changes, particularly drought, other environmental changes may be important. Conceivably one or more of these could have pervasive impacts on mature forests across the basin to rival or exceed any climate impacts. Amazonian forests have been hypothesized to be recovering from previous disturbances that are either natural (Chambers et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Van Der Sande et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) or human‐driven, particularly in pre‐Colombian times (McMichael, Matthews‐Bird, Farfan‐Rios, &amp; Feeley, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). If this is the case, we would expect the forest to be following a successional trajectory characterized by a shift from pioneers (low wood density) to mature forest species (high wood density; e.g. Chave et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Connell &amp; Slatyer, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>; Lewis, Lloyd, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). While the observed relative increase in basal area of larger taxa is consistent with widespread recovery from disturbance (Chave et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Wright, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0114" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), the 106 Amazonian inventory plots show no significant shift in wood density (WD) across the whole community, or perhaps more importantly, among the recruits (Tables 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We note that our WD data (Chave et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Zanne et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) provide a less than perfect insight into actual change given that there is likely to be additional spatial and intra‐generic variation (Baraloto et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Patiño et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) that we cannot account for. However, WD is considerably conserved across the phylogeny, and genus‐level wood density has been found to be adequate to distinguish between late successional and pioneer genera (Coelho de Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Moreover, the only functional group that has clearly 
 <italic>lost</italic> ground over our monitoring window are the short‐statured nonpioneers—the best suited trees to late‐successional environments (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>). Compositional analyses further suggest that some pioneers are increasing, most notably an increase of 3.4% ha
 <sup>−1 </sup>year
 <sup>−1</sup> in the relative abundance of 
 <italic>Cecropia</italic>, a key early successional taxon (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>), which typically dominates in early stages of succession but declines at later stages of the successional trajectory (Zalamea et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The increase in the abundance of light‐demanding taxa may be a consequence of an acceleration in the canopy gap dynamics caused by the increase in baseline mortality rates (Baker et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Finally, if these forest plots are recovering from the impact of Amazonian peoples who favoured especially useful species, then we might expect domesticated taxa sensu Levis et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) to now be decreasing in abundance following the relaxation of this anthropogenic influence. No such trend is observed in our data (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11</xref>).
