<p>Changes in tree communities are expected to substantially lag behind environmental changes as trees are sessile and long‐lived (Blonder et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Our results are consistent with this prediction. In other systems where climate gradients are almost unidirectional, it is possible to assess the speed at which communities are expected to be moving across spaces to follow climate (Devictor et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), but this is not the case for precipitation in Amazonia where precipitation regime is heterogeneous at multiple spatial scales. However, by ensuring that climate and water‐deficit affiliation are calculated in the same scale we can compare the degree to which climate and communities are changing. Across Amazonia, plots have undergone an average drying trend of −1.1 mm/year MCWD (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Notably, change in tree communities did not keep pace with the change in climate—the mean trend in water‐deficit affiliation for the whole community is two orders of magnitude smaller (0.01 mm/year, Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with confidence intervals overlapping zero. However, a much shorter lag is observed when analysing the net fluxes, that is recruits−deaths (−0.45 mm/year, Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), indicating that although responses are slow, this system has some dynamic capacity to respond to changes in climate.
