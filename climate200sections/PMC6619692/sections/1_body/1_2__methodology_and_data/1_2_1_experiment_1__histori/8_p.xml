<p>The normalized data have a range of 0 to 1 with 1 representing the highest level of vulnerability. In cases where after normalization the sub-index shows an inverse association i.e. 1 representing the lowest level of vulnerability, the data are transformed by subtracting the normalized sub-index from 1. The socioeconomic sub-indices such as education, longevity and GDP were transformed. The CVS is then formulated using equal weightings for the two sub-indices.</p>
