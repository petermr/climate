<p>In the second formulation of CVS, a climate sub-index is included. The three indicators comprising the sub-index are maximum 1 day rainfall, maximum 5 day rainfall and days above 10 mm. Historical daily rainfall data are sourced from a meteorological station in each of the 12 countries. It is important to note that only one station per country is used in this study. Whereas for some smaller islands the station may be representative of general conditions across the entire country, it is recognized that for the larger territories it is likely not. We discuss this limitation further in the discussion section but note here that (i) data limitations restrict creating country-scale indices for all the considered territories at this time, and (ii) the aim is to show the relative influence of including sub-regional variation in climate indices, which is still facilitated using the station data.</p>
