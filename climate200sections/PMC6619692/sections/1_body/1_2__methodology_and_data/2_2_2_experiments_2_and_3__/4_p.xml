<p>In Experiment 3, future vulnerability scores are obtained by considering both future climate and future demographic data with the socioeconomic indicator held constant. The future demographic data are obtained online through the publicly available interactive Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) web-database at

The SSP3 was selected because of its equivalence to the SRES A2. SSP3 describes a world dominated by regional rivalry and shares many scenario characteristics with the fragmented world of SRES A2 [

The data are obtained for the years 2030 and 2050. The database provided data for the population but not the population density hence the population density was calculated by dividing the population total by the country size in square kilometres. The future demographic indicators are normalized and combined with the normalized future climate and constant socioeconomic sub-index to produce future vulnerability scores for the 8 countries.
