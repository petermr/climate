<p>Near term (2030s) and medium term (2050s) intense rain sub-indices are created for each station. The rain sub-index for each future period and for each location is created by calculating the arithmetic mean of the normalized future extreme rain indicators i.e. RX1, RX5 and R10. To determine future values of a rain indicator, a change factor is added to the historical indicator value (originally averaged over 2006–2011). Change factors are obtained from analyses of daily rainfall projected for 1961–2099 under the A2 and B2 emissions scenarios for each station using Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) [
