<p>The final analyses examine the sensitivity of the results to the weightings used. This is examined for the changing climate under the A2 scenario for the mid-century with constant demographic and socioeconomic data. The weightings of 25%, 40% and 35% are assigned to exposure to intense rain events, demographic structure and socio-economic wellbeing respectively. The results are then compared with results from Experiment 2 which is identically premised but with equal weightings. The weightings are premised on the study of [
