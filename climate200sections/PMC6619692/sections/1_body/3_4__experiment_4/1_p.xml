<p>Weightings are applied to the formulation of CVS and rankings re-calculated for the scenario of changing climate and constant demographic and socioeconomic sub-indices for the A2 and B2 scenarios. The aim is to investigate the sensitivity of the analyses to the weighting used.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219250.s005">S5 Appendix</xref> show the results of these investigations. In terms of suggested overall vulnerability, locations in Jamaica, Guyana and Belize are identified as most vulnerable by the 2030s under the A2. For the 2030s B2 analyses and for all scenarios by the 2050s, the same locations are identified as the most vulnerable but with a different order. For example, under the A2 by the 2050s Guyana and Belize are jointly the most vulnerable with Jamaica following. Under the B2 by the 2050s, the order of decreasing vulnerability is Jamaica, Belize and Guyana. It is noted that this latter order is also suggested for equal weighting, under the B2 for the 2030s and 2050s. Antigua is identified as the least vulnerable across all scenarios, formulations and timelines. Other countries in the three lowest vulnerability rankings were Cuba and Bahamas for the weighted approach across all scenarios and timelines. Recall that for equal weighting Grenada, Cuba, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Bahamas were interchangeably among the locations identified as least vulnerable across scenarios and timeline. The suggestion is that for the most and least vulnerable, there was some insensitivity to the weightings applied in this study. However for most countries examined, scenario, index formulation and the timeline considered are all factors that can influence the rank of locations with respect to their suggested vulnerabilities.
