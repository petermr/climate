<p>The normalized future climate sub-index values are obtained from future RX1, RX5 and R10 values (i.e. observed values + change factors) under the A2 and B2 scenarios for the 2030s and 2050s. Values for the 2050s are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g007">Fig 7</xref>. The future sub-index values provide some initial insights into comparative vulnerabilities across the 12 countries with respect to future intense rain events only (i.e. not considering demographics or socio-economic sub-indices). Under the A2 scenario, locations most vulnerable to intense rains are Jamaica, Guyana and Belize for the 2030s in order of decreasing vulnerability. However by the 2050s, though the locations in Belize and Guyana are still identified as the most vulnerable, only Guyana retains its rank. The location in Trinidad is now identified as the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> most vulnerable of the 12 countries. In fact the relative vulnerabilities suggested for 8 of the locations change between the 2030s and 2050s and only the locations in the Guyana (2
 <sup>nd</sup>), Cuba (6
 <sup>th</sup>), Bahamas (7
 <sup>th</sup>) and St. Lucia (10
 <sup>th</sup>) retain their relative rank. Under the B2 scenario, the climate sub-index deduced for the 2030s suggest that Belize, Dominican Republic and Jamaica are most vulnerable. These results may be viewed against the historical analysis where Jamaica, Belize and Dominican Republic are identified as the most vulnerable (see again Section 3.1). The indication then is that the emission scenario and time horizon are important factors when the comparative vulnerabilities of Caribbean countries are examined in the context of future changes in climate.
