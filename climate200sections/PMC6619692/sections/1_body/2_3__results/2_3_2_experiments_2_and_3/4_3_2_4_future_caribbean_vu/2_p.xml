<p>In Experiment 2, the future climate sub-indices are incorporated in the CVS to analyze future comparative vulnerabilities assuming that socioeconomic and demographic factors are unchanged. Under this scenario, locations in Jamaica, Guyana and Belize are identified as most vulnerable across A2 and B2 analyses for the 2030s and 2050s but with the order of these 3 countries changing depending on time horizon and emissions scenario (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g008">Fig 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219250.s003">S3 Appendix</xref>). Similarly, Antigua is consistently identified as the least vulnerable across all scenarios and timelines. Only Dominican Republic retains it rank (4
 <sup>th</sup>) across all scenarios and timelines. The suggestion is that the most and least vulnerable locations across the Caribbean remain so through the medium term, if changes in climate are the only consideration. Otherwise, however, relative ranking is dependent on timeline and emissions scenario being considered.
