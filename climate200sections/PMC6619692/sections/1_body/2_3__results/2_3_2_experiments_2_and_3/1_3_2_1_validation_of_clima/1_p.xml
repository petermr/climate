<p>Future vulnerability is initially examined using rainfall projections from statistical models created in SDSM. 
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the model predictors of daily rainfall for each station. The modelsâ€™ outputs and their derived extreme indices are validated as detailed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Biases of the average annual values of the maximum 1 day rainfall (RX1), 5 day rainfall (RX5) and days above 10 mm (R10) relative to station observations for the 12 stations used in this study are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g006">Fig 6</xref>. The models underestimate the extreme indices by up to approximately 110 mm and 163 mm for RX1 and RX5 respectively. R10 is overestimated over Dominican Republic (1 day), Belize (16 days), Guyana (19 days) and Trinidad (26 days) and underestimated over the other Caribbean locations by up to 22 days. Positive and significant correlations between the modelled versus observed values of R10 are obtained for most stations ranging from 0.28 to 0.71 (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219250.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Exceptions are St. Lucia (-0.14), St. Vincent (-0.04) and Trinidad (0.02). Significant and positive correlations are obtained for RX1 and RX5 only for Jamaica, Cuba, Antigua and Dominican Republic i.e. largely over northern locations. In general, though biases exist in representing the extreme indicators, there is reasonable representation of the average annual variability by the statistical models for some locations, particularly those in the northern Caribbean.
