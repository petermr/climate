<p>Heavy rain events which occur over relatively short periods (sometimes associated with hurricanes and tropical storms but many times not), are a particular challenge for Caribbean territories. Events can occur yearly and repeatedly in a single year with far reaching impact (see for example 
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for Jamaica). To explore how exposure to heavy rainfall extremes may influence comparative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean we define a simple index of vulnerability premised firstly on sub-indices representing socioeconomic well-being and demographic structure for 12 countries (see Section 2). The impact made on the relative rankings of vulnerability when climate sub-indices representing heavy rainfall events are also included in the simple index is then examined. (This analysis is hereafter referred to as Experiment 1). The index comprising the socio-economic, demographic and climate sub-indices is called the Caribbean Vulnerability Score (CVS). The formulation of CVS is further discussed in Section 2 (Methodology) and its potential significance as an indicator of vulnerability is discussed in Section 5.
