<p>Notably a limitation of the current study is the absence of projections of socio-economic inputs in examining future vulnerabilities. As these datasets become available at the national and subnational levels the scope for undertaking similar investigations will increase. Additionally, it is recognized that the rainfall sub-indices used in formulation of the CVS are for one station in each country (many times the airport station) as for most countries examined this was the best and/or only daily data available. There is, then, an assumption that, especially for the smaller islands, the conditions that lead to repeated days of extreme rainfall are generally felt country-wide and result from larger-scale climatic phenomenon and are not so much topographically driven. With a renewed Caribbean drive to capture more and better data on sub-daily time-scales for each territory [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], future similar work will be able to utilize a climate index with greater country-scale representation. The formulation of the CVS also includes indictors that have associated limitations and may be open to other interpretations. For example, while a country may have a relatively lower population density which this study (following other reports) suggests is indicative of a relatively lower vulnerability, a context of the actual location of this population, for example, within 2 m of the coast would suggest a higher vulnerability. There is need therefore to continue to refine this work to obtain indices that are as representative to local circumstances as possible. Additionally some of the results for the vulnerabilities suggested by individual sub-indices and the CVS are worthy of further interrogation. For example this study suggests that with respect to the socio-economic sub-index the location in Cuba is among the least vulnerable given that its longevity is the highest in the selection of countries under investigation and its gross domestic product growth rate is second highest but is offset by its lower rank (7
 <sup>th</sup>) for the gross enrolment ratio, secondary for both sexes.
