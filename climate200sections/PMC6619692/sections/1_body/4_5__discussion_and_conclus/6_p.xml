<p>In the study, the 2030s and 2050s periods overlap with the periods where respective global warming targets of 1.5° and 2.0°C above pre-industrial temperatures are expected to be attained [

This study, suggests that even amidst generally high risk for the entire region, the potential impacts on individual territories will not necessarily be uniform with some SIDS having disproportionate impact. There may therefore be need to further tease out the relative vulnerabilities of different territories at these future warming levels, with the possibility to do so offered by aggregate vulnerability indices like CVS.
