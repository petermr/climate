  <p>Intra-regional variations in climate matter in the determination of comparative vulnerabilities for Caribbean countries. The results of Experiment 1 suggest differences in ranking when climate is explicitly considered as a variable in determining the relative vulnerabilities. In a number of instances vulnerability increased for the CVS calculated with (versus without) a climate sub-index. For example, there were shifts in ranks for Belize (4
   <sup>th</sup> to 2
   <sup>nd</sup>), Dominican Republic (6
   <sup>th</sup> to 4
   <sup>th</sup>), St. Vincent (8
   <sup>th</sup> to 6
   <sup>th</sup>), Trinidad (11
   <sup>th</sup> to 7
   <sup>th</sup>) and Cuba (12
   <sup>th</sup> to 8
   <sup>th</sup>). Interestingly, the particular climate extremes indicator used in this study (for heavy rainfall) appears to be a dominant influence on the suggested relative vulnerabilities for the present-day, for the CVS formulation.

  <p>Care must be taken when determining future vulnerabilities under a changing climate, as except for the most and least vulnerable, rankings shift dependent on scenario examined and time slice considered. This was generally true for Experiments 2 and 3 which respectively considered changing climate only (demographic and socioeconomic indices held constant), and changing climate and demographics (socioeconomic conditions held constant). The relative insensitivity of the most and least vulnerable was, however, noteworthy. For example, the locations in Jamaica and Guyana are consistently identified as among the most vulnerable for the 2030s and 2050s and in the historical analyses. This may suggest that future shifts in climate up to the medium term should be closely monitored by those already displaying extreme sensitivity and targeted actions taken to mitigate against this extreme sensitivity.</p>

  <p>Changing the weightings used in the CVS formulation influenced the relative rankings of locations, but there was also some level of consistency in the countries identified as most and least vulnerable. In Experiment 4, except for Jamaica, Guyana and Belize which were identified as most vulnerable, and Antigua which emerged as least vulnerable, rankings changed dependent on scenario, timelines and weightings used.</p>
