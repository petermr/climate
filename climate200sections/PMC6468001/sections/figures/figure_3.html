 <caption> Learning over time using virtual observations. a– d One sample realization of Bayesian learning over time in which precipitation increases strongly. Black dots represent a time series of virtual climate observations. Shaded regions indicate the projected 90% CI, updated with each time period’s virtual observation. Virtual observations of T ( a) and P ( b) are used to simulate MAR ( c), and water shortages assuming 80 MCM dam capacity ( d). e, h As in a– d but for an alternative realization of virtual observations, showing modest decrease in P </caption>
