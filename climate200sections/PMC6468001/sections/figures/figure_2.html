 <caption> Bayesian and democratic confidence intervals from GCM projections. a and b Modeled and observed temperature (precipitation) relative to 1990 values with uncertainty estimates. Thin gray lines are 20-year moving averages of GCM simulations over Mombasa. Thick black lines show the corresponding historical observed values. Orange (blue) shaded regions show the 90% CIs using the IPCC democratic weighting method (i.e. ±1.64* σ). Yellow (green) shaded regions show the 90% CI developed using the Bayesian uncertainty method applied to historical regional observations before 1990 </caption>
