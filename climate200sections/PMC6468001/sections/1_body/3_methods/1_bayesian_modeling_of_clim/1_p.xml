 </sup> (hereafter called previous Bayesian model) to characterize the SDP transition probabilities. Previous work shows that the uncertainty in climate projections due to natural variability remains relatively constant throughout the 21st century, but that as the climate signal emerges from the noise, the uncertainty in projections is dominated by the GCMsâ€™ climate sensitivity, and hence structure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. We therefore limit our focus to uncertainty in model structure rather than emissions or stochasticity because, first, structural uncertainty dominates long-term precipitation uncertainty
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> and, second, to utilize recent statistical methods for characterizing structural climate uncertainty
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. The previous Bayesian model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> uses ensembles of projections from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> to derive a single distribution describing uncertainty in climate change. Following the previous Bayesian model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, we use historical observations or virtual observations to estimate the reliability of each model run and therefore its weight in the resulting probability distribution. This is in contrast to the democratic approach
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> which each model projection is assumed equally likely and the multi-model mean and standard deviation is used to derive a single probability distribution.
