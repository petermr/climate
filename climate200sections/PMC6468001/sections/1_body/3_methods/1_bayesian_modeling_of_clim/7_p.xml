<p id="Par28">This approach does have limitations. First, it assumes that GCMs are independent of one another, when in fact some models borrow entire components from other models

 </sup>. Second, we assume that a GCM’s ability to reproduce Δ
 <italic>T</italic> or %Δ
 <italic>P</italic> is a better indication of model performance than another metric, such as model variability. Third, we assume that change in time 
 <italic>t</italic> depends on 
 <italic>t−</italic>1 and not previous time periods. Additionally, we assume climate models will not change in the future; repeating the analysis in 40 years with a broader range of models reflecting the new state of the science may produce larger shifts in CIs. However, this approach is the best available to estimate learning in the future, which impacts planning decisions today. It enables a more precise measure of uncertainty in comparison to the democratic approach used by the IPCC; it has also been statistically validated using a cross validation approach
