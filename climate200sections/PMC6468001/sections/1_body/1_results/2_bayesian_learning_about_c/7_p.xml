<p id="Par18">Finally, while the previous analysis has relied on a top-down analysis that uses GCM projections to develop probabilistic forecast, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> presents an illustrative bottom-up analysis that demonstrates the average cost and regret of each of the three dam alternatives in planning scenario A under different end-of-century climates without relying on probabilistic forecasts. Regret is defined as the difference between the cost of the chosen infrastructure alternative and the best possible infrastructure alternative in a given climate state. Three illustrative climates are chosen to demonstrate the tradeoffs across alternatives: a dry climate of 68 mm month
 <sup>−1</sup>, an moderate climate of 78 mm month
 <sup>−1</sup>, and a wet climate of 88 mm month
 <sup>−1</sup>. Differences in 
 <italic>T</italic> are not considered because its impact on water shortages is limited. The small dam without expansion has the highest maximum regret of any alternative of M$77, incurred in the dry climate. The large dam incurs positive regret in both the moderate and wet climates, with the latter incurring M$19 of regret. The flexible dam has the lowest maximum regret, with a modest M$4 of regret in the dry climate. This bottom up approach also highlights the ability of the flexible dam design and expansion strategy to mitigate risk in a range of different potential future climates.
