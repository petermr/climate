<p id="Par13">While Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents Bayesian CIs based on historical observations, the SDP transition probabilities require Bayesian uncertainty estimates that reflect what will have been learned for many possible virtual future observations. We assume that precipitation change will range between −30% and +30% by end of century; we discretize this range at 2% for a total of 31 unique virtual precipitation change observations. We apply the Bayesian uncertainty analysis to each of these 31 virtual precipitation change observations in each time period. For example, two sample time series of virtual 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> observations and their corresponding updated uncertainty estimates are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. An example of strongly increasing 
 <italic>P</italic> is shown at top; an example of modestly decreasing 
 <italic>P</italic> is at bottom. For each virtual observation, we simulate 10,000 virtual climate time series from the current observation to the end of the planning period and construct a 90% CI, shown by the shaded regions. This process is repeated for each time step, with darker colors in the plot corresponding to the CIs developed from virtual observations sampled later in the planning period. The darker CIs therefore reflect uncertainty estimates updated with information farther into the future. The sample of virtual observations showing strong increases in 
 <italic>P</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>), leads to high certainty by the end of the century that negligible water shortages will be incurred, assuming the small 80 MCM of dam capacity. Strong asymmetric uncertainty reflects the low-probability, high-severity risk of droughts; shortages occur only when runoff is substantially below MAR for several months. The alternate sample of virtual observations showing modest decreases in 
 <italic>P</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e–h</xref>) demonstrates a reduction in uncertainty in both 
 <italic>P</italic> and MAR. Expected water shortages increase substantially as more observations are collected, and the uncertainty increases as well due to non-linear relationships between MAR and shortages.
