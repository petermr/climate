<p id="Par14">While two sample time series of observations are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the SDP optimal strategy accounts for a wide range of possible future observations and what would be learned if they were to be observed. This is achieved through the multistage stochastic optimization formulation, which allows for uncertain, rather than deterministic, transitions to new climate states in each period. In the first time period, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the SDP develops a threshold as a function of 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> during the 2001–2020 time period when the initial infrastructure decision is made. Above the threshold, in hotter and drier climates, the large dam is optimal and below it the flexible dam is. Due to the small cost difference between the flexible and large dam, investing in the large dam option upfront is preferred if the risk of shortages at the outset is high enough. This reduces expected costs by leveraging economies of scale. Panel b shows expansion thresholds for time periods 2–5 for the flexible dam. Expanding infrastructure capacity is optimal in drier and warmer states. In the 2041–2060 time period, the policy threshold shifts right, reflecting the narrowing of uncertainty due to additional information in later time periods. In later time periods, however, it shifts left, reflecting the influence of the end of the planning horizon which disincentivizes investment.
