 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows infrastructure decisions under the optimal policy across 1000 simulated climate time series. In planning scenario A, the flexible alternative is chosen in 90% of simulations, shown in panel a. When the flexible alternative is chosen, the option to expand is never chosen in about 90% of simulations. This highlights the low probability of reaching a climate dry enough to generate shortages beyond 10% of demand. The time period at which expansion is exercised varies; more rapid warming and drying leads to earlier expansion. Panel b shows cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the total cost (including shortage damages) of each alternative across the 1000 simulations under planning scenario A. The large static alternative has the same cost across simulations; as designed, no shortage damages are incurred in any feasible climate. The small dam performs better than the large dam in about 70% of simulations, but has substantially higher costs in 30% of simulations due to large damages from water shortages. The flexible dam mirrors the small dam in 70% of simulations, but the reliability risk is substantially mitigated because of the potential to expand. The high-end costs are higher than the large dam because, first, the cost of building the 80 MCM dam and expanding to 120 MCM is higher than building the 120 MCM dam upfront and, second, sometimes the dam is not expanded even when modest water shortages are incurred. The ability of the flexible alternative to mitigate both the risk of overbuilding and the risk of severe shortages demonstrates the high value of flexibility in this case.
