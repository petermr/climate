<p id="Par16">The value of flexibility changes under planning scenarios B (no discounting; panels c and d) and C (high demand with desalination plant; panels e and f). Without discounting, the large dam is more favorable; it performs best in 60% of simulations, has no cost variability risk, and is chosen in 80% of simulations. Large economies of scale in the dam mean that a 120 MCM dam is only 30% more expensive than an 80 MCM dam for 50% additional capacity. This suggests it is often better to build the large dam upfront even if there is a relatively low probability that it will be needed. Scenario C evaluates a 120 MCM dam combined with a desalination plant. We find a high value of flexibility even without discounting. The flexible alternative is chosen upfront in over 80% of forward simulations. The CDF demonstrates that it outperforms the static alternatives by substantially mitigating the over build risk in comparison to the robust alternative. The flexible alternative also modestly reduces the shortage damage risk in comparison to the small alternative. While the flexible alternative only reduces cost at the 90th percentile and above, this substantially reduces the expected value as the maximum cost of the small plant reaches almost M$400.</p>
