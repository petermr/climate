<p id="Par6">We develop a planning framework that explicitly models the potential to learn about climate uncertainty over time and uses potential learning to develop and evaluate flexible planning strategies in comparison to static approaches. First, we use GCM projections to develop a wide range of possible future mean regional temperature (
 <italic>T</italic>) and precipitation (
 <italic>P</italic>) outcomes over a planning horizon. We finely discretize mean annual 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> within that range. This develops a comprehensive set of virtual climate observations of mean 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> that reflect many possible future regional climates, some of which are drier and some of which are wetter. Next, we adapt a Bayesian statistical model

 </sup> to update initial climate uncertainty estimates for each virtual climate observation. The updated estimates reflect what we will have learned if the virtual observation comes to pass. These updated uncertainty estimates characterize the transition probabilities in a non-stationary stochastic dynamic program (SDP); each possible change in SDP climate state is equivalent to a virtual climate observation. This SDP planning formulation therefore takes into account all the potential new information that may be learned in the future as it develops optimal planning policies. We use these polices to evaluate flexible infrastructure planning approaches and compare them to static approaches.
