Flexible planning strategies can substantially reduce the cost of infrastructure investments. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first framework that values the ability of flexible approaches to respond to climate learning, therefore more comprehensively evaluating the tradeoffs of robust and flexible adaptation strategies.
