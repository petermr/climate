 <caption> Climate-related trait dimensions from the redundancy analysis: gray circles are species-site combinations and colored dots signify named regions as defined in Figure 1. The traits are SLA, specific leaf area; N area, leaf nitrogen per unit area; and LAI: leaf area index. The climatic variables are mean annual temperature (MAT), daily precipitation (MAP), and monthly photosynthetically active radiation (mPAR) (in color). </caption>
