<p>This work highlights two challenges for modeling. The first is the “challenge of predictability” – the extent to which trait values can be predicted from independent information, including environmental factors and/or others. Recent research has mainly focused on the prediction of community-mean trait values. In fact, some trait variation, even in such a climatically wide-ranging data set, is not predictable by climate alone, and some other factors, such as site microclimate, life form, and family (phylogeny), are also important contributors to the trait variations (
