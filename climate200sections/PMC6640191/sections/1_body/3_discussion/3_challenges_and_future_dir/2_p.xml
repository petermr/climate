<p>The second modeling challenge is the “challenge of functional diversity.” Trait-based models can represent the co-existence of multiple trait combinations. Moreover, this diversity confers increased resilience in model communities in the face of environmental change (

The challenge is to find a generally applicable method to specify the range of allowable trait combinations that is consistent with observed patterns of trait variation within sites. Ultimately, vegetation models should be able to predict, for example, experimentally determined relationships between species diversity and ecosystem function (e.g.,
