<p>For future climates, a set of scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) have been widely adopted by climate and ecology researchers to provide a range of possible futures for analyzing vegetation dynamics (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). RCPs were used for new climate model simulations under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) of the World Climate Research Programme (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al., 2010</xref>), and the projected global mean surface temperature increases range from 1.5°C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs (RCP3-PD and RCP2.6) to 4.5°C for the highest one (RCP8.5) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen et al., 2011</xref>). The lowest, medium and highest RCPs, namely RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 respectively, were selected in this study (
