<p>Climate was one of most important drivers of trait variations (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), and trait values were always considered to filter the results of climate changes (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2010</xref>). Compared with single trait variations, trait covariation showed a trade-off among traits under changing climatic conditions. On the one hand, trait covariations determined the ecosystem structure and function of ecosystems, which would provide more credible parameters for the ecosystem processes than the fixed ones, on the other hand, trait covariation can simultaneously provide reasonable ranges for each vegetation type, which would help us to classify the trait combinations into different vegetation types using trained GMM.
