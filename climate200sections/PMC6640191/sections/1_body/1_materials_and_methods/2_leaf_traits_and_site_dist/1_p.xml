<p>We selected two plant functional traits [SLA (m
 <sup>2</sup>/kg) and 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>area</sub> (g/m
 <sup>2</sup>)] and one structural trait of plant communities (LAI) in this study. From 2003 to 2013, we collected 1,192 functional trait observations from 580 species across 218 sites (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), which occupied the main climate space in China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and the dominate species in the sampling sites were selected. The sampling sites could be classified into seven main regions. The northernmost region was Mohe and the main vegetation types was boreal forest. Sites from Changbai to Inner Mongolia were distributed across an aridity gradient (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Prentice et al., 2011</xref>). Sites from Inner Mongolia were distributed along the 400 mm equivalent precipitation line (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2017</xref>). The northwestern sites were distributed in Mount Altai and Mount Tian in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. The southwestern sites were located in Xishuangbanna (XSBN) and the main vegetation types are subtropical and tropical forests.
