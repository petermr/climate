<p>The annual mean precipitation did not differ greatly among the four climate models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The annual mean precipitation was 611 mm under RCP2.6, 626 mm under RCP4.5, and 648 mm under RCP8.5. Under the three climatic scenarios, NorESM1-M had the highest annual mean precipitation, followed by MPI-ESM-MR and IPSL-CM5A-MR. The annual mean precipitation increased from 2006 to 2040 and remained relatively stable during 2041â€“2100. For precipitation, mPAR was relatively stable from 2006 to 2020 and then quickly increased from 2020 to 2030 before finally stabilizing at a relatively high level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, NorESM1-M presented the highest mPAR, followed by MPI-ESM-MR and CanESM2. Under RCP8.5, IPSL-CM5A-MR had the highest mPAR, followed by MPI-ESM-MR and NorESM1-M.
