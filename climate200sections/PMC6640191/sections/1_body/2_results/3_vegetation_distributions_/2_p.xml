<p>Vegetation exhibits differently responses to climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Under RCP2.6, the area of the tropical forest complex increases in the three periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Compared with the current vegetation distributions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>), the subtropical forest complex also shows an increasing trend during the three periods, although as time passes, the increase weakens. Similar to the temperate forest complex, the area of boreal and alpine forests changes little compared with the historical vegetation distributions. Temperate scrub and temperate steppe decrease slightly with time. Alpine steppe expands north, causing rapid tundra shrinkage.
