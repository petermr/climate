<p>Under RCP8.5, tropical forest shifts north, although its area changes little. From 2076 to 2100, the area of tropical forest increases by nearly 30% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The subtropical forest complex shifts north and always expands rapidly. Temperate forest also expands, but its rate of increase is much lower than that of the tropical forest complex. Boreal forest, which is located in northeastern China, almost disappears in this scenario, although the alpine forest occupies a larger area on the Tibetan Plateau, causing the shrinkage of alpine steppe and tundra.
