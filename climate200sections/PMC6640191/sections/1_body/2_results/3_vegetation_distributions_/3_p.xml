<p>Under RCP4.5, the tropical forest complex shows an obvious deceasing trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and is replaced by the subtropical forest complex. Both the subtropical forest complex and temperate forest shift north show an increasing trend in the area. Boreal forest shrinks as time passes and alpine forest first expands and then decreases in area from 2051 to 2075. Temperate scrub and temperate steppe shrink during all three periods. The area of temperate steppe changes little during the three periods. Similar to the patterns observed under RCP2.6, alpine steppe shifts north, causing tundra to shrink quickly and shift north.
