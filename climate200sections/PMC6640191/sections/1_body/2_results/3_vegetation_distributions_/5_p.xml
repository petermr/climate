<p>Among the three climatic scenarios, the subtropical forest complex, temperate forest and alpine steppe all show an increasing trend, while temperate scrub, temperate steppe and tundra show a decreasing trend. The most obvious increase occurred in the subtropical forest because it is broadly adapted to warm and humid climatic conditions, while tundra is the most sensitive vegetation type under such conditions. The most dramatic changes in vegetation distributions occur under the RCP8.5, for which the average rate of change reaches 25.20%, followed by RCP4.5 (22.10%) and RCP2.6 (16.50%).</p>
