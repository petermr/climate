<p>Vegetation determines the fluxes of energy and water and the variation in CO

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Prentice and Cowling, 2013</xref>) typically use fixed values to distinguish differences in the structure and function of plant functional types (PFTs) and do not permit these traits to vary or adapt in time and space. However, these traits not only vary but also generally show more variation within PFTs than between PFTs (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">van Bodegom et al., 2012</xref>). A growing number of studies have rejected PFT classifications because of their insufficiency in describing continuous variation in traits in nature and its low accuracy in modeling ecological processes (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pavlick et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Ecologists and modelers have attempted to find new methods to improve or replace the PFT framework in DGVMs. One of the most feasible methods is using the relationships between plant functional traits and climate to replace the fixed values of PFTs. Therefore, it is urgent to discuss trait covariation (providing continuous trait variation for ecological processes in the next generation of trait-based DGVM) and the relationships between traits and vegetation types (an important output of trait-based DGVM), especially under future climate scenarios.
