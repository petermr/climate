<p>Indeed, South Africa is rapidly urbanising with an urban population of 62% and a rural population of 38% (Stats SA, Census – 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The urbanisation (i.e. 2.85% average urban population increase in South Africa for the period 1996–2011) and migration trends (i.e. average of 22% for the period 1996–2011) have spatial implications for the provision of rural and urban transport (StatsSA 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Understanding the urbanisation dividend in the context in which rural transport climate change impacts and transitions are presenting new constraints and opportunities for the sector is important. Exploring how rural transport and climate change impacts play out in reality is important in creating action space for interventions. The rural transport and climate change implications discussion is conducted in a context in which the interdependencies between rural and urban areas are acknowledged. The built and non-built environment (in both urban and rural areas) can be viewed as ‘machines’ and ‘tools’ in managing and controlling climate change impacts. Although a green transport strategy (2016–2021) has been developed by the Department of Transport, the downside of the green transport policy is that it inadequately tackles the rural transport and climate change adaptation dimension in South Africa (Department of Transport 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Climate change adaptation with respect to transportation is an urgent matter in South Africa, given that we have rural infrastructure and communities that are already threatened by their situation on unsuitable sites, for example, housing developments on sites vulnerable to flooding or coastal infrastructure below the high water mark (Pinstrup-Andersen &amp; Shimokawa
