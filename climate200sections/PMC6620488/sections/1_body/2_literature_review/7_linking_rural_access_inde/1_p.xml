<p>The SDGs have gone a step further than the Millennium Development Goals in making an explicit provision and recognition of the role that transport plays in development â€“ be it in urban or rural spaces but most importantly in facilitating the realisation of all other SDGs (SLOCAT

The fact that transport-related targets are included explicitly and implicitly in at least a minimum of 7 out of the 17 SDGs illustrates the cross-cutting role that transport has in sustainable development. Sustainable transport is indeed a cross-cutting thematic area and cross-sectional issue that shapes and is shaped by the developmental trajectory of past, present and future generations alike.
