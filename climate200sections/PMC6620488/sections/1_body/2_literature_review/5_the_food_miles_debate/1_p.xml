<p>Climate change within the transport domain has ushered in the emergence of the ‘food miles debate’ (McKinnon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This debate revolves around questioning the ‘transport distance that food products travel from production site to consumption market or food outlet’ (Weber &amp; Matthews 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This is much acute in a global village in which ‘the food plate debate’ is strongly linked to the GHGs emitted as well as the need to raise new social consciousness. The use of air and road transport has added to the complexity in exploring the carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to climate change. Understanding the ‘food miles’ debate is important for South Africa’s rural areas, as climate change transportation implications have a direct bearing on the evolving rural agricultural systems and economies.
