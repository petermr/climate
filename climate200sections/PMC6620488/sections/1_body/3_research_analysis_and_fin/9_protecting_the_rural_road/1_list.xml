   <italic>Protecting the road infrastructure from the impacts of climate changes:</italic> this can be achieved through ensuring that the road infrastructure does not increase the vulnerability of the surrounding area to climate change (Gordon &amp; Sherar 
   <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). At the same time, providing early warnings and emergency management measures is also critical.

   <italic>Improved planning for rural roads to accommodate climate changes:</italic> this can be tackled through preparing vulnerability maps for rural roads as a result of climate change (World Bank 
   <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). At the same time, planning systems and institutions have to undertake improved planning for climate changes.

   <italic>Identifying potential adaptation options:</italic> once these have been identified, these should immediately be prioritised. It is also beneficial to conduct an economic analysis of climate-proofing measures to support the decision-making process (DEA 
   <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).

   <italic>Reviewing the sustainability and capacity of existing rural transportation engineering designs, standards and guidelines:</italic> there is an urgent need to review the current engineering designs, standards and guidelines to withstand climate changes, especially in rural areas, given the sharp twists in climatic regimes (Department of Transport 
   <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The review should be followed by the development and implementation of training and updating of curriculums so that climate and transport adaptation-ready graduates are produced. In terms of the implementation and sustainability of rural transport surfacing options, the need to explore low-cost road surfacing guidelines is important. At the same time, new low-cost road surfacing technologies as indicated by non-technology, for example, should also be explored. Surface options for low-cost roads completion require the following issues to be addressed:

   <italic>Promoting green planning and infrastructure design, implementation and management:</italic> there is a need to design and implement ecosystem-based adaptation strategies that focus on environmental or green planning for rural project roads (McKinnon et al. 
   <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, the planting of climate change resilient trees along project road embankments and select grass and biomaterials to improve flood and drought management (i.e. increasing ground cover and infiltration of floods and water retention during droughts) is essential. This should include the implementation of sustainable engineering infrastructure and services solutions. Such a solution will seek to promote and advance the deployment of environmentally optimised rural transport design standards and specifications.
