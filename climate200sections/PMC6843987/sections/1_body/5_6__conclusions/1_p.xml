<p>This study set out to understand the main features of community flood resilience in urban settings and the common priorities of DRR, CCA, and Development groups in regards to flood resilience building in Jakarta. The findings have important implications for guiding the development of urban flood resilience strategies, particularly in terms of resource allocation and priority settings. This study can help decision-makers to identify the potential partnership glue factors by better understanding the commonalities and differences between the three groups.</p>
