<p>While the literature identifies the importance of human, technical, financial, natural, social, and institutional aspects in efforts to strengthen community flood resilience, the findings from this study reveal that the majority of stakeholders surveyed believed that urban flood resilience building in Jakarta has to be centered upon the human aspect (including the element of a risk-informed society). This paper urges that, for any city with complex environmental and societal problems, like Jakarta, this shift of thinking should be adopted in their flood risk reduction policies, programs, and activities.</p>
