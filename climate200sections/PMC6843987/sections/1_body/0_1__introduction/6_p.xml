<p>While several studies have focused on elaboration of the operational concept of community resilience in different environmental settings or different hazards like earthquake-prone areas, e.g., [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-03993" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], among others, floods in a complex urban setting still need to be studied. Therefore, this study is focused on understanding the operational concepts of flood resilience in an urban community within a complex setting. As a case site, the metropolitan city of Jakarta, Indonesia, which is often termed complex [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03993" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], has been selected for this study. This study is important to improving the evidence base for guiding CCA, DRR, and development practitioners in fine-tuning collaborative actions between stakeholders to build community resilience against flood risks in urban settings.
