<p>Most of the community people who participated in FGD and IDI had a perception of natural disaster and maternal death in their area. However, they perceive that both of the things occur due to destiny/ill-fate, even though floods occur in one season (monsoon) but their effects persists throughout the year in that area. Floods make their life more complicated as there are problems of housing, communication, food, and medical treatment. Their lives become under threat during flooding. Pregnant women and their children are more vulnerable during floods. Maximum maternal death occurs during the disaster period due to difficulty in obtaining treatment and communication. Maternal deaths occur due to complications after delivery to delays in reaching the hospital due to communication and transportation problems. </p>
