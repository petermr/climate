  <italic>Flood occurs every year in rainy season but it was most dangerous in 2014. People couldn’t go out from home. Tube wells and toilets were sub-merged. We stayed on the roof of our houses. We could not cook due to wind and heavy rain. Many children died with diarrhea. Some people died by thunderstorms</italic>”.
