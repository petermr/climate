  <italic>We call kabiraj and village doctor if there is any complication of the pregnant mother during flood. They provide treatment after checkup. We can’t go to the public hospital due to difficulties in transportation. But if the kabiraj and village doctor fail to provide treatment and suggest us to go to the hospital then we try to arrange for transferring the mother which is very difficult. At first, we have to go to Krishnopur bazaar (nearby market place) to arrange a boat for reaching to Samachor (nearest available land with motorable road), then we book the auto-rickshaw or laguna (indigenously makeshift tri-cycle with installed water-pump motor) to reach hospital. The process is very time-consuming and expensive</italic>”.
