<p>General Circulation Models (GCMs) have been applied to evaluate the effect of climate change on a wide region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published the latest sets of scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)) in the its fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. These scenarios include RCP8.5, RCP6, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 [

To link between outputs of GCMs (spatial resolution of 100–300 km) and the local climatic processes (spatial resolution of 10–20 km), downscaling technique was investigated. This technique was applied to project future climate pattern at the local scale under RCP scenarios [
