Artificial neural networks (ANNs), as nonlinear statistical modeling, can be applied for creating models of disease spreading and prediction of epidemic outcomes. Moreover, ANNs can gain elucidation of data and nonlinear forecast analysis of variables for evaluation of biological and environmental data [
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several studies applied ANNs to forecast the incidence of cholera over an area and illustrated advantages and disadvantages of this method [
