<p>Many undeveloped/developing countries such as Iran still suffer from frequent epidemics; therefore, the objectives of present study were evaluation of the association between the cholera cases and climate variables and also finding the most effective parameters. In addition, we developed ANNs to simulate the climate change impact on cholera cases by the year 2050 in Qom, Iran, with the highest cholera incidences, within two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. In considering importance of controlling cholera in Qom, it can help to develop a system for warning incidence of cholera which lead to promotion of planning and decision-making for public health and reducing the health effects of climate change.</p>
