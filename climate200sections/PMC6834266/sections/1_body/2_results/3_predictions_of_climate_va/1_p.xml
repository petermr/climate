<p>Statistical downscaling using LARS-WG was applied to define an empirical relationship between observed regional climatic (1976–2005) and GCM output models for 2021–2050 under two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for the study area. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g005">Fig 5</xref> demonstrates the downscaled monthly mean values of three parameters of precipitation, T
 <sub>max</sub> and T
 <sub>min</sub> under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, compared to the baseline values. As can be seen in this figure, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 predicted that the minimum and maximum temperatures will rise in the study area by the year 2050. The highest increase in T
 <sub>min</sub> and T
 <sub>max</sub> will happen in July (1.44°C) and May (1.81°C) for RCP8.5, respectively. In addition, the lowest amount of precipitation will occur in Mar (-7.89) but in overall, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios predicted that precipitation will decrease in the first 6 months of the year, while it will increase in the three months of winter during October, November and December.
