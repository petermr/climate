<p>Regarding the size of dataset, the near neighbors (the number of Pmax) were estimated in 10 which shows that produces the most accurate estimate. The variation of gamma statistic and the SE versus the Pmax has been illustrated in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g004">Fig 4(B)</xref>, it can be seen that the sufficient data point to construct a smooth data model without overtraining were at least 4000â€“4500.
