<p>The simulation of effect of climate change on cholera disease was carried out by using a feed-forward MLP type of ANNs. The schematic of the optimized NN is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g006">Fig 6</xref>. This figure demonstrates that the network has one hidden layer and Tan Axon and Momentum were set as layerâ€™s transfer function and learning rule, respectively. It is worth to mention that the results are based on data with 21-days lag (21DL). According to the results, the average final MSEs were 0.011 and 0.008 with standard deviations of 0.004 and 0.003, respectively for training and cross-validation.
