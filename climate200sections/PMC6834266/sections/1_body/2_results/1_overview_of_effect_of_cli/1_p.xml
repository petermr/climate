<p>From March 1998 to December 2016, in total, 1243 patients were identified with cholera by the surveillance system in Qom province. The highest number of annual cholera cases were recognized in five years 1998, 2001, 2005, 2008 and 2011 with 836, 22, 167, 26 and 137, respectively, and the other years have few or zero number of cholera cases. The minimum, maximum and mean of monthly variables for each year are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The maximum monthly of cholera was 21 in August 1998, as a year with the highest number of cholera cases. No case was recognized in some years observed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The monthly average of minimum temperature varied between 10.5°C in 2000 and 11.54°C in 2015 which shows an increase for minimum temperature. The lowest temperature was recorded in January 2008 with a monthly average of -23°C after a catastrophic weather in Qom. An increasing trend was observed for monthly average of maximum temperature. So, the maximum temperature was elevated from 43.5°C in August 1998 to 45.2°C in June 2016 and also during 19 years, the highest temperature was recorded in July 2010 with 47°C. The maximum precipitation was varied between 9.5 mm in December 2014 and 35 mm in November 1999. Furthermore, a decreasing trend was observed for precipitation during the years. Time series of cholera and climate variables were applied to demonstrate the relationship between climatic factors and number of cholera cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For better understanding the figure, we presented the monthly values of cholera cases and climate variables in just 5 years with the highest number of choleras and ignored the years with negligible or zero cases of cholera. A seasonal trend in cholera cases and climate variables is shown during 1998 to 2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Highest numbers of cholera were observed during the warm season from June to September with highest maximum and minimum temperature and lowest precipitation. Analysis of the correlation between monthly average of climate variables and number of cholera cases were carried out by Pearson test (
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The maximum and minimum temperatures as independent variables had a positive correlation and also precipitation has a negative correlation with number of cholera cases (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.211, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.204 and R
 <sup>2</sup> = -0.226, respectively). Moreover, the seasonal pattern of cholera disease was confirmed by correlation coefficient of 0.332 between months and the number of cholera cases.
