<p>In the present study, different combinations of input data were explored to assess their influence on the cholera disease. GT evaluated the best combination of the candidate inputs by Genetic Algorothim (GA). The parameters of GA to find good embedding were the population size (100 chromosomes), the mutation rate (0.01), the crossover rate (0.5), the gradient fitness (0.1), intercept fitness (0.8), and length fitness (0.1) [
