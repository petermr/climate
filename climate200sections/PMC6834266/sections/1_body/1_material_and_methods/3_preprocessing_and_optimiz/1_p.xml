<p>The Gamma Test (GT) was known as a non-linear modeling analysis tool which estimated the minimum Mean Square Error (MSE). GT can be attained when modeling the unseen data using any continuous nonlinear models. This tool was firstly introduced by Koncar [

 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and then improved by other researchers [

 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. GT is an index of strength association between two variables measured at the ordinal level. This index estimated that part of variance of output data which cannot be accounted for any smooth data model and calculate by vertical intercept of the regression line [
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, slope or gradient is the slope of regression line and could provide information on complexity of the system. GT is known as a non-parametric method and its results used to build a model regardless of the techniques. The result can standardize by V-ratio, which determines as Gamma/Var (output) and scale between 0 and 1. A V-ratio equal or close to zero demonstrates a high degree of predictability of given output. Furthermore, if the standard error (SE) value tends to zero, there is a high confidence in the value of gamma statistic as an estimate for the noise variance on the output [
 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To estimate the reliability of gamma statistic, a series of GT (for a definite number of unique data points (M)) was run to determine the size of the data set required to create a stable asymptote. The M-test helps us to find out how many data points are adequate for building a model with a proximate MSE to the estimated noise variance (when the M-test plot be-comes flat) [
