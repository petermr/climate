<p>In the first step, five time-series data including cholera's data with no lag time (NL), cholera's data with seven days lag (7DL), cholera's data with 14 days lag (14DL), cholera's data with 21 days lag (21DL) and cholera's data with 30 days lag (30DL) were prepared to be examined. In the next step, standard normalization was applied to give an equal chance to contribute to an output prediction for each data group. Then, different smooth data modeling techniques were built and examined. Three principal factors of GT including gamma statistics, model complexity, and the required number of inputs were used to determine the fitness of particular mask or feature set. Finally, according to the results of GT, GA and M-test, the best lag time was chosen between five time-series.</p>
