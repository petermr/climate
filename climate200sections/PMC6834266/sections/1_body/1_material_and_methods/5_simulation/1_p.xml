<p>The ANNs were applied to simulate the climate change impacts on cholera disease. ANNs is a powerful mechanism and an important computational data-driven model which can learn a correlation between inputs and outputs (training) and then represents the relationship between input and output parameters by building a model. One of the most commonly and effective used types of neural network is Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) approach, i.e. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Using MLP, a learning model created by baseline data and then it uses to produce outputs for new inputs [
