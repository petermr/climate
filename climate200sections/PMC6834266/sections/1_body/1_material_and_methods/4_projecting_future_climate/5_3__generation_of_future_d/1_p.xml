 <bold>3. Generation of future daily synthetic weather data:</bold> LARS-WG baseline parameters which are derived from observed weather data (during the process of model calibration) are applied to generate synthetic weather by using the output of GCMs (as predictors). It derived changes in precipitation and temperature and statistically downscale the conditioning of parameters. The LARS-WG version of 5â€“5 has not covered the latest sets of scenarios which released in the IPCC-AR5. Thus, to produce the RCP scenario fills and generate future weather data, the observed climate data in the study area was compared with the GCM outputs and then applied to the LARS scenario fill.
