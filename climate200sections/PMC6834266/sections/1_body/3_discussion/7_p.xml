<p>According to investigation of Qom Health Center, the main cause of cholera in Qom was determined as consumption of contaminated vegetables and untreated water in suburb. The justification of this phenomena can be found in the summer time. As mentioned, climate in Qom is dry and warm; therefore, lack of precipitation, drought and water shortage in the summer led to increasing bacterial load and contaminate groundwater by waterborne infection,

Irrigation of agricultural products by contaminated water and untreated wastewater and their consumption can transmit

 <italic>cholerae</italic> is the major cause of human diarrheal infection of cholera, which cause economic loss and mortality in developing countries. It is nominated as "the disease of poverty" because it has shown in areas with no access to adequate water treatment systems and sewage collection lines [

As mentioned, Qom is a religious city and hosts lots of tourists from endemic countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan annually. All of these suitable conditions were provided in Qom and it could be resulted intense growth of bacteria and increase incidence rate of cholera infection. Therefore, the promotion of any control measures such as the development of sewage collection lines, the use of treated wastewater for irrigation of farms, monitoring on the production/distribution of foods and raw vegetables can help to reduce the predicted number of cholera incidence by the model in the future.
