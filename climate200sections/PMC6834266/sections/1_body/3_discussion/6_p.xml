<p>The projected scenario’s datasets were utilized on the optimized NN data-driven model to evaluate the future trend of cholera cases. These datasets included daily values of cholera cases and climate variables for 30 years (2021–2050). According to the present results, a slight increase was shown in cholera cases under the two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Our data identified 4–5 years cycles between 2021 and 2050 under the scenario of RCP8.5. In one important study, the ‘cyclical periodicity’ of cholera disease was demonstrated in relation to the cycles of rainfall by the director of public health in Bengal. They reported that insufficient rainfall under drought conditions could lead to epidemics of cholera [

It should be noted that all of the conditions will happen when the authorities do not accomplish any preventive actions and social factors (availability of healthy water especially in suburb and development of wastewater systems) remain either the same or worse during the time. Considering extensive changes in global and local climate conditions in last decades and its impact on the spread of different diseases, it is a great necessity to find proper algorithms to predict the vastness of these diseases based on climate conditions. In this regards, ANNs are known as one of the appropriate tools for climate modeling and weather prediction [
