<p>Our results showed that ANNs is a very useful and executive tool for simulation of infectious diseases such as cholera to perform preventive actions and decrease fatalities and also limit unwanted social results. But, because of some mentioned limitations of our dataset, sensitivity of simulation is not high enough. Therefore, it is important to get comprehensive and influential data including hygienic, social and demographic parameters. These results were obtained based on the present social conditions and surveillance systems. Promotion in surveillance system, increasing in the number of epidemiologic studies and identification of climatic and social risks factors can help to enhance control and prevention interventions.</p>
