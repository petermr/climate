<p>Using MS as a specific feed resource in price and production risk contexts, this study identified potential pathways on poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change–Environmental degradation nexus. Simulation of methane emissions from small-scale farmers’ dairy cattle feeding adaptation strategies suggests that low or non-existent supplementation in MS-based rations is associated with higher-than-average methane emissions. The findings of the study underscore the centrality of hazard vulnerability risk assessment and multisectorial planning in the design of sustainable adaptation frameworks. Accordingly, adaptation frameworks should pay close attention to socio-economic issues, social organisations and institutions as the basis for risk-informed policies in general and for the assessment, prioritisation, monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation actions for the agricultural sector in particular.</p>
