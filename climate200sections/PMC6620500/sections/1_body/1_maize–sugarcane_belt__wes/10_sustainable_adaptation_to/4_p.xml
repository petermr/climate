<p>About 40% of dairy cattle in Kenya are found in semi-intensive farming systems (ILRI 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This feature, coupled with information that these production systems have the highest maize densities, indicates a high potential for benefits from maizeâ€“livestock integration (ILRI 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The changing climatic conditions, particularly rainfall and temperature patterns, portend adverse impacts on the agricultural sector and other socio-economic sectors in Kenya. Current projections indicate that such impacts will worsen in the future if significant reductions in the anthropogenic GHGs emissions that are responsible for climate change are not made (GOK
