<p>Ruminants produce carbon (IV) oxide and methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>). However, carbon (IV) oxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) produced by ruminants, notably cattle, is of less concern because it originates entirely from newly generated biomass and does not contribute to its net rise in the atmosphere. This leaves methane as the gas of concern (Tamminga 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Methane emissions increase climate forcing risks and vulnerability of resource-constrained households to other external shocks. Based on the warming potential, methane emission has higher social costs compared to CO
 <sub>2</sub> (Hope

 <sub>2</sub> on gram per gram basis over a period of 100 years (Tamminga
