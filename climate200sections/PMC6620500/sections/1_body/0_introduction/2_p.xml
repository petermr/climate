<p>Worldwide, wild and domestic ruminants, as a result of metabolic processes (enteric fermentation), produce 15% â€“ 25% of total methane gas emissions, 74% of which is caused by cattle (Tamminga 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Enteric fermentation generates approximately 86 million tonnes of CH
 <sub>4</sub> worldwide (Steinfeld et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Managing methane emissions from ruminants in general, and dairy cattle feeding strategies in particular, is important in climate change mitigation (Volenzo
