<p>Previous studies have postulated several relationships in the analysis of poverty–environmental degradation nexus. In one of the relationships, poverty–environmental degradation nexus is considered in a bidirectional order for policy making purposes, that is, the prioritisation of environmental management or poverty alleviation interventions. It was argued by Dasgupta et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) that irrespective of policy priorities, complementarity between environmental and poverty alleviation strategies should always be pursued. However, there is paucity of research findings on poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus. Existing findings on poverty–environmental degradation nexus can be used in gaining insights into the proposed poverty–price–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus.
