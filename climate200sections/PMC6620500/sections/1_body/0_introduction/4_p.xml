<p>Although there is high uncertainty in the models used to estimate social costs from emissions, the social cost of CH
 <sub>4</sub> is estimated to grow 50% faster per year compared to 2.4% for carbon dioxide (Hope 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>). This is attributed to shorter atmospheric lifetime of CH
 <sub>4</sub> in comparison to CO
 <sub>2</sub> (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Dairy cattle feeding strategies are, as such, critical to climate change risk management. Methane emissions compound weather variability and climate change risks and the magnitude of global warming. This increases the vulnerability of agricultural based livelihoods to new anthropically induced disaster risks.
