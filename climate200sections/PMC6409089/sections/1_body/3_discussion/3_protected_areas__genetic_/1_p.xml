<p>On one hand, designing biodiversity conservation strategies should maximize genetic diversity and preserve adaptive potential (

Furthermore, mountain ranges constitute important centers of diversification in arid regions and act as species pumps into surrounding areas, in addition to being important reservoirs of cryptic diversity, even of common and widespread species (
