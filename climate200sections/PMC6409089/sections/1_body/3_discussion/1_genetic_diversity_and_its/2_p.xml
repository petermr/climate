<p>Results here coincide with these findings: (1) high nucleotide diversity was found for populations of 
 <italic>Lindleya mespiloides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. caeruleus</italic> in the southernmost limits of the Chihuahuan Desert areas that have been proposed as refugia; (2) with the exception of 
 <italic>S. caeruleus</italic> the other species studied had high nucleotide diversity in several areas of the Mexican Plateau that had a stable climate during glacial periods, and moreover this species has the highest population differentiation; (3) the average of high haplotype diversity values for the five species along the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range coincided with those expected for fluctuating environments.
