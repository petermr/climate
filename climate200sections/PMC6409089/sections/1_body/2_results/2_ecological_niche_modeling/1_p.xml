<p>Model performance evaluated with the ROC is summarized in 
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, showing similar values for every studied species. 
 <xref rid="table-5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> includes eigenvalues retrieved by the PCA that were utilized to generate SMDs (individual eigenvalues for every species are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S4</xref>). In general, current ENMs accurately predicted the known distribution of every species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>), though the models over-predicted ranges of 
 <italic>E. aspera, Lindleya mespiloides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. caeruleus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). Future ENM with RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 models predicted extended ranges for all studied species, although RCP8.5 predicted less considerable areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). Suitable conditions predicted by current and future climate scenarios were identified in the Mexican Plateau, in the areas corresponding to the Mapimian and Saladan subprovinces as well as in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Results with CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM climate scenarios were congruent with RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively (included in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Fig. S2</xref>).
