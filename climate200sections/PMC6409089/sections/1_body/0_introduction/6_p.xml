<p>Using these five indicator endemic shrubby plants we aim to: (1) determine how genetic diversity is spatially distributed in the Chihuahuan Desert; (2) establish the effect of global climate change on their distribution based on predictions of future climate scenarios for 2070; (3) understand how habitat ecological resistance among species might be affected by future climate change; (4) identify the most vulnerable or resilient populations and evaluate if they are located within protected areas; (5) make recommendations for conservation decision-making.</p>
