<p>Here, we focus on the shrubby plants of the Chihuahuan Desert and using prospective ecological niche-based modeling (ENM) in five endemic species, aim to estimate whether species ranges will vary or remain the same and to identify the areas that are more likely to remain stable. Additionally, by acquiring molecular data we estimate genetic diversity of populations of these species and determine how it is spatially distributed to determine the degree of vulnerability, taking into account the ecological connectivity of the populations. The goal is to provide guidelines for conservation decision-making based on these data and the existing protected areas.</p>
