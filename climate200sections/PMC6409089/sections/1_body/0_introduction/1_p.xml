<p>The effect of future climate change on organisms has been studied from multiple perspectives, in diverse biomes, ecosystems, farming landscapes and for many taxa and functional groups of organisms. The main effects of climate change are associated with demographic threats, opportunities for expansion, and positive or negative implications with respect to the size and position of species ranges, as well as the genetic variability of populations, disequilibrium in biotic interactions and a variable capacity of adaptation in natural and agricultural systems (
