 <bold>Current and future environmental resistance to gene flow</bold>. We estimated ecological resistance among populations using the habitat suitability raster file derived from ecological niche modeling as a conductance matrix in Circuitscape 4.0.5 (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">McRae &amp; Beier, 2007</xref>). Circuitscape considers the landscape to be an electrical circuit in which populations serve as sources or sinks of electrical current, while environmental features either inhibit or assist the flow of that current by providing high or low resistance to the circuit(s) connecting the populations (
