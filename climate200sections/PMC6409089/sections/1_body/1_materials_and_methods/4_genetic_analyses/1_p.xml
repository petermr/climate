 <bold>Genetic analyses</bold>. Parameters of population diversity, such as haplotype diversity (
 <italic>h</italic>) and nucleotide diversity (Ï€), were estimated for each population using DnaSP (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Librado &amp; Rozas, 2009</xref>). Haplotype genetic diversity (
 <italic>h</italic>) was interpolated for each species using a distance weighted interpolation in ArcView v. 3.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). In order to visualize the genetic diversity on a map, we plotted this interpolation over a hill shade map obtained from the digital elevation model Hydro1K. We then averaged the genetic diversity of all species to identify the areas that share the highest genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation among populations of the studied species was estimated by pairwise
