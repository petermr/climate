 <bold>Ecological niche-based modeling</bold>. The geographical coordinates of the species utilized in this study were collected in the field and complemented with information consulted in the following herbaria: ARIZ, ENCB, MEXU, TEX and XAL as well as from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GIBIF (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</uri>) to carry out Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM). They comprised the entire distribution of species (the number of records used in each species is given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S2</xref>). 
 <italic>S. caeruleus</italic> is a relict taxon recorded in only two localities with a few individuals, and we considered all occurrences. We used the biogeographic sub-regions of the Chihuahuan Desert proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Morafka (1977</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>) based on climate and distribution data for flora and fauna: Sonora-Cochise, Transpecos, Mapimian, Saladan and Rio Pánuco; we also included the Tehuacán Valley proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Shreve (1942)</xref> as a satellite area of the Chihuahuan Desert (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Considering a pixel of one km
 <sup>2</sup>, ENM was estimated for each species. Environmental inputs were based on the 19 climate variables from the WorldClim data base version 1.4 (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>) at a 2.5 min resolution. These variables represent global precipitation and temperature conditions for the years 1960–1990.
