<p>Understanding the effect of climate change in plants of the Chihuahuan Desert is crucial: (1) dry tropical areas are extremely understudied compared to the humid biomes (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Muenchow et al., 2018</xref>); (2) species in deserts are preserved evidence of humid past. In particular the woody elements of the warm Chihuahuan Desert formed part of the Madro-Tertiary Geoglora, a fossil flora from the southwestern United States and North of Mexico so desert species are outstanding repositories of past climate changes; (3) the most decisive climate variables in deserts are related to temperature and precipitation, understanding future changes in both gives insights whether plants will be capable of adaptation to changes in these climate variables.
