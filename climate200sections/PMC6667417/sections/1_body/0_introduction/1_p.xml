<p id="Par90">Climate change is one of the global challenges facing mankind today as temperatures continue rising, triggering a host of extreme weather events such as heat waves, drought, and flooding (Feulner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). These climate-induced challenges are manifesting themselves rapidly, causing socio-economic insecurities and health challenges, particularly in marginalised communities (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2007</xref>). There is increasing evidence of indirect associations between climate change and the rise in the rates of malnutrition, poor health, hunger and starvation, as well as food and water insecurity (Bain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>; Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2013</xref>; Wheeler and von Braun 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). In addition, climate-change impacts have put an additional pressure on already stressed natural resource base, reducing the resilience of agro-ecosystems that are, in part, providing food and nutritional security in rural communities (Naluwairo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). Tackling these challenges requires a paradigm shift from the current incremental adaptation strategies towards transformative alternatives that also place an equal emphasis on human nutrition and health, as well as environmental sustainability (Francis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). In the context of marginalised farming communities, a transformative adaptation strategy is defined as one that causes a disruptive, but desirable and sustainable change to the socialâ€“ecological state of the system (Lonsdale et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>). In the context of this paper, the inclusion of adaptable nutrient dense orphan crops into marginalised agricultural systems and dominant food systems is considered part of transformative adaptation (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>).
