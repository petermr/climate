<p id="Par15">Including orphan crops as part of transformative adaptation allows for adapting to the climatic, ecological, and natural limits in which resource poor farmers, in particular, reside (Pérez-Català 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). Orphan crops can, therefore, offer opportunities for ‘fitting to’ or ‘fitting with’ the socio-ecological environment while trying to sustainably maintain the natural products or processes that are needed for sustainable food systems (Chivenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). In terms of ‘fitting to’, orphan crops can contribute to transformational adaptation through (1) upscaling adaptation efforts, (2) introducing new forms of adaptation strategies to a new region, and (3) holistic transformation of behaviour and place—landscape transformation (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017a</xref>). In addition to this, orphan crops can drive co-evolution of food systems, ‘fitting with’ the same socio-ecological environment rather than seeing it as something external (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>).
