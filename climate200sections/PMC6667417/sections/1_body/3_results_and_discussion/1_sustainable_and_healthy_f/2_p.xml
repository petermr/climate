<p id="Par12">Currently, total demand for cereals in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to increase from 2.26 to 2.60% per year during 2025–2050 (Ringler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>). Net cereal imports into sub-Saharan Africa are also expected to increase by 2050 (van Ittersum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>). For example, rice imports are expected to rise by 57.8% from 2000 to 2050 under climate change (Ringler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2010</xref>). Instead of relying heavily on the importation of food, a cost-effective strategy to diversifying crop production to meet both food and nutrition needs of a growing population could be that of exploiting climate resilient and nutritious orphan crop species (Kumar and Reinartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>; Massawe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>) and mainstreaming them into the existing food systems (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2019</xref>). For example, millets and gluten-free grains, such as amaranth (
 <italic>Amaranthus caudatus</italic>), teff (
 <italic>Eragrostis tef</italic>), and quinoa (
 <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic>) are rich in vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, phyto-chemicals, and antioxidants (Kumar and Reinartz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2018</xref>), and are considered to be more drought tolerant than their commercial counterparts. Grains from these species have been trending in many western countries as an ideal food source, being gluten free with balanced protein essential for human health (Massawe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>). While there is emerging evidence to show the low levels of nutrients such as protein, zinc, and iron for major staple crops grown under elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>, there are no similar studies for orphan crops (Gangi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>; White et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2011</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct comparative studies to determine the effect of climate change (e.g., elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>, drought, and high temperature) on nutritional quality of orphan crops. This would contribute to confirming anecdotal reports of orphan crops’ potential.
