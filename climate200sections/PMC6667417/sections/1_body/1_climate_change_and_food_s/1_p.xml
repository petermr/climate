<p id="Par5">The drivers of climate variability and change are well reviewed (de Groot et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2013</xref>; Vermeulen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2012</xref>). In the short term, increasing climate variability has a greater impact on food security than longer term changes in mean climate values (Preston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2014</xref>). Agriculture needs to adapt to sporadic and gradual changes in means and distributions of temperature and precipitation (Nelson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>). Depending on the speed and direction of these trends, adaptation needs to be reconceptualized as an unabating and transformative process, rather than intermittent and incremental (Lonsdale et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>). Under continuously changing conditions, transformative adaptation is needed to build resilience and ensure sustainable food systems (Wheeler and von Braun 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>).
