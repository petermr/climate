<p id="Par6">Food systems include all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population, namely, growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items (Preston

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>). Population growth, shifting consumption patterns, urbanization, and income re-distribution have driven the demand side (Myers et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). Patterns in food supply-side drivers, which are related to resource use (water, energy, and land), and agro-ecosystem services have not always been able to provide for the growing demand (Wheeler and von Braun 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). In addition, the impacts of global climate change on food systems are complex as they are widespread, they differ across spatial and temporal scales, and are influenced by pre-existing and emerging governance, and social and economic conditions (Meybeck and Gitz
