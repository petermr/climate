<p id="Par21">Of the 83 million ha of arable land in southern Africa, 9 million is irrigated and 74 million is rainfed. Approximately 89% of this land is used to produce major crops under rainfed agriculture, but still failing to meet the food requirements of the region as about US$35 billion is spent on food imports to supplement food deficits (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2003</xref>). As climate change threatens to reduce the land suitable for production of major crops, this could inevitably open up more land for orphan crops that do well under extreme climate and edaphic conditions (Carter and Gulati 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Crops such as finger millet, cowpea, and bambara groundnut are adapted to extreme weather (drought and heat stress) and poor soil conditions (Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2017</xref>). Due to their inherent tolerance to water deficit, they are cultivated under semi-arid conditions (Chivenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). Research has shown that several orphan crops require less water and have relatively high water use efficiencies (Chibarabada et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>; Hadebe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>) (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). They can also be grown in marginal and fragile environments, such as dry lands and swamps, and on highly degraded land that is no longer suitable for high input commercial crops (Baldermann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Naluwairo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). Therefore, land that has been condemned as unsuitable for cultivation of major crops may be suitable for cultivating adaptable orphan crops (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017b</xref>). However, the cultivation and expansion of orphan crops at a large scale must be supported with crop suitability mapping for effective matching of specific orphan crops to suitable climates (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017b</xref>).
