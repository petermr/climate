<p id="Par32">Orphan crops are mainly believed to have informal seed systems, also referred to as local, traditional, or farmer seed systems. Activities in farmer seed systems tend to be integrated and localised at the farm level, whereby the farmers themselves access seed directly from their own harvest and disseminate it through exchange and barter among friends, neighbours, and relatives; and through local markets (Venter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2007</xref>). Varieties are often land or mixed races and may be heterogeneous (modified through informal breeding and use) (Sperling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1993</xref>). Seed of orphan crops is often of variable quality (of different purity, and physical and physiological quality) (Wekundah 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2012</xref>). In addition, their seed systems are not monitored or controlled by government policies and regulations (Sperling and McGuire 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2010</xref>). Rather, local technical (indigenous) knowledge and standards, social structures and norms drive their seed systems (Sperling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2013</xref>). Based on the seed scientistsâ€™ perspective, good-quality seed is a prerequisite for successful crop production. It, therefore, follows that, in the absence of a well-regulated and supported seed system, increasing the production of orphan crops, even in their agro-ecological niches, remains a challenge. In this context, it may be necessary to consider changes in the way seed for orphan crops is currently produced and distributed.
