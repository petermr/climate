<p id="Par16">In general, orphan crops are grown at small scale, often as mixed genetic populations rather than pure lines, with minimal inputs and on marginal land (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>). While selection of the landrace to the local environment and agricultural system has happened through the constant cultivation of the crop in location, intensive selection for high input and uniform agricultural systems has not (Massawe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>; Mayes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>). Several research findings have shown that trait variation present within a crop species is a major determinant of what can be achieved through breeding; to combine the beneficial gene alleles into a single ‘ideotype’ (Donald 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1968</xref>; Gutschick 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1987</xref>). Most orphan crops still contain gene alleles and mechanisms for growth in poor environments and for resilience under stress (Voegel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2012</xref>). These have potentially been lost from major crops (and, hence, programmes to introduce variation from wild ancestors for major crops) (Ellstrand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>). However, there are many disadvantages with assessing the genetic potential of orphan crops, not least, which ones to focus on. If we at least select species with beneficial traits outside the range seen in major crops (whether this is drought tolerance, nutritional concentration or other aspects which are useful for healthy diets), then they will be a sub-set of crops which could have a major impact on food and nutritional security (Massawe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>; Mayes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>).
