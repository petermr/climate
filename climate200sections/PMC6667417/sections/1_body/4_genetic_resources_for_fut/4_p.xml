<p id="Par19">The release of the genome sequences will be important, but to be able to exploit the new information, there is a need to develop structured genetic material for both research and breeding to elucidate the genetic control of traits and develop markers. Such material also could allow selections by farmers in the target location (which requires suitable adaptation and farmer preference traits, fitting into the current agricultural systems). For orphan crop systems, we do not have the extensive history of pedigree-based approaches which exists for more major species and often collections of orphan crop accessions will have very distant divergence times. This potentially makes the use of Nested Association Mapping (NAM) (Buckler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2008</xref>), Multiparent advanced generation intercross populations (MAGIC) (Bandillo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>; Gardner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>), and even Genomic Selection (GS) (Jannink et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>) and examples from wheat and oil palm (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>; Kwong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>) of interest. Such populations could be deployed in many locations, with local farmers identifying the material most suited to their needs and preferences.
