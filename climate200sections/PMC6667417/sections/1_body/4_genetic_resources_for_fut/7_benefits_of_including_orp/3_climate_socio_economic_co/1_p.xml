<p id="Par29">Orphan crops can provide and improve income for the poor, especially women and youth, who generate income from agricultural activities, particularly in rural areas (Kour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>; Naluwairo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). As previously alluded (cf. Climate–environment co-benefits of orphan crops), orphan crops require low levels of inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers, which reduces input costs for farmers (Dansi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2012</xref>; Kour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>). They are also resistant to pests and diseases, and tolerant to environmental extremes and less favourable weather conditions, unlike major crops (Chivenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Naluwairo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>; Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>), meaning that the source of income for the farmers will not be disrupted. Within communities, orphan crops can offer cross-cutting solutions to multiple constraints. For instance, sorghum, millet, bambara groundnut, lentils, and groundnuts are recommended food choices under the nutritional and water limited conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In this regard, they can benefit low-income producers and consumers of food who are limited in their capacity to adapt to increasing climatic risks (Vermeulen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2012</xref>). Therefore, the promotion and inclusion (i.e., mainstreaming) of orphan crops could contribute towards address Sustainable Development Goals related to social and economic issues; specifically, SDGs 1, 2, 3, 8, and 15 (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>).
