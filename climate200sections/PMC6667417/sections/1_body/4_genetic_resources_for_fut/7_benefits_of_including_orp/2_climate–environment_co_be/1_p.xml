<p id="Par28">Orphan crops are important for the conservation of agricultural biodiversity and agro-ecosystems which are critical for the long-term sustainability of food and agricultural production (Baldermann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Naluwairo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). In addition, the adoption of orphan crops could contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Chivenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). Food systems, through the conversion of natural lands to agricultural land for crop and/or livestock production, and the intensification of production on the existing agricultural lands, make up approximately 19–30% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (Donati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>; Hallström et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>; Springmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2016b</xref>). The production of food from animals utilises large areas of land and, as a result, bears greater environmental impacts than fruit and vegetable production due to the high levels of nitrogen and GHG emissions (Donati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>; Stehfest et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2009</xref>). Springmann et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">b</xref>) report that approximately 80% of the emissions from food systems are associated with livestock production. Hence, our dietary food choices affect our health and the environment. Orphan crops can also reduce the contribution of environmental contaminants by agriculture. Orphan crops can tolerate pests and diseases, and grow in soils of low quality and are known to require lower levels of inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers.
