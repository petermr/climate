<p id="Par18">An objective for many inbreeding major crop species is to develop hybrids. While development of hybrids would offer potential yield increases and greater hybrid vigour (Elhani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>; Mabhaudhi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>), it is unlikely to be achieved for years in many orphan crops. However, for orphan crops, there has often been relatively little conventional breeding and a significant progress could be made by a well-organised conventional breeding programme (Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2002b</xref>). As more information is generated at the genetic and trait levels from orphan crop species, it becomes more feasible to include marker-assisted selection as an integrated component of the breeding programme. The development of the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.africanorphancrops.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.africanorphancrops.org</ext-link>), including a remit to generate the genome sequence of 101 African Orphan Crop Genomes and re-sequence 100 lines of each, should accelerate the adoption of molecular breeding and research in these crops. The first five genome assemblies have been released for bambara groundnut (

 <italic>Faidherbia albida</italic>), marula (
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic>), and moringa (
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>) (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>), and hopefully represent the beginning of a new genome-enabled breeding era for orphan crops.
