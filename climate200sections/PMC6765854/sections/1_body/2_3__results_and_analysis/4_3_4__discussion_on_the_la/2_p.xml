<p>In order to study the dynamic change of NDVI response to climatic factors in the growing season, with the method of multiple nested time series analysis, we divide 2001–2017 into seven periods, 2001–2011, 2001–2012, 2001–2013, …, 2001–2017 and conduct GRA, respectively. The statistical results (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03452-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) show that the response of the NDVI to mean air temperature in the growing season of the seven periods from 2001 to 2017 occurs in the current month, but the lag is not obvious, the response time to cumulative precipitation is gradually shortening; in 2001–2011, 2001–2012 and 2001–2013 the response of the NDVI lags behind cumulative precipitation by one month, but after 2014, it basically responded in the current month; the response of the NDVI to relative humidity lags behind by 2 months; the response of the NDVI to sunshine duration lags behind by 3 Months. The response time of NDVI to climatic factors (except cumulative precipitation) in the seven study periods almost remain the same, and the lag response time of NDVI to climate factors has higher stability.
