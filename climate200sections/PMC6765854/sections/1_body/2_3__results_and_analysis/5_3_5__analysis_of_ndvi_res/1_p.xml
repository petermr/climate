<p>Based on the results of the lag response analysis, the total time period (2001â€“2017) is selected to analyze the response of NDVI to climatic factors. The correlation analysis between NDVI and air temperature in the study area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f008">Figure 8</xref>a) shows that the GRD between NDVI and air temperature is between 0.394 and 0.944, with an average of 0.613. The high-value (&gt;0.613) area is mainly distributed in the study area at the junction of the Sichuan and Qinghai provinces, the central and southern part of Qinghai and the central and southern part of Tibet. The vegetation types are mainly meadows, grasslands, coniferous forests, broad-leaved forests, alpine vegetation and so on. The low-value (&lt;0.613) area is mainly distributed at the junction of Tibet, Sichuan and Qinghai, and the vegetation types are mainly meadows and shrubs.
