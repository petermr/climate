<p>On the time scale of 17 years, the GRD between NDVI and cumulative precipitation in TP is between 0.410 and 0.921 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f008">Figure 8</xref>b), with an average of 0.616. Among them, the NDVI values of grasslands, meadows, coniferous forests and shrubs, which are distributed at the junction of the Tibet and eastern Qinghai Province, the central part of Qinghai Province and the northern part of Yunnan Province, have a relatively high correlation with the cumulative precipitation. The NDVI values of meadows, broad-leaved forests and grasslands distributed in large areas of eastern Qinghai Province and southeastern part of Tibet are less correlated with cumulative precipitation. The GRD of low-altitude area is 0.588, the mid-altitude 0.615, the high-altitude 0.615, and the extremely high-altitude 0.625 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f009">Figure 9</xref>). With the increase of altitude, the NDVI is affected by accumulative precipitation, and the low-altitude area is basically located in the southeastern part of TP, where rivers are densely covered and abundant precipitation causes the correlation between NDVI and precipitation to be relatively low.
