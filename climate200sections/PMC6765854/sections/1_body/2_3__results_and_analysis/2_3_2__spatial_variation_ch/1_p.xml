The significance test of the NDVI trend analysis in the study area indicates that the ratio of area showing an increasing trend of NDVI in the growing season of the study area is 68.11%. Areas with significant increase (15.40%) are mainly distributed in the Gansu, eastern Sichuan, central and western Qinghai, and southeastern Tibet while areas with extremely significant increase (7.31%) are mainly located in the central and eastern parts of the study area. The ratio of area showing decreasing trend of NDVI in the growing season is 31.89% (the areas with extremely significant reduction and significant reduction accounting for 0.89% and 2.50% of the total area respectively). Areas with significant reduction, extremely significant reduction are mainly distributed in the central Qinghai and central Tibet.
