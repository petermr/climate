<p>According to the annual mean NDVI in the growing season of TP from 2001 to 2017, the interannual variation of NDVI during the 17-year period is obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). In the study periods, the mean NDVI in the growing season shows a upward trend. The annual mean NDVI of the growing season is 0.49 with a growth rate of 0.01/10a (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.36, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). The mean NDVI of 2001–2008, 2014 and 2015 is lower than the multi-year mean level. The mean NDVI of 2009–2013, 2016 and 2017 is higher than the multi-year mean level. The lowest value of NDVI (0.48) appears in 2003, the highest value (0.51) appears in 2012. The mean NDVI in the growing season of TP shows small peaks in 2010, 2012 and 2017 respectively. In 2003, 2007, 2014 and 2015, there are obvious low values, which may attribute to the hydrothermal environment of the year. According to the statistics of climatic data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), the positive anomaly of mean air temperature in 2010 is 11.33%, the relative humidity shows negative anomaly, the sunshine duration and the precipitation don’t change much, and an increase of air temperature may be more suitable for vegetation growth when other climatic conditions are relatively stable. The NDVI in the growing season reaches its maximum in 2012, which may be related to the increase of air temperature and precipitation in the year. In 2016, only air temperature shows positive anomaly. Although relative humidity changes greatly, the anomaly of precipitation and sunshine duration is small, and the rise of air temperature reduces the suppression of vegetation activity in the growing season. In 2003, there is a decrease of air temperature, a significant decrease of sunshine duration, a significant increase of precipitation and relative humidity. The decrease of air temperature and sunshine duration led to suppression of vegetation growth. The NDVI in the growing season of 2007 is lower than that in 2006, and the air temperature and the sunshine duration of the year shows positive anomaly, while the relative humidity is negative, and the precipitation does not change much. However, the precipitation decreases severely in the previous year, and the percentage of positive anomaly in air temperature and sunshine duration are 4.13% and 5.94%, respectively. This warm-drying climate change is not conducive to vegetation growth and may affect the NDVI of the next year’s vegetation growing season. The NDVI values in the growing season of the study area in 2014 and 2015 are both low, but the causes of this result are different. The hydrothermal conditions in 2014 shows that precipitation increased sharply and sunshine duration reduce significantly when air temperature and relative humidity do not change much. This phenomenon leads to suppression of vegetation growth. In 2015, the NDVI value in the growing season of the study area is relatively low. The percentage of positive anomaly of sunshine duration is 5.59%, and relative humidity and precipitation display negative anomaly, 5.03% and 15.35%, respectively. The hydrothermal combination of drastically reduced precipitation as well as relative humidity, and the significant increase of sunshine duration, are likely to result in drought and a decrease in the NDVI value.
