<p>Piao et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used the correlation analysis method to study the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation quantitative factors and climate change, but the correlation analysis method generally requires each variable to meet the joint normal distribution. The extreme values of the factors in the analysis process will also influence the correlation analysis results [

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] used the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method to study the relationship between vegetation index and climatic factors. GRA is considered to be an analysis of the geometric proximity between different discrete sequences within a system. The proximity is described by the grey relational degree, which is regarded as a measure of the similarities of discrete data that can be arranged in sequential order [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Differing from the traditional mathematical analysis, GRA provides a simple scheme to analyze the series relationships or the system behavior, even if the input information is less. But the related studies were mainly based on the overall statistical value of the study area or limited sample points. Thus, the results lacked detailed description of vegetation responses to different climate factors in the study area. As for the time period adopted in the research, some scholars [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have realized that the linear trend of the overall study period could not fully express the actual dynamic model of vegetation growth change, while the existing studies mainly focus on the change of the whole time period, disregarding continuity of the change process and the variation trend during the time period.
