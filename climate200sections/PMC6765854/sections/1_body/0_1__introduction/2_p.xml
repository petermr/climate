 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. China is located in the East Asian monsoon region, with complex climate types and rich vegetation types. There are greater differences in vegetation changes and its correlation with hydrothermal factors in different regions. The lag time for vegetation responses to climate factors is also different. Owing to the tight coupling process of surface water heat exchange, warming may have different effects on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) ecosystems. The rise of air temperature can not only reduce the suppression of vegetation activity in the growing season [

Many researchers believe that the effects of hydrothermal conditions on the vegetation growth in TP are mutual. Studying the response of NDVI and climatic factors in the vegetation growing season in TP should include the study of hydrothermal factors [
