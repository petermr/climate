 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied the response of NDVI to climatic factors in Kansas from 1989 to 1997 and found that different vegetation types responded to air temperature and precipitation in different ways, and had different lag times. Ding et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] utilized the NDVI data of NOAA/AVHRR satellites from 1982 to 2000 to study the response and spatial characteristics of vegetation cover in TP to hydrothermal conditions during the year, and considered that in TP, except for forests, correlation between NDVI of all vegetation types and precipitation is higher than that of air temperature. The NDVI of TP has a lag effect on air temperature and precipitation, and there is a spatial difference in the lagging level, ranging from 10 days to 90 days. Du et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] used multiple nested time series to analyze the variation trend of NDVI in the vegetation growing season from 1982 to 2012 and the response relationship with climatic factors. They found that the area where vegetation activity in TP increased or decreased significantly would continue to expand, but the rate of expansion in areas with significant reduction is significantly higher than that of the significantly increased area.
