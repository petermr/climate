<p>Regarding the lag time of NDVI to climatic factors in the growing season, based on the data of MOD09A1 8d, the response of NDVI to climatic factors in TP shows that the response to air temperature is not obvious, but lags behind precipitation by 1 month, relative humidity by 1–2 months, and sunshine duration by 2–3 months. This is different from what Ding et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] has found that the NDVI of TP lags behind air temperature and precipitation by 10 days to 90 days, largely due to: (1) in the overall context of global warming, the hydrothermal environment of TP has undergone major changes recently [

(2) In the past studies on vegetation of TP, the NOAA/AVHRR NDVI data was used, but the AVHRR sensor has a wide band in the visible and near-infrared bands, and contains several strong water vapor absorption bands, which reduces the reliability of the calculated NDVI. Compared with AVHRR, the visible spectrum of the MODIS sensor increases the sensitivity to chlorophyll, while the near-infrared band eliminates the interference of atmospheric water vapor [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, several months of climatic data have been used. Based on the NDVI data of the growing season (May–September), we calculated the GRD of mean air temperature, cumulative precipitation, relative humidity and sunshine duration for current month (May–September), the previous one month (April–August), the previous two month (March–July), and the previous three month (February–June). On the basis of the calculated GRDs, the response time of NDVI to climatic factors in the growing season of TP is obtained.
