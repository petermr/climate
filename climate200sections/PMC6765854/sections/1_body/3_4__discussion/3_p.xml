<p>This paper discusses the response of NDVI variation in the vegetation growing season of TP to climatic factors (air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and sunshine duration). In addition, there is a significant correlation between vegetation growth and extreme weather. Relevant research indicates that the minimum air temperature and water vapor pressure will have an important impact on the NDVI variation in TP during the year, while the potential evapotranspiration and wind speed will have an important impact on interannual variation of NDVI [

Before the 21st century, especially in the 1980s and 1990s, due to excessive grazing, deforestation or farmland, the destruction of surface vegetation was severe, resulting in the continuous deterioration of the ecological environment in TP, serious soil erosion on the plateau, and threatened biodiversity [

 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similar to many studies, this study found that the NDVI values of grasslands and meadows in the central and eastern TP continued to rise during 2001â€“2017, and the extensive implementation of ecological restoration measures for planting trees, grass grazing, and sand control played an important role in the process. Owing to the superposition of human factors, the sensitivity of vegetation growth to climatic factors changes, which ultimately leads to differences in the degree and speed of response of NDVI to air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and sunshine duration.
