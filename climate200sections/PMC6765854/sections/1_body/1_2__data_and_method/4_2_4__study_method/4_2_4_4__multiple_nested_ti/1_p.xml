<p>In this paper, the method of MNTSA proposed by Du et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] is used to discuss the response process of NDVI changes in TP to climate change. MNTSA is a method with a fixed starting year and a gradual increase of the ending year. This paper selects the growth period from 7 periods: 2001–2011, 2001–2012, ..., 2001–2017 to calculate the NDVI variation trends and their responses to climatic factors.
