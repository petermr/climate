<p>Distortion of climatic data may occur due to changes in the observation instruments and the surrounding environment of the observation spots. For data from meteorological stations, it is necessary to conduct homogeneity test to eliminate the unavailable data; for some missing data of the meteorological stations, linear regression method is used for interpolation and supplementation [

 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this paper, as the accuracy of station interpolation data is verified, we finally decided to select IDW for relative humidity interpolation, Kriging for precipitation and sunshine duration interpolation. Because air temperature has a certain altitude sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the spatial interpolation of air temperature is carried out by using DEM as the covariate with the interpolation method of the partial thin plate smoothing splines method.
