  <p>Estimates of global surface temperature anomaly from model integrations performed in support of the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). Here, the observed anomaly (black) is estimated relative to the observed climatology, while the model anomalies are estimated relative to each model’s estimate of climatology (rather than the multimodel ensemble mean estimate of climatology). This has the implicit effect of removing each model’s individual climatological bias against observations. The range of uncorrected model temperatures for the period 1961 to 1990 is shown in a small bar to the right of the figure. While uncertainty in observational estimate of absolute temperatures is about 0.5 °C, uncertainty in the anomalies is much smaller. As such, the spread in model anomalies relative to the multimodel ensemble mean is larger than the observed trend in the anomalies and much larger than the uncertainty in the observed anomalies.
