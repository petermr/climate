  <title>Box 1. Reliable global climate models are vitalâ€”for both societal applications and the advancement of science</title>
  <sec id="s2">
   <title>Decision making:</title>
   <p>While the basis for decarbonizing rests on simple, unequivocal, physical principles, any policy or strategy that requires knowledge of climate change at the regional level (whether for climate adaptation or for quantifying the impact of solar radiation management) requires models and rests on their fidelity. Crucially, being able to anticipate what would otherwise be surprises in extreme weather and climate variations (possibly outside the range of those experienced to date) requires much more accurate and reliable models than we currently have.</p>

   <title>Extended prediction:</title>
   <p>The predictability of slowly evolving components of the earth system provides a physical basis for useful prediction on timescales beyond those of weather forecasts. Experience with short-term forecasting, where predictability and bias reduction have gone hand in hand, teaches us that realizing this predictability hinges on the fidelity of the models making the predictions. Developing reliable tools for seasonal and decadal prediction will also help society become more resilient to the changing extremes of weather and climate caused by anthropogenic climate change.</p>

   <title>Observations:</title>
   <p>An ability to infer the present or past state of the climate system depends critically on the fidelity of the models used to assimilate these observations. In many cases, weather forecasts fail not because of shortcomings in the observational data but because the models have insufficient resolution to assimilate key information contained in the observational data (

   <title>Theory:</title>
   <p>Theory is vital when making predictions about the future. Robustly simulated changes from models that more directly express physical laws beg explanation. Simulations will stimulate theory by focusing efforts on the salient question of the underpinnings of predicted changes rather than on the elaboration of parameterizations with little physical grounding. Conversely but in the same spirit, what models robustly fail to simulate has proven invaluable in shaping the present discourse on climate change, by discrediting alternate explanations for observed changes.</p>
