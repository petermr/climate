<p>If climate science aspires to be relevant to societies dealing with climate change, a new strategy (

 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>). A fresh wind, in the form of a step change in the physical content and fidelity of climate simulation systems, must be let loose to fan the flame of basic climate science to challenge our understanding of how global warming becomes manifest in regional climate and its subsystems. The stirrings of such a wind are beginning to be felt, as in different laboratories around the world, experimental efforts aimed at harnessing exascale computing to surmount roadblocks, known to limit the fidelity of existing simulation systems, are taking shape (

 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr"/>â€“

However, if these stirrings are to grow to the gale required to give impetus to theory and observations and if society is to fully realize the ensuing benefits, these efforts must be scaled up through bold, sustained, and coordinated multinational initiatives.
