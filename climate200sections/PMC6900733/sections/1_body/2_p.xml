<p>How can we can reconcile our dissatisfaction with the comprehensive models that we use to predict and project global climate with our confidence in the big picture? The answer to this question is actually not so complicated. All one needs to remember is that confidence in the big picture is not primarily derived from the fidelity of comprehensive climate models of the type used to inform national and international assessments of climate change. Rather, it stems from our ability to link observed changes in climate to changes derived from the application of physical reasoning, often as encoded in much simpler models or in the case of the water cycle, through a rather simple application of the laws of thermodynamics. Comprehensive climate models have been effective and essential to address the concern that such a basic understanding could be overly simplistic (i.e., missing something important, such as the existence of a mode of internal variability, which could, if it were to exist, explain trends in global mean temperature). The enterprise of making models more and more comprehensive through the incorporation of computationally expensive

When it comes to global climate change, it is what the present generation of comprehensive climate models do not show—namely, a sensitivity of global changes to either the vagaries of unpredictable regional or global circulations or effects of processes neglected in simpler models—which makes them such a powerful confirmation of inferences from basic physics and simple models.
