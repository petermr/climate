<p id="Par68">The 
 <bold>climate change fatalists</bold> can be described as conservative, they trust in habits and traditions, show poor skills in problem-solving and innovation, and feel paralyzed because of the negative development of economic, legal, and policy conditions. The climate change fatalists run specialized 
 <bold>farms</bold> and perceive their farms as small and experienced impacts as highly adverse. However, the size of their farms is above the Austrian average and the perceived impacts are lower than one would expect from statistical reports. This indicates the relevance of subjective realities for climate change appraisal. 
 <bold>Farm succession</bold> is not clear and 
 <bold>regional characteristics</bold> do not seem relevant for the farmersâ€™ risk perception, adaptation intentions, and avoidance.
