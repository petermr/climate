<p id="Par27">According to the criterion of ‘theoretical saturation’ (Glaser and Strauss 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1967</xref>), sampling was stopped when informational saturation was reached, i.e. when no new insights were obtained. The sample size is sufficient because of the explorative character of our study which aims at describing a detailed picture of Austrian farmers’ perceptions and adaptation intentions in various farming contexts and because of combining the maximum variation sample and the saturation criterion (Baker and Edwards 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>; Crouch and McKenzie 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>).
