<p id="Par76">The four groups of farmers address adaptation costs differently. While the climate change adaptors consciously accept high costs for successful adaptation, the integrative adaptors emphasize potential savings from measures that yield benefits for both the environmental and adaptation performance of their farms, and the climate change fatalists appraise costs for adaptation measures as too high. The cost-benefit calculators balance expected benefits against adaptation costs, and highlight adaptation costs as major determining factor for implementing long-term adaptation measures. Park et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2012</xref> have come to a similar conclusion showing that adaptation costs are particularly decisive for long-term, transformative adaptation.
