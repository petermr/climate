<p id="Par8">Despite purposeful selection of farming regions is standard for this type of research (Woods et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2017</xref>), it also means that the research results for Austrian farmers are of limited transferability to other cultural contexts and geographic regions. However, the results may be partially translated to farming regions that share similar cultural values and norms and are located in comparable agro-environmental zones, i.e. continental and alpine south as reported in Metzger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>. Accordingly, we may expect similar response strategies to climate change, i.e. adaptation intention or avoidance, in several farming regions in Central and Eastern Europe, where investigations on farmersâ€™ climate change perceptions and adaptation intentions are limited.
