<p id="Par6">Third, scientific knowledge on farmers’ perspectives on climate change adaptation is limited to a small region and selected adaptation measures (Pröbstl-Haider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>). It lacks on a profound understanding of Austrian farmers’ climate change and adaptation appraisal even though it has been argued that such information could be useful to inform adaptation engagement strategies, outreach efforts, and the design of agricultural and climate policies (Arbuckle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). Even more, practitioners working in agricultural and environmental organizations, i.e. agricultural knowledge brokers, perceive that Austrian farmers’ adaptation efforts are limited and climate change-related challenges and chances are not fully addressed in different Austrian farming regions (Mitter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2018</xref>). The farmers’ lack in timely adaptation is evident even though selected adaptation measures have been identified effective for particular farming regions (Kirchner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>; Mitter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>; Schönhart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2014</xref>), and collaboration between scientists and agricultural stakeholders has been intensified in the context of climate change adaptation (see e.g. Mitter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>).
