<p>Relative to malaria, less is known about the net impact of climate change on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases and their vectors. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> have both (re)emerged and spread worldwide throughout tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate zones in urban areas. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is restricted to warm, urban environments where it breeds in human-made containers in and around houses. Further, it bites during the daytime exclusively on humans, and is a highly competent vector for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and other viruses. In contrast, while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> can adopt this urban ecology, it is far more ecologically flexible, and occurs in suburban, rural, residential, and agricultural habitats and breeds in both natural or human-made containers. It bites humans and a wide range of mammals and birds, and is a moderately competent vector for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.
