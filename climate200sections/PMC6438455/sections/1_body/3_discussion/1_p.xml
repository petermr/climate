<p>The dynamics of mosquito-borne illnesses are climate-driven, and current work suggests that climate change will dramatically increase the potential for expansion and intensification of 
 <italic>Aedes-</italic>borne virus transmission within the next century. Modeling studies have anticipated climate-driven emergence of dengue and chikungunya at higher latitudes [

 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne virus expansion into regions that lack previous exposure is particularly concerning, given the potential for explosive outbreaks when arboviruses are first introduced into naïve populations, like chikungunya and Zika in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The emergence of a Zika pandemic in the Old World [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or introduction of dengue anywhere a particular serotype has not recently been found, is a critical concern for global health preparedness. However, because effects of climate on vector-borne disease transmission are nonlinear [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], climate change may increase transmission potential in some settings and decrease it in others, yet the potential for climate-driven shifts and decreases in disease burden is less well-understood (but see Ryan et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Using geospatial projections of a mechanistic temperature-dependent transmission model, we investigated geographic, seasonal, and population changes in risk of virus transmission by two globally important vectors,
