<p>These future predictions of global climate suitability for transmission risk are inherently stochastic, and the degree to which our models will correspond to reality depends not only on uncertainty about climate change, but also on uncertainty about the other environmental, biological, and social factors that drive disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For example, reductions in transmission may be less prevalent than we expect here, if viruses and vectors evolve higher upper thermal limits for transmission. Because mosquito survival is most limiting to transmission at high temperatures for both mosquito species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], increasing the thermal limits for transmission would require mosquitoes to adapt to higher survival at warm temperatures, but selective pressure on mosquitoes might instead promote faster development and reproductive cycles over short lifespans. The extent to which mosquitoes and viruses can adapt to warming temperatures remains a critical empirical gap, though there is limited evidence of a mosquito genotype by chikungunya virus strain by temperature interaction in the laboratory, suggesting that populations may vary in transmission potential across temperatures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Increases in transmission risk are also complicated by other factors that drive transmission such as the presence or absence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, which are also undergoing range shifts facilitated by both climate change and human movement. Our model describes areas where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> are currently absent but could be present in the future, and may represent overestimates of risk should 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> ranges fail to expand into these areas. Whether expanding transmission risk leads to future viral establishment and outbreaks depends not only on pathogen introduction, but also on land use patterns and urbanization at regional scales, which mediate vector distributions and vectorâ€“human contact rates [
