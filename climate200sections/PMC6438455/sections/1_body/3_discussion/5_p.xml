<p>In addition, the accuracy of the model predictions for different combinations of vector, virus, and region depends on how vector and virus traits vary across populations and regions. The data used to fit the mechanistic models are derived from dengue virus traits in mosquitoes from multiple source populations from independently-published trait thermal response studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, many of the traits are measured in laboratory strains and rearing conditions, which may distort life-history relative to wild vector populations, although this will be more problematic for pathogens with longer development times, such as malaria [

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the most commonly implicated vector of dengue, our results suggest a strong link between warming temperatures and increased transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The temperature-dependent transmission models were also originally validated for chikungunya and Zika viruses in the Americas and performed well, indicating coarse-scale predictability of climate-dependent patterns of transmission [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> transmission potential in south and southeast Asia are particularly notable because the vector is common in that region, where it transmits the introduced Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) of chikungunya (characterized by the E1-226V mutation, which increases transmission efficiency by

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]). In south and southeast Asia, these results might suggest a decreased risk of chikungunya transmission in the most extreme climate scenarios, while arbovirus transmission by
