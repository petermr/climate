 <italic>aegypti</italic>, we predict, counterintuitively, that partial climate change mitigation could cause greater increases in exposure risk, particularly for transmission by

 <italic>albopictus</italic>, than no mitigation. However, partial mitigation is predicted to decrease the people, geographic areas, and length of seasons of risk for transmission by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the primary vector of arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, in most regions. Total mitigation (down to pre-industrial baselines) would presumably prevent this redistribution of global risk more effectively. Given the current insufficient response to curb carbon emissions and keep temperatures below the 2°C warming target [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], models such as those presented here can be useful as a means to anticipate possible future changes in climate and temperature-driven transmission risk, depending on the degree of mitigation achieved.
