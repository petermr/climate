<p>Examining the results by region (

  <xref rid="pntd.0007213.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
  <xref rid="pntd.0007213.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>
 </bold>), we find that the regional velocity of climate change is likely to determine the future landscape of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmission risk. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, increases in the population at risk are expected across the globe and for all climate scenarios and years except in the Caribbean. The most notable net increases in all transmission risk are in Europe, east Asia, high-elevation parts of central America and east Africa, and the United States and Canada. But increases are expected across the board except in the Caribbean, where minor net losses are expected across scenarios and years. In contrast, for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, more region-specific changes are anticipated. Major increases in Europe are expected for all climate scenarios and years, with smaller increases in Central America, east Africa, east Asia, and the U.S. and Canada. However, major net decreases in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> transmission potential are expected in several regions, including tropical Latin America, western Africa, south Asia and most of southeast Asia, with a net reduction of nearly 125 million people at risk by 2080 in RCP 8.5. Because the upper thermal limit for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> transmission is relatively low (29.4Â°C), the largest declines in transmission potential in western Africa and southeast Asia are expected with the largest extent of warming, while less severe warming could produce broader increases and more moderate declines in transmission potential. The difference between RCP 6.0 and 8.5 is on the order of 50 million fewer people at risk in west Africa and 100 million fewer in Southeast Asia in the warmer scenario, highlighting just how significant the degree of mitigation will be for regional health pathways.
