<p>In the original modeling study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], empirical data were compiled on transmission of dengue virus by both mosquito species, and the models for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were subsequently validated on human case data compiled for three viruses (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). The model performed well describing the observed thermal range of transmission for all three viruses, and indicated it was likely adequate for chikungunya and Zika in the absence of more tailored information. Specifically, a statistical model based on the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) model predicted the probability of autochthonous transmission in country-scale weekly disease data across the Americas with 86–91% out-of-sample accuracy for dengue and with 66–69% accuracy for chikungunya and Zika, and predicted the magnitude of incidence given local transmission for all three viruses with 85–86% accuracy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A subsequent study using the same 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) approach and updated Zika-specific thermal response data has found that the thermal optimum and upper thermal limit for Zika transmission were the same as those of dengue but that the minimum temperature for transmission was higher than that of dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], indicating that the model’s accuracy may vary slightly across viruses transmitted by the focal mosquitoes. Our results are most applicable to dengue, and may offer an indication of possible future scenarios for other viruses, which can be refined as more virus-specific data are collected. For many emerging viruses of concern transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (like Mayaro or St. Louis encephalitis viruses), the data necessary to parameterize temperature-dependent transmission models may not be available for several years.
