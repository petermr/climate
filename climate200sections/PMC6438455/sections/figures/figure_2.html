 <caption> Mapping future temperature suitability for transmission scenarios for Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Maps of monthly suitability based on a temperature threshold corresponding to the posterior probability that scaled R 0 &gt; 0 is greater or equal to 97.5%, for transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for predicted mean monthly temperatures under current climate and future scenarios for 2050 and 2080: a. RCP 2.6 and b. RCP 8.5 in HadGEM2-ES. </caption>
