  <title>Changing year-round (12 month) population at risk due to temperature suitability for 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> virus transmission.
  </title>
  <p>All values are given in millions; future projections are averaged across GCMs, broken down by year (2050, 2080) and RCP (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5), and are given as net change from current population at risk. 0+/0- denote the sign of smaller non-zero values that rounded to 0.0, whereas “0” denotes true zeros. (Losses do not indicate loss of any transmission, only to reduction 11 or fewer months.).</p>
