<p>Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents regarded climate change as an intervening variable for their health. The respondents opined that climate change altered diseases such as malaria, respiratory infections and skin infections, while fewer respondents agreed on the same for bilharzia, diarrhoea and malnutrition. Similar results were posited by the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication (CIMC) (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) when about 63% of the respondents stated that climate change was related to health epidemics. The Asian Foundation (
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) found 80% of the respondents confirmed that health hazards were among the household-level impacts of climate change. Thus, the findings of this study are within the confines of related studies. The health impacts of climate change mentioned tally well with some literature (IPCC
