   <p>Too much rainfall brings about floods, and hence outbreaks of diseases, hunger and malnutrition.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Rainfall has become erratic and food shortages occur, with diseases rising.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Lack of food for the family, loss of weight.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Unable to feed my family because I depend on farming as an activity, thus putting my family at risk of poverty.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Unable to feed my family because I depend on agriculture to survive.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>It affects agriculture because crops would not grow well and animals die because of starvation and hunger as a result of shortages of water caused by low rainfall. As a result of high temperature, crops wilt and animals die. Death of livestock because of lack of water and pasture resulting in inadequate access to protein in diet.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Climate change can cause scarcity in water resources, thereby causing diarrhoea. It can lead to vector breeding. Climate change is the major cause of most health problems we are experiencing in the community.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Outbreaks of diseases which affect people and livestock.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>During hot weather, we do not sleep in mosquito nets.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Livestock sold unplanned and at unprofitable prices. Disease outbreaks and increase. People who are poor because of climate change are dying without seeking proper medication at better health centres because they do not have enough money from either their livestock or their cash crops.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Temperatures go beyond levels that our bodies are used to and new infections are emerging.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>We will not have enough food and hence malnutrition.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Because of the changes in climate, many people are dying.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Sun heat causes headache in both adults and children.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>When temperatures increase, mosquitoes breed fast, resulting in enhanced spread of malaria, headache and dysentery.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>New diseases emerge while people frequently fell sick (

  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Lack of rainfall is causing most of the diseases; people are drinking water from the same sources as animals, which causes many diseases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Climate change results in shortage of proper diet and unavailability of water for activities such as gardening and feeding of domestic animals.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>High temperatures cause skin damages and excessive sweating during the day and at night, leading to dehydration and body weaknesses.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Too little and too much rainfall cause food scarcity, too much temperatures such as heat waves exhaust the body and mosquitoes become active and hence malaria becomes a problem.</p>
