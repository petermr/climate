<p>Hazards were pervasive; however, those who experienced these hazards were not aware of the link between these hazards and climate change. Most of the respondents (89%) stated that they had encountered some form of meteorological and hydrological hazards. However, contrary to expectations and findings from other studies (Lujala, Lein &amp; RÃ¸d 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Menny et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), climate change knowledge about repository had been found to be unrelated to personal experience with these hazards. Lujala et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) stated that climate change knowledge, attitudes and perceptions are explained by direct personal experience of damage posed by climate-related events such as floods and landslides. Related to the argument that personal experiences of hazards pose a greater impact on climate knowledge, Menny et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) argued that experience of extreme weather events affects the knowledge regarding climate change. The finding therefore implies a huge climate change knowledge deficit even among those who had experienced climate change-related hazards.
