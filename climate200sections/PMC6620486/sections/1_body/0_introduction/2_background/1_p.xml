<p>Observed and anticipated changes in climate include changes in precipitation, heatwaves, hurricanes and storms. These changes in the surrounding environment affect human health through complex interactions with human behaviour. The changes in climate are often rapid and have widespread threats to human life. Change in climate, either naturally or because of human factors, has certain effects and impacts on agriculture, food security and health of communities. The direct and indirect impacts of climate change are predicted to have severe consequences for African societies and economies (Ajani, Mgbenka &amp; Okeke

 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Rural communities are believed to be particularly vulnerable to climate change (Holmes

 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).Vulnerability of rural households in Africa is caused not only by exposure to climate change, but also by a combination of social, economic and environmental factors that interact with it (David et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).While literature on climate change has been growing in Zimbabwe (Simba, Chikodzi &amp; Murwendo 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Tshuma &amp; Mathuthu 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), specific locality evidence on climate change, community understanding of the climate phenomenon and evidence on health impacts is still scarce. Establishing the extent to which local communities understand climate change and related health hazards, and their responses, is important for effective disaster risk management.
