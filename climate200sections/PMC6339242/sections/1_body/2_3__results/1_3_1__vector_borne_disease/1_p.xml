<p>Dengue, a viral disease transmitted by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, represents a priority health risk in Dominica as the disease has a significant epidemic potential [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Over the past 25 years, the country has experienced a rise in dengue cases, with significant increases over the last 10 years. As is the case for much of the Caribbean, a seasonal pattern of dengue outbreaks has been observed in Dominica, with the majority of cases occurring between July and December when temperatures are warm and precipitation increases [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A changing climate may increase transmission rates of vector-borne diseases in Dominica. Increasing temperatures reduce the time taken for virus replication within the mosquito, the extrinsic incubation period. Evidence suggests that increased mosquito survival, reproductive capacity, and biting frequency are also sensitive to temperature [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Key informant interviews with health sector experts in Dominica indicated that the strength of the link between vector-borne diseases and climate change and the potential severity of impacts to society is high.
