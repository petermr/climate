<p>Food insecurity in Dominica is significantly influenced by the health and productivity of the surrounding terrestrial and coastal environments used for food production as well as climate variables, access to food sources, and socioeconomic status. Dominica imports a substantial amount of food [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and the stability of these imports also influences the population’s exposure to food insecurity. In Dominica, food production systems are highly sensitive to acute and slow onset effects of climate change. The agricultural sector has a high level of exposure and sensitivity to climate risks, including temperature and precipitation variability and extremes, hurricanes, flooding, drought, sea level rise, and soil erosion. Drought, which can lead to decreased plant health and crop losses, is a major concern for the agricultural sector [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In 2010, a drought caused losses of 18% of the country’s GDP due to the negative impact on agricultural production [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Crop disease and pest outbreaks have already been observed in the country, leading to the decreased quality and productivity of some types of crops [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Small-scale coastal fisheries in tropical regions have been identified as particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Limited studies have been conducted on the health implications of climate change impacts on Dominica’s fisheries sector, although it is an area of increasing concern, especially given the increasing reliance on fisheries production to make up for losses in the agricultural sector.
