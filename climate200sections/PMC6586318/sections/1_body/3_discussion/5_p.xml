<p>Predictive provenancing is a relatively new approach to the issue of revegetation and restoration in a changing climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The approach matches provenance study results with species distribution models to identify seed sources best-suited for future conditions. While provenance data are available for only a handful of Hawaiian plant species, predictive species distribution models are available for most plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Comprehensive provenance trials are important for guiding restoration practice, but are not practical investments for the needs of most land managers. General guides outlined by Breed et al. [
