<p>While overall high seedling survival rates during this study suggest that seedlings can survive in highly exposed conditions despite provenance, invasive species removal efforts were required to reduce competition. A suite of aggressive invasive plants such as matt-forming grasses and bull thistle (

Introduced pasture grasses present perhaps the most pervasive obstacle to restoration of many native ecosystems in Hawaiâ€˜i as in other locations [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] suggests that while climatic conditions of tropical montane forests will shift upward in elevation, the upslope movement is much less dramatic than previously reported; continued invasion and land use activities may remain the most significant obstacles to restoration success. Quantifying invasive plant regrowth for inclusion as a model predictor may provide understanding of competitive effects on survival and growth in similar future efforts.
