<p>Most of the variation between sites may have been captured by the measurements of temperature range and moisture, both of which influenced seedling survival. Survival models for

 <italic>viscosa</italic> indicated that microclimate conditions at highest elevation locations were unfavorable generally, despite origin. Survival was similar across plots for

 <italic>chrysophylla</italic>, the dominant subalpine tree species, for plants of both origins. In a meta-analysis by Leimu and Fischer [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], distance and habitat variability were not demonstrably influential in reciprocal planting experiments; population size of origin plants was the strongest predictor of provenance-trial success. We documented results along a similar vein: despite dramatic environmental differences in seed origin, factors influencing seedling survival acted in the same direction for each species, albeit with varying magnitudes of effect in some instances.
