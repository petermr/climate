<p>Organisms that cannot disperse or adapt biologically in situ to rapid environmental changes may decrease in distributional range and abundance. Fragmented forest habitats may have little gene flow due to limited seed dispersal, further reducing speciesâ€™ ability to adapt naturally. One potential management approach is to transplant conspecifics from low-elevation locations to higher-elevation zones. Translocating species to higher-elevation zones may encourage evolutionary change by moving climate compatible variants to more appropriate zones faster than they can disperse naturally [

Alternatively, moving conspecifics downslope may enhance survival, as plants may track climatic water balance from moister air at warmer temperatures. Correctly predicting suitable climatic conditions for plant populations is critical for maximizing restoration and revegetation efforts.
