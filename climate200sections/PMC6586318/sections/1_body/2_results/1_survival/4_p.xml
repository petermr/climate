Soil moisture and elevation were inversely related to seedling survival with seedlings at lower elevation having a 64% greater probability of survival, with an even lower survival probability for seedlings from low-elevation origin planted at high elevations. Initial height increased seedling survivorship probabilities by 95%, and increasing range of temperature by 66% (w
