<p>We collected seeds from approximately 10 plants of eight native tree and plant species in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve (high elevation), and the Piha and Laupahoehoe Sections (low elevation) of the Hilo Forest Reserve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218516.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Approximately 8,000 seeds were collected and sent to Maui Native Nursery, LLC for propagation in June 2015. However, only three species were successfully propagated:

 <italic>oahuense</italic>, 
 <italic>Dodonaea</italic>. 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sophora</italic>.

 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>, and instead were collected from a similar elevation (1900 m asl), but from an area with climate conditions similar to the high-elevation seed source. No aspect of this study involved protected or endangered species.
