<p>Predictors included in mixed model analyses for both the growth and survival models were the same: plot as a random effect, seed origin (high or low elevation), plot elevation, temperature range (maximum–minimum values), and mean monthly soil moisture. Monthly minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures, mean monthly relative humidity, and seedling distance from origin as well as several interactions were considered, but not included as model parameters after correlation tests. Mean temperature and relative humidity lacked variation between plots and were eliminated as model predictors. We used Pearson’s correlation statistic to assess relationships between continuous predictors, and removed several to reduce collinearity. Elevation by origin and distance from origin were strongly correlated (r = 0.77–0.83 for all categories). We eliminated distance from origin from further model efforts in order to more explicitly assess origin along the elevation gradient. Minimum temperature was eliminated from consideration due to its strong negative correlations to elevation (r = -0.77) and temperature range (r = -0.68). Maximum temperature was eliminated as a factor due to a high correlation with temperature range (r = 0.91). We retained temperature range to serve as a proxy for exposure. There was a moderate negative correlation between elevation and soil moisture (r = -0.62). Values for microclimate variables were assigned based on the time period an individual seedling was in the ground, i.e., plants that died between the June and July measurements were assigned an average of the variable using March‒June data, while those surviving the duration of the experiment were assigned data from March‒July.</p>
