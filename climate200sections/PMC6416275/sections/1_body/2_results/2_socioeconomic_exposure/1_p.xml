<p id="Par11">Translated to socioeconomic impacts, 0.25–2.00 m of SLR alone (no storm) equates to the flooding exposure of between 37,000–406,000 residents (uncertainty range = 23,000 to 729,000 residents) and 13,000–357,000 employees (uncertainty range = 7,000 to 593,000 employees) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Data). However, with the addition of a 100-year storm to 0.25–2.00 m of SLR, these values increase to 155,000–612,000 residents (uncertainty range = 95,000 to 1,017,000 residents) and 86,000–534,000 employees (uncertainty range = 43,000 to 798,000 employees). For 0.25 m of SLR, the 100 year-storm compared to the no-storm scenario increases the residents and employees at risk by 322% and 576%, respectively, and 51% and 50% for the 2.00 m SLR scenario. While the percentages are smaller at the higher rates of SLR, the absolute number of population affected and economic impacts is far greater than for the lower SLR rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The relative increases in population exposure when including dynamic water level components from the annual to 100-year storms are 16–67% for 0.50 m SLR, 16–54% for 1.00 m SLR, and 19–51% for 2.00 m SLR.
