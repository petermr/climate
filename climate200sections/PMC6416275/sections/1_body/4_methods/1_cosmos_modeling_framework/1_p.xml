 <sup>st</sup> century climate change scenarios derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref.

 </sup> global wave model (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A higher resolution Eastern North Pacific WWIII model is nested within the global WWIII model to produce 21
 <sup>st</sup> century wave conditions at the edge of the continental shelf driven by winds from a single GCM (i.e. GFDL-ESM2M) and the RCP 4.5 climate scenario

 </sup> across the shelf and at the coast. Grids at a resolution of ∼10–20 m simulate overland flows in complex coastal settings, such as along the margins of estuaries, harbors and river mouths. Along the exposed open coast, XBeach

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>
 </sup> profile models, with a cross-shore resolution of 5 m at the shore, are applied every 100–200 m in the alongshore direction to simulate event-driven shoreline change, wave set-up, and swash (i.e. run-up). In contrast to SWAN, the XBeach model computes wave set-up and swash from both incident and infragravity wave energy, the latter which is a dominant component of storm-driven water levels on dissipative beaches
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Open boundary conditions for the XBeach models consist of time-varying Jonswap wave spectra and variations in water level due to tides, storm surge, and sea level anomalies extracted from the SWAN and DELFT3D-FLOW models along the 10 to 15 m depth contour. To include appropriate river discharge that may occur during the coastal storm events, river discharge rates are estimated from the atmospheric pattern in a given storm event and are included as point source discharges in the DELFT3D-FLOW model

 </sup>. Predicted flood levels are interpolated onto regularly-spaced grids and subtracted by a 2-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) to isolate areas that are not hydraulically linked to the ocean but were incorrectly flooded in the coarser-resolution numerical model. The DEMs were developed using nearshore multibeam bathymetry soundings and topographic LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data

 </sup>, providing a seamless elevation surface for the numerical hydrodynamic flood models. The DEMs also provide the initial geomorphic conditions for the long-term coastal change models (described below) that are integrated into the flood projections.
