<p id="Par18">Notably, for any of the socioeconomic factors, the relative increase in storm-related flooding exposure under the lower SLR scenarios is greater than at the higher SLR scenarios, as storm driven water levels represent a larger percentage of the total water level in the former case. For instance, there is a nearly 7-fold increase (576%) in the number of employees exposed to flooding with 0.25 m of SLR at the 100-year storm versus no storm; this is in comparison to only a 50% increase at 2.00 m of SLR. Similarly, with only 0.25 m of SLR projected to occur by ~2040, the number of residents exposed to flooding from an annual storm is expected to double compared to year 2000, and increase five-fold for 0.5 m of SLR. Although the net number of people impacted with 0.25 m of SLR is less than those impacted with 2.00 m of SLR, emergency managers do not currently plan for increases of this magnitude. Local hazard mitigation plans – the main planning documents that outline a municipality’s strategies to reduce risk to natural and man-made hazards – generally only forecast out 25–30 years (with updates every 5 years) and until recently have generally been based on historical and current day exposure. Although there are examples of emergency managers in California that are incorporating projections of the 100-year storm in tandem with SLR

 </sup>, many still do not and they therefore underestimate their community’s risk, particularly under low rates of SLR.
