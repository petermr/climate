<p id="Par16">Along the vulnerable shoreline of San Francisco Bay, which accounts for two-thirds of the flooding impacts projected for California, building defenses to withstand 2.00 m of SLR and a 100-year storm could cost up to $450 billion, almost twice the cost of defending against SLR alone

 </sup>. There is also a non-linear increase in costs to defend against the higher SLR projections, as costs are approximately 3-4 times higher for the 2.00 m SLR scenario as compared to the 1.00 m scenario. This highlights the need for the continual effort of scientists to improve estimates of 21
 <sup>st</sup> century SLR curves.
