<p id="Par5">The overarching concept of CoSMoS is to use a suite of linked oceanographic and geomorphic models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) to assess flood impacts caused by future SLR and storms at management-relevant scales (2 m resolution). CoSMoS utilizes projections of global climate patterns over the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century from Global Climate Models (GCMs) developed for the 5
 <sup>th</sup> Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
 <sup>

 </sup> to determine regional oceanographic conditions. Native resolution GCM projections are dynamically downscaled to the regional and local level and used as boundary conditions for a number of physics-based, numerical ocean models to predict coastal waves, water levels, flooding, and erosion for the range of possible SLR (10 scenarios: 0.00–2.00 m in 0.25 m increments, and 5.00 m, relative to the year 2000) and storm scenarios (4 scenarios: average daily conditions [i.e. including tides and typical wave conditions] and annual, 20-year and 100-year storms) over the 21
 <sup>st</sup> Century (Fig.
