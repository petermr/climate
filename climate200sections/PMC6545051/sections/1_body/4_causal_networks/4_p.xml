<p>The expression (5.2) is thus a 
 <italic>truncated factorization</italic> of the expression (5.1) for the unconditional probability, representing a blend of probabilistic and deterministic factors. Multivariate storylines can be treated by repeated application of this procedure. In this way, storylines can be cast within the context of a probabilistic framework.
