<p>The challenge for regional climate change science then becomes that of constructing suitable causal networks. Causal networks are necessarily a simplification, because they entail the reduction of continuous fields to a finite-dimensional system. However, they very much correspond to how climate scientists reason. For example, the El Niño variability in tropical sea-surface temperatures drives a Rossby-wave teleconnection pathway which affects circulation and weather regimes in the mid-latitudes, and all these elements can be represented to a reasonable extent with physical climate indices. Thus, atmospheric dynamics already provides the building blocks for the construction of causal networks relevant to regional climate risk. (In practice, the ‘dynamical conditions' node in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F4">figure 4</xref> could be expanded into a subnetwork.) Comprehensive climate simulation models are still needed to explore uncertainty space, but causal networks can provide the diagnostic framework within which to extract the relevant climate information from those simulations, and combine it with other sources of information in a format that is suitable for decision-making.
