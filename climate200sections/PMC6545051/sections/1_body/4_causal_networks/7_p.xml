<p>Interestingly, imposing a global-mean warming target builds in a relationship between the climate sensitivity 
 <italic>S</italic> and the climate forcing 
 <italic>F</italic>. This is in contrast with the traditional scenario-driven formulation of climate risk, where these quantities are treated as independent. [In (5.3), 
 <italic>S</italic>, as a property of the climate system, would be assumed independent of 
 <italic>F</italic>.] Such a relationship expresses the policy-relevant information that society will need to act more aggressively on controlling emissions if climate sensitivity turns out to be high, but may allow itself more time if climate sensitivity turns out to be low.
