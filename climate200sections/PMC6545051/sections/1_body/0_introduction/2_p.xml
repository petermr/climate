<p>Although there is high confidence in thermodynamic aspects of climate change (global warming, sea-level rise, atmospheric moistening, melting of ice), the levels of confidence concerning dynamical aspects of climate change, such as the location and strength of storm tracks, are much lower [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. None of the three key lines of evidence used in climate change science—predicated by accepted theory, detected in observations and consistently represented in climate models—applies to aspects of climate change that are closely related to large-scale atmospheric circulation. This includes, notably, mean precipitation changes over many of the most populated regions on Earth (
