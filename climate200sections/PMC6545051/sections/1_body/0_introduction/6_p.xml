<p>It is first shown (ยง2) how the standard, confidence-based framework for the construction of climate information prioritizes reliability (the avoidance of type 1 errors, or false alarms) over informativeness (the avoidance of type 2 errors, or missed warnings), and thus has ethical implications. It follows that there is no such thing as value-free climate science. In ยง3, the difference between epistemic and aleatoric (random) uncertainty is shown to be critical to the treatment of climate risk. Since epistemic uncertainty is deterministic and inherently subjective, it follows that there is no objective basis for a probabilistic approach, and no such thing as objective climate information. This motivates a reframing of the climate risk question from the ostensibly objective prediction space into the explicitly subjective decision space (ยง4). Finally, it is shown in ยง5 how such a reframing can be cast within the mathematical framework of a causal network, thereby reconciling storyline and probabilistic approaches.</p>
