<p>To return to Kuhn [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the construction of regional climate change information is not most usefully viewed as a search for an objective truth, but rather as a search for more complete descriptions of the realities that people have experienced and may experience in the future, and how those depend on contingent factors that are under human control. Kuhn's version of the Bayesian perspective described above, and the cutting of the Gordian knot it enables, is as follows [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, p. 170]: ‘If we can learn to substitute evolution-from-what-we-know for evolution-toward-what-we-wish-to-know, a number of vexing problems may vanish in the process’. The role of climate scientists is to bring physical knowledge of the climate system into such an enterprise.
