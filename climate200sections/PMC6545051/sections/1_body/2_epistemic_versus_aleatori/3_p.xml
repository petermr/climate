<p>We first discuss the uncertainty arising from internal variability, since it is conceptually much easier to deal with. Internal variability is a property of the physical climate system, whose random character arises from the chaotic nature of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, and which can be characterized from observations. Indeed, the definition of climate includes internal variability, which is characterized through statistical measures such as variances and covariances of physical fields, as well as higher order moments such as skewness or extremes, and includes coherent modes of variability such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The uncertainty from internal variability is fundamentally irreducible (leaving aside the possibility of finite-time prediction from specified initial conditions), and users of climate information need to understand that the mantra of ‘reducing uncertainty’ is inappropriate in this case; rather, the scientific goal is to better quantify the uncertainty. The magnitude of the uncertainty for any particular quantity can be reduced by taking coarser spatial and temporal averages, but that operation changes and may simultaneously reduce the value of the information provided.</p>
