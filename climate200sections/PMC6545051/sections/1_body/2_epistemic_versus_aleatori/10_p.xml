<p>The essential point is that epistemic uncertainties are deterministic, which means that they introduce correlations; unless those correlations are accounted for, inferences may be flawed. For example, Madsen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] show that the spread across Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model projections in temperature and precipitation changes at the gridpoint scale is significantly exaggerated when treating the gridpoints independently, as compared with when the models are ranked by the global-mean changes (where the spread comes mainly from climate sensitivity). This illustrates the general point that, with an inhomogeneous distribution of estimators, one should examine the distribution of responses to a perturbation rather than the overall response of the distribution to the perturbation.
