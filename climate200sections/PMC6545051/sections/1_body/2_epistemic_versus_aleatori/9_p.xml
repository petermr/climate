<p>A related issue is apparent in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F1">figureÂ 1</xref>. Because precipitation increases in some regions and decreases in others, the multi-model mean change inevitably passes through zero, and will be small compared with internal variability on either side of that line. However, that does not mean that the change in those regions can be expected to be small compared with internal variability; it just reflects uncertainty in the sign of the change. When there are equally plausible futures that point in different directions, averaging those futures buries relevant information and underestimates risk.
