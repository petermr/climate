<p>That an aleatoric interpretation of multi-model ensembles can blur the climate information contained within those ensembles is not difficult to appreciate. Circulation aspects of climate are related to features such as jet streams. Over Europe during wintertime, some models show an increase in jet strength under climate change and others a decrease (see fig. 4 of [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]); moreover, the location of the changes varies between models. While all models predict a significant jet response somewhere, averaging over the models will lead to a washed-out response. Thus, the multi-model mean may not only be unlikely, but even implausible. The situation is analogous to the idealized case of a bi-modal probability density function, whose mean may not be a physically realizable state.
