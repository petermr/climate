<p>As an example of the latter, Deser 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] estimate that, for NH wintertime mid-latitude surface pressure (whose spatial gradient provides an indicator of circulation changes), ensemble sizes of around 30 are generally needed to determine the forced decadal changes of a given model over a 45 year period. This is in striking contrast to surface temperature changes, where the signal-to-noise ratio of the forced response is much larger, and even single simulations can be informative. One might be tempted to think that if such a large ensemble size is needed to detect the signal, then the signal must be small. However, Deser 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] show that such a change in surface pressure patterns can alter the risk of regional drought or heavy precipitation by a factor of two, which is hardly negligible. Most climate model simulations are performed with much smaller ensemble sizes, although there is a growing interest in large single-model ensembles in order to better characterize the epistemic uncertainty within current models.
