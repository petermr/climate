<p>It would seem entirely appropriate to preferentially guard against type 1 errors when making high-level definitive statements concerning global climate change such as ‘Warming of the climate system is unequivocal’ [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, p. 4]. However, the framework is not so evidently appropriate when it comes to regional aspects of change (see also [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). This situation seems to be an example of Kuhn's [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, p. 37] important observation that ‘a paradigm can … insulate the [scientific] community from those socially important problems that … cannot be stated in terms of the conceptual and instrumental tools the paradigm supplies'. Thus, it is imperative to find alternative paradigms.
