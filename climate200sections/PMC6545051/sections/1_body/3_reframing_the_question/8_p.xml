<p>That there is relevant information concerning climate risk contained even in single historical events is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F3">figure 3</xref>, which shows a small region in central France during one day in August 2000 and another day in August 2003 during the severe heat wave that affected Europe that summer [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. From a statistical perspective, it may seem meaningless to compare two single days because they will each be strongly influenced by synoptic variability. However, the images show that the crops and grasses in the agricultural plots died out during the 2003 heat wave, and the surface temperature difference between the 2 days over those parts of the scene was 20°C, versus only 11°C in the forested region. Since a difference of 9°C over a distance of several hundred metres cannot be explained by synoptic variability (which has much larger correlation scales), this clearly shows the impact of land cover on the climate risk from heat waves. (Moreover, the average temperature difference in the agricultural plots rises to 24°C if the hedgerows are excluded, and the temperature difference in fields that were bare in both 2000 and 2003 is 11°C.) While it may not be possible to predict the future statistics of heat waves in this region, it is possible to make informative statements about how those heat waves would be affected by land cover and thus inform adaptation strategies.
