<p>If the construction of regional climate information inevitably involves ethical choices, then those choices should be made by the users of the climate information, based on their values. If the uncertainties in the climate information involve a significant epistemic component, then subjectivity is inevitable and the epistemic uncertainties similarly need to be understandable and assessable by the users of the climate information, within their particular context. Both imperatives move the climate risk problem outside the domain of pure climate science. Moreover, the recognition that epistemic uncertainties are deterministic removes the impulse to provide probabilities, which can give the illusion of objectivity and thereby reduce transparency. Instead, epistemic uncertainty can be represented through a discrete set of (multiple) storylinesâ€”physically self-consistent, plausible pathways, with no probability attached [
