<p>Rather than asking what will happen (as in the traditional, scenario-driven approach), which we may not be able to answer with any confidence, storylines allow us to ask what would be the effect of particular interventions—e.g. different climate forcing scenarios, or different adaptation measures—across a range of plausible futures. The latter questions are in any case the societally relevant ones. This reframing of the climate risk question from the prediction space to the decision space avoids the confidence straightjacket. Storylines have much in common with scenario planning and other methods of robust decision-making under uncertainty [
