<p id="Par24">Selection and trait change in our analyses were measured at the phenotypic and not the genetic level. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the adaptive phenological responses were due to microevolution or adaptive phenotypic plasticity, nor their relative contributions. Further insights would require differentiating between genetic and environmental components of the phenotype and how each relates to the fitness of individuals

Further, our analyses are correlative and we cannot rule out the possibility that the presumed effects of temperature are in fact due to other or additional environmental variables that correlate with climate, or that selection estimates are biased by environmental correlations between trait and fitness
