  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>, mammals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>). Indeed, we found that the association between morphological traits and temperature tends to differ among taxa, with only mammals showing a clear negative association. This finding contrasts with a lack of relationship between temperature and morphology reported for mammals by Meiri et al.

 </sup>, potentially because their study periods were longer than ours, and they used a different morphological measure (condyle-basal length). Although our PRC dataset is not exhaustive, our findings of variation among taxa in both phenological and morphological responses highlight the importance of collecting observations on a wide range of taxa.
