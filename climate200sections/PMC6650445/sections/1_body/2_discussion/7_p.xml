<p id="Par27">The assembled PRCS dataset suggests several avenues for further research. For example, currently underappreciated effects of climatic variation on traits and, in turn, on fitness and population viability may be pronounced

 </sup> and our datasets could be used to investigate them. Further, extending this dataset to incorporate vital rates and, ideally, population growth rate would allow for the mapping of environmental changes onto demography via phenotypic traits

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
