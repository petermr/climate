<p id="Par23">To assess the extent to what animals are able to track climate change, we here used an approach based on selection differentials by testing whether selection over time is significant across studies, and whether it is aligned with the direction of the phenotypic change over time. Alternative approaches exist, for example, the velocity of climate change can be used to assess the expected phenological change that is required to track climate change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. This approach allowed the authors to demonstrate that, in general, faster phenological shifts occur in regions of faster climate change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Although it would be insightful to compare the results obtained with the approach adopted here and the one based on the velocity of climate, this would only be possible for phenological, and not morphological traits.
