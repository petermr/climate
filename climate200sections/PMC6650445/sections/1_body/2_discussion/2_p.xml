<p id="Par22">Our findings of adaptive phenological responses to global warming in some bird species, reported here, should not be interpreted over-optimistically. Indeed, perfect adaptation would imply no selection and the significant directional selection observed across studies thus indicates that adaptive responses are imperfect, assuming selection estimates are not consistently biased, for example, see ref.

 </sup>. Furthermore, the lack of a temporal trend in the strength of selection means that, although populations are not perfectly adapted in their phenology, they are not getting more adapted or less maladapted over time as temperatures continue to rise. This result suggests that they are phenotypically tracking a shifting optimum, lagging behind at a constant rate, as predicted by BÃ¼rger and Lynch

 </sup>. Our comparisons of the actual vs. critical lags suggest that there is low but non-negligible probability that the degree of maladaptation is large enough for the majority of our study populations to be at risk. The actual risk of population extinction may in fact be larger because our estimations do not account for several sources of stochasticity

 <italic>Parus major</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyanistes caeruleus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ficedula hypoleuca</italic>, 
 <italic>Pica pica</italic>) for which collection of selection data is relatively easy. The generality of adaptive phenological responses among rare or endangered species, or those with different life histories, remains to be established
