<p id="Par53">The critical lag reflects a situation where the population can just replace itself (population growth 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 1) and comparison between the actual and the critical lag provides insight into the persistence of populations. If the actual lag is larger than the critical lag, then the population growth rate is lower than 1, implying substantial extinction risk. We therefore focused our numeric analyses on this difference between the actual lag and the critical lag. Note that this analysis relies on strong assumptions described in the original papers (e.g. heritability is considered in the estimation of the critical lag but not in that of the actual lag, and that the reverse is true for plasticity), but more accurate methods, for example, ref.
