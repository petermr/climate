<p id="Par40">To demonstrate general responses across species and locations, we require each of the three conditions necessary to infer adaptive responses to be met consistently across studies, for example, that, on average, temperature increased over time, warmer temperatures were associated with advancing phenology and advancing phenology corresponded to fitness benefits (i.e. negative selection on phenological traits given the two above-mentioned conditions are satisfied). To test for such general trends in adaptive responses across studies, we fitted three mixed-effects meta-analyses to the PRCS dataset, two for the first two conditions and the third to assess whether WMSD differed from zero. We tested the third condition in two ways. First, we performed a binomial test to compare the proportion of studies exhibiting adaptive (i.e. same sign for WMSD and the climate-driven trait change over time) vs. maladaptive (i.e. WMSD and the climate-driven trait change over time differ in their signs) responses to climate change. Second, we performed a mixed-effects meta-analysis similar to the three other ones.</p>
