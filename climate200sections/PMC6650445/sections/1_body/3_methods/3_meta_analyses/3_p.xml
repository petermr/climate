<p id="Par42">For each type of climatic variable (temperature and precipitation) in the PRC dataset, we fitted two mixed-effects meta-analyses, analogous to the mixed-effects meta-analytic models we ran on the PRCS dataset. With these meta-analyses we assessed whether across the studies (1) there was a directional change in the climatic values over time and (2) traits were affected by the climatic variable. As responses (i.e. effect sizes) in these models, we used the slopes extracted for each study from the respective mixed-effects models fitted analogously to those used for the PRCS dataset (see section above). For both morphological and phenological traits, we assessed whether the effect of climate on traits differed among taxa by including taxon as a fixed effect. For morphological traits, we also assessed whether the responses to climate differed among endothermic and ectothermic animals, by including endothermy as a fixed effect in the model.</p>
