 </sup>. Indeed, if species abundance increases over time, the probability of recording earlier events increases (especially if phenology is measured as the first occurrence date), meaning that species abundance can affect mean of the distribution of a phenological trait. For the same reason, the variance around the mean phenological response may be sensitive to population size, with higher variance at lower population sizes. To assess the sensitivity of our results to potential changes in population sizes over time, we fitted a heteroskedastic model in which population abundance was included both as a fixed-effect explanatory variable and as an explanatory variable for the model of the residual variance. This model is an extension of the models specified in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>) that were used to assess condition 2. This model was fit to each study for which abundance data were available and where the duration of the study was at least 11 years (28 out of 42 studies). The fitted model was:

To avoid overfitting, we refitted the same model without the AR1 structure and retained, for each study, the model structure leading to the lowest marginal AIC, analogously to how it was done for the models fitted to assess conditions 1, 2 and 3.
