<p id="Par46">One study in the meta-analytical models testing conditions 2 and 3 for phenology in the PRCS dataset appeared to be an outlier (ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
 </sup>, Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, we also re-ran the models without this study (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Additionally, the PRCS dataset contained mainly studies on bird species, and only one for a mammal species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>. To test how sensitive the results were to inclusion of this taxon, we re-ran the analyses after excluding the study for mammal species. The main findings were qualitatively unaffected by excluding either the only mammal study or an apparent outlier from the PRCS dataset, or both (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
