<p id="Par38">In the second step, to assess whether the response is adaptive, we considered WMSD in combination with the slopes obtained for the previous two conditions, as follows: we defined a trait change to be adaptive in response to climate if the climate-driven change in phenotype occurred in the same direction as linear selection. In contrast, if the climate-driven change in phenotype occurred in the direction opposite to selection, then the response was considered maladaptive. We measured the climate-driven change in phenotype as the product of the slopes obtained for conditions 1 and 2. A WMSD estimate of zero indicates a lack of selection

 </sup>. A WMSD of zero together with no trait change could indicate a stationary optimum phenotype, and a WMSD of zero together with a significant change in trait could indicate that a moving optimum phenotype is perfectly tracked by phenotypic plasticity (a negligible WMSD could also imply a flat fitness surface, i.e. no fitness penalty for deviating from the optimum). To assess whether the trait is adaptive, we plotted for each study the WMSD against the product of slopes extracted from conditions 1 and 2, which quantifies the observed climate-driven trait change over time (Fig.Â
