<p id="Par36">We assessed condition 2, the relation between the trait and the climatic variable, separately for phenological and morphological traits. For this, we fitted a mixed-effects model for each study with mean annual population trait values as a response and the climatic variable and the year as fixed effects. Year was included as a quantitative predictor in this model to account for the effects of variables other than the considered climatic variable, which had changed with time and could have affected the trait. Examples of such variables are any environmental alterations, such as land use change and succession but also other climatic variables, which potentially could have affected the trait, but for which we did not have data. In this model, we took into account temporal autocorrelation in the response variable and weighted the residual variance by the variance of the response variable (i.e. the reported squared SE of the mean annual population trait values) to account for between-year variation in uncertainty associated with mean annual population trait values. Prior to fitting the models we z-transformed trait values (i.e. subtracted the mean and divided by their reported standard deviation) to later compare the effect of the climatic variable on different traits. Accordingly, we also transformed the weights of the residual variance by dividing the reported SEs by the SD of the mean annual population trait values per study. The fitted model was:
