<p id="Par37">We assessed condition 3 of whether the trait change was associated with fitness benefits in a two-step procedure. In the first step, we fitted for each study an intercept-only mixed-effects model with annual linear selection differentials as a response. We allowed for temporal autocorrelation and weighted the residual variance by the variance of the annual linear selection differentials (i.e. the reported squared SE of the annual selection differentials). The fitted model was:

 </disp-formula>where Sel is the estimate of the yearly linear selection differential,

 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and following an AR1 model over years, and 
 <italic>ε</italic> is an independent Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance proportional to the estimated variance of the annual linear selection differential (which depends on

 <italic>α</italic> describes a non-zero mean of the autoregressive process. The predictions from the fitted model (Sel

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). The variance used in weighting is the prediction variance. The SE of the WMSD is deduced from these weights and from the covariance matrix of the predictions (see source code of the function extract_effects() in our R package ‘adRes’ for details).
