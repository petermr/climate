<p id="Par33">The remaining 33 publications from the originally selected 56 (58 with the shared unpublished data considered as two publications) did not report data on selection, but presented data on the annual values of climatic factors and mean population phenotypic traits, totalling 4764 studies that covered 1401 species. We retained these studies and combined them together with the 71 studies in the PRCS dataset to assemble the ‘PRC’ dataset (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">3</xref>). With the PRC dataset, we did not aim for comprehensive coverage of the literature published on the topic. Instead, we used this larger PRC dataset to verify whether the smaller PRCS dataset was representative in terms of climate change over time and trait change in response to a climatic factor. A flowchart showing the numbers of studies included at each stage of the systematic literature review is given in Supplementary Fig.
