<p id="Par31">To identify the studies satisfying the above-mentioned criteria, we searched the Web of Knowledge (search conducted on 23 May 2016, Berlin) combining the following keywords for climate change (‘climate change’ OR ‘temperat*’ OR ‘global change’ OR ‘precipit’), adaptation (‘plastic*’ OR ‘adapt*’ OR ‘selection’ OR ‘reaction norm’) and trait category (‘body size’ OR ‘body mass’ OR ‘body length’ OR ‘emerg* date’ OR ‘arriv* date’ OR ‘breed* date’). For taxa, we used broad taxon names in the first search (‘bird*’ OR ‘mammal*’ OR ‘arachnid*’ OR ‘insect*’ OR ‘reptil*’ OR ‘amphibia*’ OR ‘spider*’). Next, to increase the probability of finding the relevant papers, we run the search by using instead of taxa names detailed names below the level of the Class, as follows: (‘rodent*’ OR ‘primat*’ OR ‘rabbit*’ OR ‘hare’ OR ‘mole’ OR ‘shrew*’ OR ‘viverrid*’ OR ‘hyaena’ OR ‘bear*’ OR ‘seal*’ OR ‘mustelid*’ OR ‘skunk*’ OR ‘Ailurid*’ OR ‘walrus*’ OR ‘pinniped*’ OR ‘canid*’ OR ‘mongoos*’ OR ‘felid*’ OR ‘pangolin*’ OR ‘mammal*’ OR ‘bird*’ OR ‘flamingo*’ OR ‘pigeon*’ OR ‘grouse*’ OR ‘cuckoo*’ OR ‘turaco*’ OR ‘rail*’ OR ‘wader*’ OR ‘shorebird*’ OR ‘penguin*’ OR ‘stork*’ OR ‘pelican*’ OR ‘condor*’ OR ‘owl*’ OR ‘hornbill*’ OR “hoopoe*’ OR ‘kingfisher*’ OR ‘woodpecker*’ OR ‘falcon*’ OR ‘parrot*’ OR ‘songbird*’ OR ‘turtle*’ OR ‘tortoise*’ OR ‘lizard*’ OR ‘snake*’ OR ‘crocodil*’ OR ‘caiman*’ OR ‘alligator*’ OR ‘reptil*’ OR ‘frog*’ OR ‘salamander*’ OR ‘toad*’ OR ‘amphibia*’ OR ‘insect*’ OR ‘beetle*’ OR ‘butterfl*’ OR ‘moth*’ OR ‘mosquito*’ OR ‘midge*’ OR ‘dragonfly*’ OR ‘wasp*’ OR ‘bee*’ OR ‘ant*’ NOT (‘fish*’ OR ‘water*’ OR ‘aquatic*’)). These detailed taxon names were combined with the same keywords for climate change, adaptation and trait as before. Finally, we joined the unique records from each of these two searches in a single database.</p>
