<p id="Par29">We aimed at assessing adaptive phenotypic responses to climateÂ change across six broad taxa of animals: arachnids, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. We distinguished between two climatic variables: temperature and precipitation. We relied on the authors of the original studies for their expertise and knowledge of the biology of the species and system in the: (1) choice of the appropriate time window over which the annual means of the climatic values were calculated, rather than using a single time window for all species. For instance, if in a bird study the mean temperature over the 2 months preceding nesting was used as an explanatory variable for the timing of egg laying, we used this specific climatic variable; (2) choice of the specific climatic variables, be it air, sea surface or soil temperature, rather than using a single climatic variable across all species; and (3) choice of the spatial scale of the study, so that the measured variables were considered local at that scale. We focused on studies that recorded both changes of at least one climatic variable over time and changes in either morphological or phenological traits for at least one studied species. Phenological traits reflect shifts in timing of biological events, for example, egg-laying date, antler cast date or mean flight date in insects. Morphological traits reflect the size or mass of the whole body or its parts (e.g., bill length, wing length, body mass).</p>
