<p id="Par4">Longitudinal studies of wild populations provide the opportunity to determine whether phenotypic changes are adaptive (e.g. refs. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>). A phenotypic change qualifies as an adaptive response to climate change if three conditions are met: (1) a climatic factor changes over time, (2) this climatic factor affects a phenotypic trait of a species and (3) the corresponding trait change confers fitness benefits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. These conditions are usually assessed in isolation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> (but see, for example, refs. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>) and hence most studies can only speculate on whether adaptive responses have occurred. Here, we extracted data from many published studies to assess these three conditions in free-living animals and thus determine whether the observed phenotypic changes are adaptive.
