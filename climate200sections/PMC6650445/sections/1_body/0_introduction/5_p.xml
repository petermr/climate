<p id="Par7">We conducted a systematic literature search to assemble the necessary data to assess whether trait changes in response to climate change are adaptive across animal species worldwide. We mainly investigated the phenotypic responses of birds, because complete data on other taxa were scarce. We demonstrate that advancement of phenology is adaptive in some bird species, but this response is not universal. Further, modelling suggests that even bird species responding adaptively to climate change may adapt too slowly to be able to persist in the longer term.</p>
