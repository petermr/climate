  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, we did not find significant variation in phenological responses among different types of traits (categorized as arrival, breeding and development), either in the PRCS dataset (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">2</xref>, LRT between the model with and without the trait type as a predictor:

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5, df = 2,

 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.4, df = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.809). Our findings of advancing phenology with warming temperatures were qualitatively unaffected by including abundance, and, although abundance did affect phenological responses, the effects of temperature on phenology were generally larger than those of abundance (Supplementary Fig.
