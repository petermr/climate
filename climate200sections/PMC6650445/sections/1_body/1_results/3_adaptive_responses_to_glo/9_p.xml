<p id="Par19">For phenological traits, negative selection favouring the observed advancing phenology in the context of warming temperature suggests adaptive responses. Accordingly, in 23 out of 38 studies, phenology advanced over time as temperatures increased, and at the same time negative selection was acting on phenology (studies in quadrant III of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), suggesting adaptive responses. A binomial test revealed a tendency for phenological responses to be more frequently adaptive than maladaptive (mean proportion of studies with adaptive responses = 0.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The meta-analysis confirmed the direction of this effect (product of WMSD with the sign of the climate-driven trait change = 0.091 ± 0.068), although not reaching significance (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, LRT: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.9, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17), likely due to high heterogeneity among studies (Higgins 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup>, i.e. the proportion of total heterogeneity due to between-study variation was 0.999). For morphological traits, which have not changed much over time in response to climate, the proportion of adaptive and maladaptive responses did not differ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, binomial test, mean proportion of studies with adaptive responses = 0.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1).
