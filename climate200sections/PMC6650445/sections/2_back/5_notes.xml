 <p>The complete workflow implementing each step of the proposed framework (Fig. 
  <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is available as the R package ‘adRes’ (
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/radchukv/adRes" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.github.com/radchukv/adRes</ext-link>). The functions included in the package allow conducting the analyses as described in this study and can be applied to either the shared dataset that is included in the R package or to a new dataset formatted in the same way.
