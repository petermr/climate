 <caption> Adaptive and maladaptive responses to climate change. a, b Weighted mean of annual selection differentials (WMSDs) as a function of the climate-driven phenotypic change over time for a phenological and b morphological traits. The climate-driven phenotypic change over time is calculated as a product of the slopes from the first two conditions of the framework (the first slope reflects the change in temperature over time and the second slope reflects the change in traits with temperature). Roman numerals shown in red identify four quadrants. Points in quadrant I (upper right) and III (lower left) indicate studies for which phenotypic change over time occurred in the same direction as observed weighted mean annual selection differential, reflecting adaptive responses. Points in quadrants II and IV analogously indicate a maladaptive response. c Proportion of studies that showed adaptive and maladaptive phenological and morphological responses. Bars reflect 95% confidence interval (CI). We found a tendency for adaptive phenological responses and no evidence of adaptive responses in morphological traits.
