  <p>Trait changes in response to temperature. For each study in the phenotypic responses to climate with selection (PRCS) dataset, the changes in morphological traits are shown in grey and the changes in phenological traits are shown in black. Each study is identified by the publication identity, the trait and the species. Studies are sorted by trait category (black: phenological; grey: morphological), and within it by species, trait name and publication identity. Overall, phenological traits in both the PRCS dataset (black) and the PRC dataset (dark blue) were negatively affected by temperature. Morphological traits were not associated with temperature in the PRCS (grey) and showed a tendency to a negative association with temperature in the PRC dataset (cyan). In the PRC dataset there was significant variation among taxa in the effect of temperature on phenological (blue) traits, and a tendency to such variation for morphological traits (cyan). See Fig.
