<p>With accelerating frequency and intensity, severe storms, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather events are having ever-more evident impacts on human health and wellbeing. Among these impacts are heat-related illness, injuries and losses due to flooding; exacerbation of asthma, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions with air pollution; and growing risks of vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue, Lyme disease); water-borne diseases (diarrhea, cholera) and chemical pollutants; undernutrition; and forced migration [

 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These many impacts are unlikely to occur in isolation; combined and cumulative effects are likely. Research now indicates that many specific extreme weather events have been made more likely by global warming [

Recent record-breaking heat and precipitation and their impacts on human populations—e.g., 2017′s unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, or the deadly complex emergency of California wildfires and devastating heatwaves and flooding in India and Pakistan in 2018—led one veteran climate scientist to suggest that 2018 was the year the world woke up to climate change “not as a problem for future generations, but for us now” [

Also in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its stark report Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees, which makes clear the substantially higher risks to human populations of 2.0 °C compared to 1.5 °C of additional warming (the aspirational target of the 2015 Paris Agreement), and warns of the need for “rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, urban, infrastructure, and industrial systems,” including ambitious negative emissions targets [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. IPCC modeling indicates Earth may reach 1.5 °C of additional warming as early as 2030. Therefore, the coming ten-year period will be crucial for society’s dual challenges of decarbonizing the economy and preparing for more extreme climate conditions. Public health has a key role to play and must take on greater leadership in the decade ahead to achieve both of these goals.
