<p>Research over the last decade emphasizes that climate-related health outcomes are often affected (and sometimes even determined) by service quality in sectors other than health [

In particular, malfunctions of traditional built environment infrastructure (e.g., energy, transport, water and sanitation, and urban planning) can be particularly challenging through the cascading effects of one service on another, potentially causing considerable and often longer-term wellbeing impacts [
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For example, electric power outages in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 contributed to population health impacts through a variety of pathways, including curtailed hospital services, need to evacuate patients, inoperable pharmacies, and carbon monoxide poisoning with increased diesel generator use [

 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In a survey of over 300 world cities preparing climate action plans, Aylett found that most worked to break down sectoral silos through informal communication channels and formal institutions such as inter-departmental working groups [
