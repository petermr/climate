Austin et al. suggest three areas of partnership for health and climate governance: (i) coordination across different levels of government on health monitoring, diagnosis and policy implementation; (ii) collaboration of public health with non-health sectors, particularly to share health-related epidemiological, vulnerability, program monitoring and evaluation data; and (iii) partnerships with private and non-governmental organizations to implement programs to achieve specific health outcomes [
