 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03232-f001">Figure 1</xref>); it builds on the diagnosis from assessment, and encompasses identification and planning of actions that will be carried out and monitored in the assurance phase. Policy development involves not only government efforts to establish laws, regulations and procedures but also voluntary practices of private actors and efforts to communicate with the public. When integrated with the ten essential public health services in the context of climate change, policy development covers: (i) informing, educating and empowering populations toward climate resilience; (ii) mobilizing partnerships to anticipate and respond to health threats from climate change; and (iii) development of health policies that support climate mitigation and adaptation.
