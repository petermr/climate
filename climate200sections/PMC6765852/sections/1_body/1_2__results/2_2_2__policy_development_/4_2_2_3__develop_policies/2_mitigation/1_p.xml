<p>Substantial research over the decade has involved modeling and quantifying expected economic benefits related to population health from policies to reduce GHGs, particularly from power generation, transport, agriculture, household and industrial energy sectors [

 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Work examining energy supply and efficiency, active-transport and dietary change related co-benefits at regional, national and city level suggested that health benefits are likely to be important particularly for developing countries [

However, Workman et al. noted that health has been “elusive in its influence” on climate mitigation policy due to vested economic interests and structural political issues; to enhance impact of health on mitigation policy these authors recommend better aligning health co-benefits with renewable energy goals, identifying visible champions, and emphasizing health benefits in communications [

Reflecting the broader priority to identifying co-benefits—and making the link between health co-benefits and renewable energy—the Lancet Countdown included nine mitigation indicators in its list of global measures, including zero-carbon emissions electricity, exposure to ambient air pollution in cities, and premature mortality from air pollution by sector [
