<p>Some adjustments are needed to adaptation policy planning. For example, Hayes and Poland (2018) argue in particular for including mental health concepts more explicitly in health vulnerability and adaptation assessments [

Banwell et al. make the case that vulnerability and adaptation assessments are an opportunity to synergistically link disaster risk reduction and adaptation—through commonalities such as vulnerability targeting or use of early warning systems—and that public health has a key role in this important connection [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. However, Runckle et al. note that the public health community generally is unaware of the climate-related epidemiological and assessment tools available, in part due to lack of funding [

Reflecting some of these findings, the Lancet Countdown identified eight adaptation-related indicators for global monitoring including the number of national vulnerability and adaptation assessments, national adaptation plans for health, and city climate risk assessments, as well as amount of adaptation funding [
