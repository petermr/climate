<p>Nevertheless, despite this substantial progress, effective and harmonized climate-health surveillance remains a challenge. Moulton and Schramm [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] point out that US national and sub-national surveillance initiatives lack a shared conceptual framework and have focused mainly on indicator and data source development to the exclusion of systems and tools, capacity building, and supportive policies. At the global level, Ebi et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] point out the need for indicators of impacts and resilience of health systems, and the need for indicators that dynamically reflect changing risks and emerging adaptive solutions. Similarly, Erwin and Brownson [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] recommended a specific “policy” indicator for tracking the process, content, and outcomes of largescale changes. Important disease-specific data challenges also remain; for example, while monitoring of heat-related illness (HRI) has improved, Morano et al. identified the need to enhance ICD injury diagnosis and codes to improve HRI surveillance sensitivity [
