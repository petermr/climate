<p>Surveillance for infectious diseases is part of the standard public health toolkit. A decade ago, the challenge was seen as strengthening non-infectious climate-sensitive disease surveillance while harmonizing collection of exposure, vulnerability and surveillance data at similar temporal and spatial scales to support climate-adaptive responses. Modifying existing systems, such as the US National Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program was seen as a promising approach [

The climate focus of the EPHT Program has been revised to include twelve climate exposure indicators (including temperature distribution, historical heat and extreme precipitation data, and future heat and precipitation predictions); flood and heat vulnerability indicators; and health outcomes data [

 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] proposed a harmonized three-tiered approach to developing climate and health indicators that builds on such local surveillance. Other efforts have focused on targeted surveillance for specific diseases toward development of early warning systems (see Enforce Laws and Regulations, below), for example dengue fever in the European Union [

At the local level, the New Jersey Department of Health developed the first use of syndromic surveillance software to monitor severe weather-related outcomes such as carbon monoxide poisoning, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and disrupted outpatient medical care in the wake of Hurricane Sandy [
