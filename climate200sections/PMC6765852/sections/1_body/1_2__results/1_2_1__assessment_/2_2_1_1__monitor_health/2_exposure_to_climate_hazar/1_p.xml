<p>Recognition of the need for appropriately scaled climate forecasts to determine exposure to climate hazards was a key data concern a decade ago. Readily accessible “climate services” information—that is, climate and weather data along with their interpretation and downscaling to the local level—are essential to developing preventive climate-health policy responses. A major development toward this goal was creation in 2012 of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) led by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO); GFCS aims to improve meteorological information and targets public health among its key priorities [

Jancloes et al. noted progress in enhancing spatiotemporal resolution of this type of climate data, for example making it more relevant for weather-hazard early warning efforts (see Enforce Laws and Regulations, below), and more tangible for the public [
