<p>Ten years ago, the long-established public health roles of outbreak investigation and intervention were seen as critical in responding to the changing climate, while fine-tuning risk assessment methods was considered a pathway to addressing the challenge of attributing health outcomes to climate-related exposures and estimating burden of disease [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among key developments over the decade has been greater recognition of the dynamic nature of climate change risks to health, resulting in modifications to risk assessment frameworks to reflect complex systems thinking and Bayesian network approaches [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Another theme of assessment research has been the limitation imposed by the uncertain nature of the data used to predict health outcomes, related not only to climate parameters but also to demographic and socio-economic conditions, and adaptive factors such as financial and institutional capacity and community-level social capital [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Data and model uncertainty are ubiquitous challenges in the development of complex assessments in any context; as new data become available and experience is gained over time, uncertainty will be reduced. The public health challenge then becomes translating advances in knowledge from improved data and models into practical responses. Hess et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] recommended an approach that allows for dynamic adjustment to climate change hazards under conditions of uncertainty by incorporating learning into climate-related risk assessment. This “adaptive management” cycle starts with assessment, continues with planning, implementing, monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment, and then returns to assessment [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The CDC BRACE framework [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] uses this iterative approach, as does the EU Climate ADAPT framework [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and others. The Hess et al. adaptive management model evokes the cyclical nature of the core functions and essential services of public health model, but adds an adjustment step to reflect this dynamic uncertainty [
