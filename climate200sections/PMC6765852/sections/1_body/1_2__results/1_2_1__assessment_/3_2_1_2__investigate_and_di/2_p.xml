<p>Health Impact Assessment (HIA) has become an additional assessment tool to identify climate hazards and risks to health due to projects and programs being implemented across a range of non-health sectors. HIA’s five-step process—screening, scoping, appraisal, reporting, and monitoring [

 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], as well as to identify ways mitigation or adaptation activities may result in co-benefits to population health (see Policy Development, mitigation policy, below). Looking ahead, further development and use of the multi-sectoral approach encouraged by HIA represents an opportunity to identify tradeoffs and synergies in policy options (see Policy Development, mobilize partnerships, below).
