Public health agencies have traditionally enforced laws, regulations and other policy guidelines to protect population health. Important in the context of climate change, for example, are enforcement of safety regulations that protect from food- and water-borne disease (through restaurant licensing, food inspection and water sampling and testing); vector-borne disease management (through spraying to control mosquito populations). Risk of climate-sensitive diseases is projected to increase, with concurrent demand for enhanced public health services [

Increasing availability of climate services and modeling of relationships between weather parameters and disease (see Monitor Health, above) has facilitated development of early warning systems—for extreme heat, for example—which are becoming core responsibilities of many public health departments [
