<p>In a systematic review of 15 studies in the heat early warning system (HEWS) literature, Toloo et al. found evidence of their cost-effectiveness; these authors noted the importance of careful targeting to the most vulnerable and observed that costs of some adaptive actions (such as running air conditioners) were of concern [
