<p>Our review has several limitations. Our search was limited in scope (focused on review papers, two search engines) and language (English only), and therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all published literature that may be relevant when considering climate change and the ten essential public health service areas. However, we believe that focusing on English-language review papers has given us a representative summary of some of the major themes emerging over the last ten years for the purpose of stock-taking, which was our goal. The nature of the literature itself also presents limitations. Many reviews included in our paper noted that their findings were based upon studies in populations in North America, Europe or Asia, with a corresponding lack of studies in countries in Africa, Latin America and non-China Asia. For example, the review literature on heat early warning systems is largely based on evaluations in the US and Europe due to sparse evaluation studies in other regions. Yet an influential heat warning system in Ahmedabad, India, has recently provided evaluation experience from a low-income heat-vulnerable city [

It is a reality of the climate and health field that insufficient research attention has been focused on low- and middle-income populations, and on intervention evaluation more broadly. As noted above, we join other researchers in recommending this be remedied through shifts in research priorities [

 <xref rid="B131-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. The core functions and essential services model was developed in the US based on the American public health system, which inevitably differs from public health systems in other countries and regions. We nevertheless believe that the CFES model has broader generalizability to other settings, and that therefore our review may be relevant not only to the American public health system but also potentially beyond the US public health context.
