<p>To assess TSC, we employ GCM ensembles, which contain idealized experiments of the evolution of the climate system under prescribed emissions trajectories. Because GCM ensembles include simulations from multiple GCMs, they allow us to quantify uncertainty in future climate change due to internal variability of the climate system and model uncertainty (Deser et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Thompson et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). To estimate TSC, certain characteristics are required. First, GCMs must be forced by an emission scenario that results in increasing GHG concentrations until a certain time, followed by constant GHG concentrations. Second, after GHG concentrations are held fixed, GCMs must continue to be run for at least another century, preferably longer, in order for the climate system to adjust to a near‚Äêstable warming rate. And third, there must be a sufficiently large number of ensemble members available in order to robustly define uncertainty in the particular ensemble.
