<p>The CMIP5 and CMIP3 archives contain three GCM “constant composition commitment” experiments that emulate the stabilization of GHG as described above (Meehl et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Meinshausen et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In the CMIP5 experiment, GCMs are forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) from 2005 to 2150, after which point the GHG composition of the atmosphere is held constant and models are run out to 2300 (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58884-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In the CMIP3 experiments, GCMs are forced by either the SRES B1 or A1B emission scenarios from 2000 to 2100, after which point the GHG composition of the atmosphere is held constant and models are run out to 2300 (Meehl et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). For all three emission scenarios considered here, peak GHG concentrations occur at their stabilization values. Of the RCP4.5, A1B, and B1 experiments, we have obtained 10, 11, and 17 GCM simulations, respectively. TSC is estimated from mean annual surface temperature fields from these experiments (section
