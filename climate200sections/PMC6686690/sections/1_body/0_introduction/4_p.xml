<p>We define TSC as the time when the warming rate is undetectably different from that which we anticipate continuing for centuries (see FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="grl58884-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and section 
 <xref rid="grl58884-sec-0002" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). This demarcates the transition between the period of high transience in which rapid warming accompanies increasing GHG concentrations (Rogelj et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and the period of steady change in which constant GHG concentrations lead to a significantly reduced rate of sustained warming (Gillett et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
