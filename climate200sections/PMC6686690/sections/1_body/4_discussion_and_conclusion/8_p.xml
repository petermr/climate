<p>If the UNFCCC's objective of stabilizing GHG is achieved, then despite slower global warming rates our work suggests regional differences in the climate change trajectory in the coming centuries. An important limitation of our analysis is that TSC is estimated relative to 23rd century warming rates. This is because the ensemble simulations did not extend beyond 2300. It is possible that these rates will change in future centuries, which would result in later TSC values than the ones estimated in this analysis.</p>
