 <caption> The Time of Steady Change estimated using the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 ensemble. The color bar indicates the year in which the multimodel mean warming rate is within uncertainty of 23rd century warming rates. Line plots are as Figure  1c for selected 20° × 20° grid boxes. Note the relatively large uncertainties in model temperature change in the high‐latitude grid boxes relative to the low‐latitude grid boxes. An analogous figure with line plots showing warming rates as in Figure  1a is provided in the supporting information. </caption>
