 <caption> (a) Framework for estimating the Time of Steady Change (TSC) using the example of global mean surface warming rates from the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) ensemble. The solid red line indicates the multimodel median (MMM) warming rate over time, and the red‐shaded region indicates the range of uncertainty ( ±1 multimodel standard deviation). m max is the maximum warming rate in the 21st century. The dotted gray line is the MMM 23rd century warming rate ( m end) , and the gray‐shaded region ( ± ϵ) indicates one multimodel standard deviation around m end. The vertical line centered around the year 2127 is the estimated TSC as it coincides with the first of at least 20 consecutive years in which the solid red line falls within 1 ϵ  of m end . (b) The RCP 4.5 Fossil CO 2 extended stabilization emission scenario (Meinshausen et al., 2011). CO 2 emissions peak in the year 2040, and by mid‐22nd century they have reduced to below 1950 emissions values. (c) The RCP 4.5 MMM global mean absolute temperature change relative to 2201–2300 with ±1 multimodel standard deviation shown in red. The black dotted line indicates the MMM global mean temperature trend over 2201–2300, estimated using linear regression. </caption>
