<p>Explanatory power was weakest for models evaluating relationships between climate and the sex ratio of male to female migrants, in part because male and female abundances varied similarly with precipitation during the spring migration. Sex ratios of migrants in a given year are normally male-biased and represent an important proxy for the ‘skipping breeding’ behavior observed in females [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. There was substantial inter-annual variation in sex ratios (range: 1.56–2.59) resulting in fewer females (higher ratios) migrating during colder winters and wetter summers; the latter of which was observed in both the no time-lag and three-year time-lag analyses (
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, these responses appear contradictory; fewer females migrated during apparently unfavorable conditions in one instance (colder winters) and under apparently favorable conditions in another (wetter summers; [
