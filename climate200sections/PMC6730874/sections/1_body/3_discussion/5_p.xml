<p>The absence of long-term shifts in body size could be due to several alternative hypotheses. First, climate-induced changes of body size may be delayed by several years, especially when considering that size at metamorphosis is correlated to size at maturity [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Second, amphibian body sizes have also been shown to be density-dependent, suggesting that body sizes may be driven by relationships between resource availability and abundance [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, we found no significant time-lag effects and no relationships with the abundance of returning salamanders to support these hypotheses (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Third, we might not be adequately capturing demographic changes in the population that could mask climate-induced body size changes. The long-term increases in abundance may be a result of increasing survival and high breeding probabilities for young, small individuals that could also be affecting body size patterns [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The fourth hypothesis, which we provide support for below, is that another important climatic factor has additionally strong effects that is preventing a body size shift despite a prominent warming trend (
