<p>Three frequently documented ecological responses of ectothermic organisms to climate change are: 1) range shifts, 2) changes in phenology (i.e., migration timing), and 3) changes in body size [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As in previous studies, we observed year-to-year variation in the migration timing and body size of spotted salamanders that was coincident with inter-annual variation in temperature and precipitation [

However, we did not observe long-term, climate-induced shifts in population characteristics or migration timing of this species across the 23-year study. The absence of climate-induced population changes reflects a lack of change in the seasonal climate conditions important for explaining this species population characteristics. Our results provide insight into why different studies reach different conclusions about amphibian responses to climate change [
