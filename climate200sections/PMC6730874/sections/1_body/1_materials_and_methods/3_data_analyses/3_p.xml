<p>We then used a series of generalized linear models (GLM function; R v. 3.2.3) and an information-theoretic framework [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] to evaluate the relationships between the population characteristics of migrating adult salamanders and seasonal climate conditions. We established a set of candidate models

Candidate models for all response variables were composed of 1) simple linear models with single climatic variables, 2) multiple regression models testing for two-way interactive effects for all variable combinations within each of the three ‘seasonal periods’ of interest (summer conditions; winter conditions; migration period conditions), 3) three multiple regression models testing for additive effects of all climatic variables within each of the three seasonal periods, and 4) a global model with additive effects of all seasonal variables combined.
