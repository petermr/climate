<p>Prior to performing analyses, we excluded one year of data (2012) from the 23-year dataset due to insufficient data collection. Hence, results documented hereafter for population size, sex ratios, and migration timing includes 22 years of monitoring. Four other years were excluded for the body size analyses (1997â€“2000) because measurements were incomplete during those years. We evaluated the impacts of seasonal climatic conditions on three elements of spotted salamander population characteristics and two migration timing statistics. Population variables included 1) the total number of migrating salamanders, 2) the snout-vent length (SVL) of both male and female salamanders, and 3) male to female sex ratios. The migration timing statistics included 1) the 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentile migration start date for male and female salamanders and 2) the length of the observed migration window for males and females based on the respective starting and ending migration date for each sex. The starting and ending dates for male and female salamanders was based on the 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentile threshold defined above for the Spring migration period.
