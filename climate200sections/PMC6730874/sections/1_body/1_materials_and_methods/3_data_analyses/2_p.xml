<p>We used autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models to evaluate whether the salamander population characteristics (abundance, sex ratios, body size, migration timing) and seasonal climate variables have changed across time. ARMA models compute a moving average that can estimate trends for datasets even with years of missing data. Using year as a lone independent variable, we added an ARMA correlation structure to general least squares regressions (GLS function; R version 3.2.3; [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]) for all climate variables and population characteristics in order to account for the temporal autocorrelation commonly observed in time series data [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The parameters for each respective ARMA model (
