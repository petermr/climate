<p>Projected mean range shifts varied conspicuously among species but were consistent across different AOGCMs. Nearly half (or more) of the 1,205 species had a projected decrease in their geographic range (CCSM3 = 509 species; CSIRO = 509 species; UKMO = 628 species). For species projected to suffer a reduction in range size, unweighted mean losses were 49.6% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 16.2%), 49.7% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 16.1%), and 72.4% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 19.0%) of the current area under CCSM3, CSIRO, and UKMO AOGCMs, respectively.
