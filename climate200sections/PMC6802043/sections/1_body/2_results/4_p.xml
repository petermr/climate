<p>The weighted mean effect size 
 <italic>M</italic> (i.e., the difference between species potential distributions for baseline and future climates) was estimated to be −24.9% (95% CI = ±6.8%), −24.7% (±6.3%) and −42.6% (±17.2%) under CCSM3, CSIRO, and UKMO, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35617-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There was significant heterogeneity in all AOGCM, and the highest values of the heterogeneity (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) was due to between‐species differences (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35617-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). According to the coefficient

   <mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi>

  </msubsup>
 </math>, from 81.3% to 99.8% of the observed variance can be attributable to real differences among species in terms of geographic range shift (
 <italic>D
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>). From 65.9% to 74.3% of the observed variance in 
 <italic>D
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> can be due to real differences between species, and from 7.0% to 34.0% can be due to phylogenetic effects (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35617-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The high variability in the differences between potential distributions for baseline and future climates suggests that there is much scope for the study of correlates of range loss/gain due to climate change.
