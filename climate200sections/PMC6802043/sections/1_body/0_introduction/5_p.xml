<p>Here, we propose that the uncertainty of species' range shifts can be used as weights in a meta‐analysis. We exemplify our new approach using the estimated biogeographical range shifts of Neotropical birds to future climate change. Further, in a cross‐species analysis, we asked whether the weighted mean projected shift has a negative (loss) or a positive (gain of geographic range) signal. Finally, we tested the predictive ability of species‐specific biological traits as correlates of range shifts.</p>
