 <caption>
  <p>Variation of effects sizes among different atmospheric‐ocean global circulation models projections. The vertical solid line indicates effect size equal to zero, and the dashed line indicates the weighted effect size for each projection. Horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of each effect size. The size of each circle indicates the weight of each effect size for the weighted effect size calculation. Negative ES: effect sizes which the upper limit of 95% CI does not include zero; Positive ES: effect sizes which the lower limit of 95% CI does not include zero; Non‐significant ES: effect sizes which 95% CI includes zero. For simplicity, we omit six, five, and eight very imprecise effects sizes in “a”, “b,” and “c,” respectively</p>
