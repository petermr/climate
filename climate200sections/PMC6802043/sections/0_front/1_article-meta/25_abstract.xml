 <p>Different ecological niche models can lead to divergent expectations of climate change impacts in species range distribution. We show that weighting by ecological niche model precision can help to improve cross‐species range changes predictions. The variability in cross‐species expected range changes is more due to differences among species than among ecological niche models, which highlights that searching for species trait that may predict range changes can help to target conservation.
