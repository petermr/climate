<p>Chinese Values Changing Survey provided a starting point for the Study 3, which was conducted in October 2017. Because of our conceptualization of individualism–collectivism as an individual-difference variable, we only selected participants with extreme individualist or collectivist orientations for Study 3. Following a previously documented procedure (for greater detail, see 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Caldwell-Harris and Ayçiçegi, 2006</xref>), 227 participant candidates were picked and identified as either individualists (
 <italic>n</italic> = 96) or collectivists (
 <italic>n</italic> = 131) according to their initial scores on the individualism–collectivism measure.

 </sup> All participant candidates received an email inviting them to undertake the survey. In addition to the variables assessed in Study 2, the identical measure of individualism–collectivism was also included. A total of 156 surveys were completed and returned (67% response rate), with participants in both an individualist group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 62) and a collectivist group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 94). Therefore, the final sample of Study 3 consisted of 156 freshmen (43 women, 113 men), with a mean age of 18.85 years (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1.458). Participants received an honorarium of 30 CNY for participating in the study.
