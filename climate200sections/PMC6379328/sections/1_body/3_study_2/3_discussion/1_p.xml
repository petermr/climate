<p>Participants who had just been exposed to intractability-inducing information reported higher levels of perceived intractability of climate change than those exposed to neutral information, whereas the differences in other related variables (i.e., BCC, CCRP, and KCCA) between the experimental and control groups were not statistically significant. Moreover, participants in the experimental group were more likely than those in the control group to exhibit climate change inaction, i.e., being reluctant to perform climate-friendly action. Taken together, these results support our second hypothesis, which postulated that those who were reminded of the intractability of climate change would be less likely to take climate change action than those in the control condition.</p>
