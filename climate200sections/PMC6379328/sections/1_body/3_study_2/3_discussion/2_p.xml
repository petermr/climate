This finding further ruled out the possibility that perceived intractability may be used as self-justification by individuals to defend their inaction on climate change. Thus Study 2 provided the preconditions for Study 3, which examined the effect of individualistic/collectivistic status on climate change inaction and the mediation of perceived intractability.</p>
