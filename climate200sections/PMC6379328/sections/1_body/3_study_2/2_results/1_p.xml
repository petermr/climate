 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the descriptive statistics. An independent-samples 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was performed on PICC between the experimental and control groups. Consistent with the manipulation, there was a significant difference for PICC between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing higher scores:

 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> = -3.85, 95% CI = [-5.23, -2.46], Cohen’s 
 <italic>d</italic> = -0.82. Furthermore, the results showed that the CCI scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group [
