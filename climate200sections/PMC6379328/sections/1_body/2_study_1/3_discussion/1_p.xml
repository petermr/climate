<p>Since no study has been conducted so far to explore the relationship between CCI and PICC, Study 1 aimed to provide preliminary evidence for this issue. Clearly, the results of Study 1 showed that CCI, which is operationalized as a low frequency of climate-friendly action over the preceding 6 months, is significantly correlated with the level of PICC. This correlation remains significant even when we control for other related variables, such as BCC and CCRP. These findings support our hypothesis that climate change inaction is correlated positively with perceived intractability. However, it is still unclear whether an activation in PICC salience would result in CCI. We would like to further examine the causal effect of PICC on CCI experimentally. In addition, as CCI in Study 1 was operationalized as a retrospective evaluation of past behavioral patterns, such self-reported results may be swayed by recall bias whereby participants are indifferent to their past behaviors. Therefore, prospective intention (rather than retrospective frequency) relating to climate-friendly actions was used alternatively in Study 2. Another potential deficiency is the knowledge deficit, that is, participants do not know which daily behaviors are helpful in curbing climate change. This problem was avoided in Study 2 by assessing the participantsâ€™ knowledge of climate change action (KCCA).</p>
