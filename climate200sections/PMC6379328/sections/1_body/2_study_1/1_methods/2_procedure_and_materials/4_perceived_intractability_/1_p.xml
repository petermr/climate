<p>A 4-item Likert-type scale was developed to measure Perceived Intractability of Climate Change (PICC). PICC was operationalized with the following items: (1) my individual action would likely do little to aid the fight over climate change; (2) I can bring a fundamental change in climate change in everyday life; (3) climate change couldn’t be relieved by my day-to-day behavior; and (4) my daily action could have a positive impact on climate change. Participants were asked to answer on a 4-point scale from 1 (
 <italic>totally agree</italic>) to 4 (
 <italic>totally disagree</italic>). The second and fourth items were reverse-scored so that high scores represented a high perceived intractability. Cronbach’s α for this scale was 0.758.
