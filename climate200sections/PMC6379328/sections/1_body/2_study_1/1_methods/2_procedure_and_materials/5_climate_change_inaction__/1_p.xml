<p>Climate Change Inaction (CCI) was measured with one straightforward question: “How often, on a scale of 1 (
 <italic>not very often</italic>) to 7 (
 <italic>very often</italic>), have you taken some kind of action to combat climate change over the last 6 months?” The values were reversed so that high values represented high climate change inaction.
