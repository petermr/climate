<p>The means, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations of the variables are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We found that CCI was significantly related to PICC (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.476, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). That is, higher perceived intractability of climate change was related to lower frequency of climate-friendly behavior over the past 6 months. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between CCI and BCC (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.269, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), as well as CCRP (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.227, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
