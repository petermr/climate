<p>Using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, we tested our hypothesis that individuals who rated climate change as more intractable less frequently took climate-friendly action in the preceding 6 months. In the model, CCI was treated as the dependent variable, and BCC and CCRP were entered into the first block as control variables, and PICC score into the second block. The results (see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) indicated that CCI was significantly negatively related to BCC (β = -0.260, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and CCRP (β = -0.216, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The results also indicated that after controlling the effect of BCC and CCRP, the effect of PICC on CCI was still statistically significant (β = -0.151, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
