<p>Clearly, climate change inaction is not a homogeneous phenomenon, and hence investigating individual differences in climate change inaction should contribute to a better understanding of why and how this phenomenon occurs. Individualism–collectivism-based differences in pro-environmental behavior have been reported in earlier studies (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2013</xref>), which provided the impetus for this investigation of individualism–collectivism-based variations in climate change inaction. Consistent with existing findings, our results demonstrated that collectivist orientations may be more related to climate-friendly behaviors than are individualist orientations. Not only this, we further showed that these differences could be attribute to the perceived intractability of climate change. Extensive evidence indicates that our responses to climate change could be shaped by cultural orientations (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman, 2010</xref>) at both the attitudinal and behavioral levels. The significance of our results lies in the fact that they make a unique contribution to the existing knowledge about climate change inaction by showing that individualism–collectivism shapes barriers to perform climate-friendly behaviors.
