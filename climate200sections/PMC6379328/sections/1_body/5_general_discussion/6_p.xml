<p>Nevertheless, some aspects of the current research require further consideration. First, the measures of belief in climate change used in the present study have face validity, but the internal consistency was lower than optimal. Although belief in climate change was treated as an irrelevant variable, study results may still be swayed by this flaw, suggesting that our findings should be interpreted cautiously. Second, the individualism–collectivism orientation was examined only within Chinese cultural background. To generate more conclusive support for the individualist–collectivist differences in climate change inaction, research conducted in other cultural backgrounds or using a cross-cultural comparative approach is necessary. Third, another limitation of the present studies is that we used self-report measures rather than measures of actual climate change (in)action. For future research, it is worthwhile to examine climate change inaction with objective measurements related to a low-carbon lifestyle. Fourth, given that examining individualist–collectivist differences in climate change inaction was the original goal of the present research, an intervention study was not conducted. 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Meleady and Crisp (2017)</xref> redefined climate change inaction as temporal intergroup bias, and found that temporally adapted interventions for reducing prejudice may help elicit environmental protection. Similarly, future studies are expected to investigate how to encourage climate change action by overcoming the perceived intractability of climate change. Fifth, future studies could explore the boundary conditions of climate change inaction. Although, we distinguished intractability from helplessness, with an emphasis on the view that climate change is inherently intractable whereas helplessness may be a subjective experience concerning climate change, it is possible that perceived intractability make people feel helpless, which in turn results in climate change inaction. Therefore, it will be important to further explore the mediating role of helplessness in the relation between perceived intractability and climate change inaction. Moreover, the effect of perceived intractability on climate change inaction may be moderated by collective efficiency. Collective efficiency, people’s shared belief in their collective power to produce desired results (
