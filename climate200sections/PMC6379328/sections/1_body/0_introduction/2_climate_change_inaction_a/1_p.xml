<p>Though climate change inaction has appeared periodically in public discourse and scientific literature, a clear definition is still lacking. Roughly, any form of an actor’s inactive state in addressing climate change could be described as climate change inaction. The concept of “climate change inaction” is widespread in the environmental economic literature. This line of inquiry aims to calculate the cost of climate change inaction versus inputs caused by action on climate change (e.g.,

Recently, this concept was introduced into the field of environmental psychology in order to address the question of why we do not take action on climate change. Climate change inaction occurs at various levels involving individuals, businesses, and governments. Individual inaction on climate change may be manifested in indifference to climate change in daily routine, e.g., denying climate change as a vital issue (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Finke et al., 2016</xref>). Obviously, forms of climate change inaction intersect at different levels. For instance, governmental non-supportive policy will discourage companies’ investment in climate-friendly products, which will in turn foster consumers’ climate change inaction.
