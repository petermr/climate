   <p>Considering excessive carbon emission Is one of the larger contributors to climate change, it Is possible to lower carbon emission via reducing energy consumption in order to tackle climate change. According to a report published by the Global Carbon Project, global carbon emissions in 2013 reach a record high of 36 billion tons, and this number Is still growing. However, the amounts of carbon emissions reduced by a single individual seem to Be rather limited. for example, it Is estimated that if we Can decrease the time for having the television on by 1 h each day, the amount of carbon emission May Be reduced by 4.71 kg each month.</p>

   <p>Global warming Has Been identified as one of the most pressing issues human Is facing. Global warming occurs because of greenhouse gases effect, that is, atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (i.e., carbon dioxide) increases sharply due to human activities, and further absorb large amounts of the infrared radiation From the Earth, hence resulting in the rise of average global temperature. In order to obtain the energy, human burn fossil fuel such as oil, coal, and natural gas, which in turn emit an overwhelming quantity of greenhouse gases Into the atmosphere. Furthermore, forestsâ€™ role as absorbers of carbon dioxide Has Been impaired by large-scale deforestation.</p>
