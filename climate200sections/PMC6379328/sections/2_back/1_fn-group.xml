  <p>Similiar grouping procedures are common in research related to individualism/collectivism, especially those conduced within a single cultural background. In these studies, participants were artificially categorized as individualists or collectivists based on their scores on an instrument (e.g., 
   <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Liddell et al., 2015</xref>) or through individualism/collectivism priming (e.g., 
   <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Goncalo and Staw, 2006</xref>). Despite latent limitations, the individualism/collectivism dichotomy could methodologically avoid a situation in which individuals simultaneously exhibit individualist and collectivist orientations.
