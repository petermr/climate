 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. When species at a given elevation shift their geographic ranges upwards in response to increasing temperatures, species from lower elevations that are already adapted to higher temperatures could move in and replace the emigrating species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. These range shifts might cause species turnover that could buffer changes in species richness at the given elevational levels
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. At the lowest elevations in the tropical lowlands, however, upward range shifts and a lack of compensation by immigrating species might lead to a net loss of species richness, a process referred to as “lowland biotic attrition”
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. At the highest elevations, species face a different challenge since they are not able to move their ranges beyond the mountain top and hence might go extinct

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, other physical or biotic barriers (

 <italic>g</italic>., the tree line) could limit upward movements of species on mountains and cause species extinctions because these barriers might not necessarily shift upslope at the same pace

 </sup>. Beyond these general theoretical expectations, little is known about the potential changes in the composition of ecological assemblages along mountains in response to climate change.
