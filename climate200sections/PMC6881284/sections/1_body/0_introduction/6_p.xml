<p id="Par7">Here, we combine species distribution models (SDMs) with an analysis of functional diversity to assess the potential impact of future temperature and precipitation change on frugivore assemblages along an elevational gradient in the tropical Andes of southeast Peru. We focus on frugivorous birds because they are of key importance for the functioning of tropical forests, due their important role as seed dispersers

 </sup>, and because their functional traits related to foraging and seed dispersal (

 </sup>. Our approach comprises three steps. First, we derived projected frugivore assemblages by using species-specific SDMs based on mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation to model current and future occurrence probabilities of bird species on each of seven studied elevational levels. Second, SDM-derived occurrence probabilities were refined by four dispersal scenarios. These hypothetical scenarios included a 
 <italic>no range change</italic> scenario and three range change scenarios (
 <italic>range contraction</italic>, 
 <italic>range expansion</italic> and 
 <italic>range shift</italic>) which assumed that birds need to shift their lower and/or upper elevational range upslope to track their temperature niche

 </sup>. This is consistent with observed species responses to climate change in mountainous areas

 </sup>. Third, to assess possible changes in functional diversity under climate change, we calculated FDis as a measure of functional diversity, for current and projected future assemblages.
