<p id="Par8">We used the output from the climate-driven projection models to compare FDis values of current and future assemblages (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and to test the following hypotheses: (i) loss of FDis at the lowest elevation of the gradient, due to a decline in the number of functional specialists (

 <italic>e</italic>., species with a set of morphological traits that are distinct from the rest of the assemblage), (ii) little change in FDis at mid-elevations as the loss of emigrating species might be compensated by immigration of functionally similar species, and (iii) little change in FDis at high elevations because species extinctions might be functionally compensated by the immigration of species from mid-elevations. Our scenarios suggest that functional aspects of bird assemblages are likely to change differently in response to climate change at different elevations, potentially causing future changes in the distribution of functional diversity along tropical elevational gradients.
