<p id="Par9">Our study included nearly all frugivorous bird species (
 <italic>n</italic> = 232, 95%) that currently occur along the elevational gradient of the Manú biosphere reserve and covered an elevational range from 500 m (lowlands) to 3500 m (tree line), at 500 m intervals (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The highest number of species was found on the lowest elevational level (
 <italic>n</italic> = 139 at 500 m), followed by a continuous decrease of species richness towards higher elevations (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17 at 3500 m). Five species only occurred below 500 m and were therefore currently not represented in any of the seven analysed assemblages. A total of 52 species were restricted to the elevational level of the lowlands (
