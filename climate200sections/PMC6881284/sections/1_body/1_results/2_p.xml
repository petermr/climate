Mean annual temperature and precipitation were projected to increase under both RCP 6.0 (ΔT = 2.3 ± 0.06 °C, ΔP = 136.9 ± 94.81 mm/yr) and RCP 8.5 (ΔT = 3.3 ± 0.08 °C, ΔP = 166.1 ± 95.71 mm/yr). Mean annual temperature and precipitation were used to fit SDMs to predict the probability of occurrence of species at the spatial extent of whole South America and subsequently used to derive probabilities of occurrence on the local gradient (see Methods). SDMs performed generally well (prediction accuracy across all SDMs measured as true skill statistic = 0.87 ± 0.07). Based on these projections, we calculated FDis (weighted by SDM-derived occurrence probabilities) of projected future bird assemblages and compared these to the corresponding estimates from current assemblages for four different dispersal scenarios (
