<p id="Par11">In line with the first expectation, we found a loss of FDis in the lowlands (500 m) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This was largely consistent across dispersal scenarios and emission scenarios (RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, 500 m). The loss of FDis was due to a projected decrease in occurrence probabilities of species at the margins of the functional trait space (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and S3–5, 500 m).
