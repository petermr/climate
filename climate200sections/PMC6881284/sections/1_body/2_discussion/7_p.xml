<p id="Par20">In conclusion, we show that the combination of SDMs and functional dispersion as a measure of functional diversity is a promising way to study potential changes in the functional diversity of ecological assemblages under future climate change. While remaining correlative, our study suggests that FDis of bird assemblages at different elevations of tropical mountains could be affected differently by projected global warming. First, lowland assemblages might face a loss of functional diversity in the future because functionally specialized species appear to be more vulnerable to climate change than functional generalists. Second, assemblages at mid-elevations are likely to reshuffle in the future, which may lead to the immigration of functional specialists and a high species turnover in these assemblages which could buffer climate-change impacts at these elevations. Our findings are relevant for forest ecosystems along tropical mountains as the projected elevation-specific changes in frugivorous bird assemblages could have important feedbacks on seed dispersal and plant regeneration.</p>
