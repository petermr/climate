<p id="Par14">We combined SDMs with an analysis of functional dispersion (FDis, a measure of functional diversity) to explore how climate change might affect the functional diversity of frugivorous bird assemblages along an elevational gradient in the Andes. We found strong support for a reduction of FDis in the lowlands, a projected increase at lower mid-elevations, and little change at elevations higher than 2000 m. Under the assumption that climatic factors (especially temperature) are a major limiting factor for current and projected future occurrences of birds, these findings suggest that climate change has varying effects on avian functional diversity and associated ecosystem functions along tropical mountains.</p>
