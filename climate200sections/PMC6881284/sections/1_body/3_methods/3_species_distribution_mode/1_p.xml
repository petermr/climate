<p id="Par25">We used species distribution models (SDMs) to obtain the current and projected future probability of occurrence of the 232 bird species within each of the seven elevational levels of the Manú biosphere reserve. All SDMs were fitted on a spatial extent of continental South America to capture the whole climatic niche space of each species. Since spatial sampling bias (

 <italic>g</italic>., towards easily accessible areas or due to differences in sampling intensity among taxa) can affect the performance of SDMs, we minimized this effect by following the suggestions from Phillips 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> through restricting the background data to an extent with the same spatial bias as the pooled data of all species occurrences. Hence, we downloaded GBIF occurrence records for all bird species in South America and restricted the background to only those grid cells in which at least one bird species was observed. This resulted in a background of 34,297 grid cells (2.5 minutes resolution) across the entire extent of continental South America.
