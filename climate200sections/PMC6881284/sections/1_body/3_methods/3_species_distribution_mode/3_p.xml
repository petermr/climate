<p id="Par27">The best performing SDM was used to determine the probability that a species could occur on each of the seven elevational levels, under current and future conditions. To do this, we projected the SDMs (BIOMOD_Projection in “biomod2” package in R

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>) using the current local climate as well as the 10 projected future local climates (2080; RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 under five GCMs). We used the full continuum of occurrence probabilities and interpreted a low probability of occurrence of a species as indicating a low representation of its functional type in the respective assemblage. Hence, no presence/absence threshold was required in the analysis and species were weighted continuously by their current and projected occurrence probability.
