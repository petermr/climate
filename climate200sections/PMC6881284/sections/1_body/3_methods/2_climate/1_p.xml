<p id="Par23">Climatic data on mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation were compiled across South America (for fitting continental SDMs) and at the local level along the elevational gradient of the Manú biosphere reserve (for elevational level SDM projections). Mean annual temperature and precipitation for each of the seven elevational levels were compiled from literature

 </sup> and from local measurements by W. Farfan-Rios (elevation 3500 m) and C. Beirne (CREES, MLC, elevation 500 m). The use of local mean annual temperature and precipitation data was preferred over the use of global climate data since they were measured on site and therefore were not affected by interpolation between climate stations in mountainous areas.
