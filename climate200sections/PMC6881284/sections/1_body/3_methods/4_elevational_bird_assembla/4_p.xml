<p id="Par31">The future elevational ranges of species were subsequently calculated by adding the mean projected vertical distance per species to the lower and/or upper values of their current elevational range, according to the respective dispersal scenario (see Supplementary TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for current and projected future elevational ranges of all bird species). Future assemblages under the dispersal scenarios 
 <italic>range contraction</italic>, 
 <italic>range expansion</italic> and 
 <italic>range shift</italic> were subsequently derived by cropping the SDM-derived probabilities of occurrence of each species by the respective future elevational range of the species. Hence, if a species was projected to occur on an elevational level by its SDM, while the respective elevational level was not included in its future elevational range according to the respective dispersal scenario, the species was considered absent and its probability to occur was set to 0. Only under the scenario of 
 <italic>no range change</italic>, assemblages were directly defined by the SDM-derived probabilities of occurrence, according to the current elevational ranges of species.
