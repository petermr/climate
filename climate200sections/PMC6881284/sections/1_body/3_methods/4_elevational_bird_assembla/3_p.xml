<p id="Par30">To project future elevational ranges of species according to these dispersal scenarios, we acquired annual mean tropospheric lapse-rate values (

 </sup>. This lapse-rate raster was bilinearly interpolated to match the resolution of 2.5 minutes of the mean annual temperature (MAT) rasters and ranged between 6.17 °C/km and 6.22 °C/km. Following La Sorte &amp; Jetz

We then computed species-specific vertical distance as the mean across the vertical distance values of all elevational levels at which the respective species currently occurs. The mean projected vertical distance per bird species was calculated for the year 2080, two emission scenarios (RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) and five GCMs (CC, HE, MC, MG and NO). The mean vertical distance by which a species would change its elevational distribution to track its temperature niche, according to our projections, ranged between 290 m and 490 m under RCP 6.0 and between 465 m and 700 m under RCP 8.5.
