<p id="Par36">To visualize the functional trait spaces of current and projected future bird assemblages on two trait dimensions (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we computed the Euclidean distances between species in the functional trait space of the first five PCoA axes and used these distances in a Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS, metaMDS in “vegan” package in R). The NMDS condensed the variation of the five PCoA axes onto two axes. The scaling achieved a stable solution (stress value = 0.07) and the two NMDS dimensions can therefore be considered representative for visualizing the overall trait variation among species based on the ten morphological traits. We fitted trait-arrows to the NMDS space to indicate how five of the ten morphological bird traits, representing the different types of traits (body mass, bill length, Kipp’s distance, tail length, tarsus length), were related to the ordination axes. These arrows indicate that variation in body mass was primarily related to the first NMDS axis, while the second axes primarily represented variation in Kipp’s distance (higher at negative values) and tarsus length (higher at positive values) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, first panel).
