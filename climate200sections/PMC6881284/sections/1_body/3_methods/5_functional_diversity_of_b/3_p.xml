The quality of the functional trait spaces was calculated as the mean squared deviation (mSD) between the initial distances between species (based on raw trait values) and the distance between species in the projected functional trait space

 </sup>. The functional trait space with the lowest mSD is considered to have the highest quality, 
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., this trait space is the best representation of the initial functional trait values. We tested nine functional trait spaces (from two to ten dimensions). mSD ranged from 0.01 to 0.03, with the lowest value belonging to the functional trait space with five dimensions. The five PCoA axes explained 98.1% of total variation among species (78.6%, 9.1%, 5.3%, 2.9% and 2.2%, respectively). Consequently, FDis values were calculated from the five-dimensional trait space. The centre of the trait space corresponds to average combinations of functional traits in the trait space. This is where the species with the most widespread trait combinations are located. The margin of the trait space corresponds to more extreme trait combinations and is where functionally more specialized species are located.
