 <caption> Potential changes in functional dispersion (FDis) of bird assemblages under projected future climate change (based on the RCP 8.5 scenario). Shown are four potential dispersal scenarios representing ( a) no range change, ( b) range contraction (lower range limit moves upwards), ( c) range expansion (upper range limit moves upwards), and ( d) range shift (both lower and upper range limit move upwards), with the lower panels showing the projected absolute changes in FDis, for each of seven elevational levels, representing a gradient from 500 m to 3500 m (at 500 m intervals). Absolute changes in FDis are based on species distribution models (SDMs) of 232 birds under current and projected future climate change scenarios using representative concentration pathway RCP 8.5 and the respective dispersal scenario. The values represent mean and standard deviation of the results derived from five general circulation models (CC, HE, MC, MG, NO). FDis calculations were derived from the first five PCoA axes, computed from ten morphological bird traits and are based on the SDM-derived probability of occurrence of bird species. Positive FDis values indicate an increase of FDis under climate change, and negative values a decrease. Projected future assemblages at 500 m were completely depleted of species under range contraction and shift scenarios. </caption>
