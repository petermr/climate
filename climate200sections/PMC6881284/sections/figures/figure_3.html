 <caption> Projected changes in functional trait spaces of frugivorous bird assemblages under climate change assuming a no range change scenario. The functional trait space is derived from Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS, based on Euclidean distances) which condenses the dissimilarity of the first five PCoA axes, computed from ten morphological bird traits (bill width, bill length, bill height, tail length, tarsus length, tarsus sagittal width, tarsus lateral width, wing length, Kipp’s distance and body mass) onto two axes for visualization (NMDS 1, NMDS 2). Trait spaces are shown for the entire bird assemblage (upper left) and for assemblages on each of the seven elevational levels (500 m to 3500 m, at 500 m intervals). Black polygons illustrate the functional trait space of the entire bird assemblage. Black stippled polygons illustrate the functional trait space of the current local assemblage at the given elevation. Each dot represents one bird species ( n = 232). Within each elevational level, dot size represents the probability of occurrence as derived from SDMs. Black dots represent current assemblages, transparent green dots represent occurrence probabilities under projected climate change (based on the RCP 8.5 scenario for 2080, MIROC5 climate model). Species-level changes are visible in four ways: (1) complete black dots indicate future loss of species, (2) complete light green dots indicate future immigration of species, (3) dark green dots with a black ring indicate future decline in occurrence probability, and (4) dark green dots with a light green ring indicate future increase in occurrence probability. Bird silhouettes in the upper left panel indicate the approximate location of key taxonomic groups in trait space (counterclockwise from top): toucans, tinamous, guans, parrots, trogons and tanagers. Fitted trait arrows indicate the relationship between five morphological bird traits (representing the different types of traits) and the ordination axes. </caption>
