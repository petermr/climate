 <caption>
  <p>Biomass rate of net change in mixed subtropical forest stands subjected to different logging histories in subtropical South America. Biomass net change is shown both in forest patches with different management histories (left) and as a function of functional diversity (right). In the box plot, the central notches represent median values; upper and lower vertical bars (whiskers) are the fourth and first quartiles, respectively; notches surrounding the median represent median 95% confidence intervals; vertical bars connect the minimum and maximum values measured; o, extreme value; *, outlier. Nonoverlapping of notches indicates significant difference at 95% confidence level</p>
