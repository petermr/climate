<p>The ecological groups structure and the functional dynamics in logged forests were markedly different from unlogged ones. On the one hand, logged forests showed clear signs of recovery from past disturbances. In recently logged forests, where selective timber extraction occurred until the 1980s, aboveground biomass and basal area increased, while tree density decreased. These structural changes fit the well‐known secondary succession trajectory from low biomass and dominance by young trees, through increased mortality produced by self‐thinning, to late successional forests with lower density and larger trees (Lewis et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, Pioneers declined in abundance while the CWM of stem slenderness increased, as typically happens during successional changes where fast‐growth, resource acquiring species are replaced by slow growth, shade‐tolerant species (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Grime &amp; Pierce, ; Poorter et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The fact that management history was the most constant predictor explaining biomass change in our GLMs agrees with Pyles et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), who found that disturbance history had an overwhelming influence on Atlantic Forest tree biomass irrespective of functional diversity and trait CWM at regional scales in eastern Brazil. Importantly, the restriction of positive relationship between biomass change and functional diversity to unlogged plots likely results from complementary effects between angiosperms and araucaria. Indeed, araucaria has been shown to present a distinct niche (Souza, Bezerra, &amp; Longhi, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), set of trait values (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), and regeneration strategy (Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) compared to angiosperm species, and accumulate much of the aerial biomass of conserved mixed forests (Rosenfield &amp; Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This points to niche complementarity in the exploration of available resources between these two functional groups, what has been observed to lead to increased ecosystem performance like biomass accumulation (Loreau &amp; Hector, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).
