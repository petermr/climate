<p>Despite signs of structural maturation, floristically and functionally logged forests showed signs of arrested succession. Souza et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) had already detected that species composition of logged forests differed from unlogged ones, and Souza et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) found that the intensity of past logging events was a stronger structuring factor for species distributions in the region than abiotic factors like rock cover, elevation, and soil drainage, as has been found elsewhere (Both et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The compositional differences between stands with different logging histories corresponded to a marked reduction in the densities of araucarias, Large Seeded Pioneers, Wind Dispersed Large Trees, and Pioneers in logged forests in relation to unlogged stands, even after more than 60 years of cessation of logging operations. These groups included long‐lived pioneers that need large‐scale disturbances to recruit to adult sizes (Enright, Ogden, &amp; Rigg, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Together with the interruption of araucaria's regeneration pulse in early‐logged stands (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), this indicates that selective logging was not disruptive enough to allow adult tree replacement. The lack of long‐lived pioneers and Wind Dispersed Large Trees in logged forests explains their higher community‐weighted wood density (araucaria is a light‐wooded species) and the reduced community‐weighted height and seed size (Forgiarini et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Grime &amp; Pierce, ; Muscolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Wright et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Uncontrolled logging can cause significant forest degradation (Chazdon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Longo &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), recruitment shifts between ecological groups (Hogan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and chronic regeneration failure of exploited long‐lived pioneers (Enright et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Peña‐Claros et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Souza et al.,
