<p>Our results showed that noticeable functional changes took place in the Atlantic forests of Southern Brazil, despite only minor temporal changes at the taxonomic level. Through the evaluation of structural and trait changes between management history categories, coupled with analysis of regional climate trends, we were able to identify the most likely mechanisms underlying the observed changes. Our hypothesis that climate change affected forest structure and dynamics differentially depending on forest succession following past disturbances was confirmed. Aboveground biomass increased in all plots, but increases were higher in mature unlogged forests, which showed signs of forest growth associated with increased CO
 <sub>2</sub>, temperature, and rainfall/treefall gap disturbance at the same time. Logged forests showed arrested succession as indicated by reduced abundances of Pioneers and biomass‐accumulators like Large Seeded Pioneers and Araucaria, and, as well as reduced functional diversity. Furthermore, our regional climatic analyses illustrate the importance of understanding the regional climatic background of community‐ and landscape‐scale studies, which are frequently carried out under the unchecked and possibly unrealistic premise of stationary climatic conditions. Regional climate change may impact ecosystem processes like primary productivity (Lewis et al.,
