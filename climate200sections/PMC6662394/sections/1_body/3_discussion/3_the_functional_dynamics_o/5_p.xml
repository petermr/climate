<p>The decline in the relative abundance of araucarias also agrees with their long‐lived pioneer ecological strategy and dependence on large‐scale disturbances for successful regeneration (Paludo, Lauterjung, dos Reis, &amp; Mantovani,

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). This regeneration niche was not met by the apparently small scale of treefall gap dynamics. The effects of the predicted increase in precipitation extremes in subtropical regions during the 21st century (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) are uncertain. On the one hand, they may reduce some of the biomass accumulation potential of these forests through increased mortality of the largest trees and recruitment of younger and fast‐growing species in treefall gaps, as we and others have observed (Ge et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). On the other hand, the main biomass builder of this system, which is
