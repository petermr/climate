<p>Our results supported the expectations that mature forest dynamics are driven by the combined action of increased CO
 <sub>2</sub>/temperature and increased rainfall/treefall gap dynamics. The biomass and basal area increases we found (0.69 m
 <sup>2</sup>/ha per year) were higher than those found in subtropical deciduous forests in Argentina (0.13 m
 <sup>2</sup>/ha per year, Malizia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and in 50 plots distributed across tropical South America from a 30‐year period (0.10 m
 <sup>2</sup>/ha per year, 1971–2002; Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). The fact that basal area increase did not differ between forests with different logging histories is strong evidence of a pervasive resource level increase like rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmospheric concentration, as has been inferred based on pantropical plot networks (Holtum &amp; Winter, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). A number of factors are likely contributing to the very high aboveground biomass and basal area accumulation we observed. One of these is the rising minimum temperatures we detected. Low air temperatures constitute a limiting factor for photosynthesis and biomass increase (Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and, in the subtropics, they constitute a limiting factor for tree growth (Oliveira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Zanon &amp; Finger, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
