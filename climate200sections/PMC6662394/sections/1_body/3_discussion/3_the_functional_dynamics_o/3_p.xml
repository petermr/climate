<p>A second factor that helps explain the increased biomass accumulation in unlogged forests is the presence of very large trees. Density of large trees explains most of the variation in pan‚Äêtropical aboveground biomass, and is positively associated with rainfall and temperature (Slik et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Mature mixed Atlantic forests are dominated by large trees, mostly massive araucarias that accumulate high biomass (Chassot, Fleig, Finger, &amp; Longhi, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Rosenfield &amp; Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The presence of this species, with its' large size, abundance, but light wood (Sanquetta et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), explains the apparent paradox of unlogged forests, with all its araucarias left intact and higher biomass, nevertheless presented reduced CWM wood density compared to logged stands. Araucaria's growth is limited by atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels and low temperatures (Cattaneo, Pahr, Fassola, Leporati, &amp; Bogino, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Oliveira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Silva, Anand, Oliveira, &amp; Pillar, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Therefore, climate change in subtropical wet South America has been highly favorable for biomass accumulation by large trees, and to araucarias in particular.
