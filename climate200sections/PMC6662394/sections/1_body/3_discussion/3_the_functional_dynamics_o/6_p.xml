<p>Contrary to our prediction, the abundance of the light‐limited Small Shade Tolerant trees did not change in unlogged stands during the study period. This probably resulted from the cancelation of the positive effects of rising CO
 <sub>2</sub>, temperature, and light levels near treefall gaps (Muscolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) by light reductions due to increased cloud cover and higher mortality rates due to falling trees and debris during rainstorms (Forgiarini et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Uriarte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We attribute the restriction of these patterns to unlogged forest stands to the lack very large trees prone to windthrow in logged stands (Chazdon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) also reported that a cyclone in Australia impacted an old‐growth forest but not a logged forest.
