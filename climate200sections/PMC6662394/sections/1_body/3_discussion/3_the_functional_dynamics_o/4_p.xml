<p>There was also evidence that unlogged forests suffered increased treefall gap disturbance rates. The increased rainfall we detected and a tornado that passed through the study region in 2003 (Candido, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) agree with the general climatic trend of increasing rainfall in subtropical South America since the mid‐20th century (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and peaking tornados and rainstorms in southern Brazil (Candido, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This scenario supports our Increased Rainfall/Treefall Gap hypothesis in that increased rainfall would result in increased small scale disturbance events in the form of treefall gaps (Ge et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As expected, windthrow mortality was highest among the tallest trees, concentrated in the Wind Dispersed Large Trees and Araucaria ecological groups (Beckert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Ebling et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), which declined in abundance. The increase of Pioneers and Large‐Seeded Pioneers we observed corresponds to increased regeneration opportunities in treefall gaps (Chami et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). It agrees with the well‐documented replacement of species groups during gap‐phase dynamics from stress‐tolerant species adapted to shade (high wood density, slow growth, large seeds, shallow crown) to competitive species adapted to resource‐rich environments (lightwood, fast‐growing, large leaves with high SLA, deep crowns, small seeds)(Wright et al.,
