<p>We expected forest biomass, basal area, tree density, and tree turnover to increase in all forest patches due to the long‐term and pervasive effects of increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature. This increase, however, should be more pronounced in logged stands, in which climatic effects were combined with recovery from past disturbance. These increases should be higher also among Small Shade Tolerant species, which form the most light‐ and CO
 <sub>2</sub>‐limited ecological group (Falster, Duursma, &amp; FitzJohn,

 <sub>2</sub>‐based increase in shade tolerance, we expected decreases in unlogged plots in the community‐weighted means (CWM) of leaf size, specific leaf area, tree height, stem slenderness, and wood density, while crown depth and seed size should increase.
