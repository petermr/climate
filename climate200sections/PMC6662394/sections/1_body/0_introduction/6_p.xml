<p>Increased rainfall in southern Atlantic forests is regionally accompanied by more frequent tornados and windstorms, which peak in the subtropics due to rainier climate and colliding cold and hot air masses (Candido, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This implies both reduced solar radiation due to increased cloudiness and increased small scale secondary succession due to treefall gap dynamics (Ge, Xiong, Zhao, Shen, &amp; Xie, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Reduced solar radiation limits primary production (Graham, Mulkey, Kitajima, Phillips, &amp; Wright, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>, but see Mercado et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), while disturbance by treefall gap dynamics triggers small scale succession (Ge et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Muscolo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We expected that in unlogged plots mortality would be the highest among the tallest trees (Beckert, Rosot, &amp; Rosot, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Ebling, Guimarães, Pelissari, Abrão, &amp; de Miranda, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), triggering increases in pioneer species due to increased regeneration opportunities in treefall gaps (Chami, Araujo, Longhi, Kielse, &amp; Lúcio, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). If logged forests are recovering from past human disturbances, we expected an increased representation of slow‐growth shade‐tolerant species and of long‐lived late‐successional species (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Hogan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Malizia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These functional groups are expected to replace fast‐growing and short‐lived species that characterize disturbed forests (Rozendaal &amp; Chazdon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Additionally, we expected that the abundance of the long‐lived pioneer groups Large‐Seeded Pioneers and Araucaria should increase in recently logged stands, but not in unlogged and early logged stands. Long‐lived pioneers attain large adult sizes but depend on large canopy openings for successful regeneration, and the closed‐canopy structure of unlogged and early logged stands should thus prevent these group’ regeneration to the adult size class (Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Souza, Forgiarini, Longhi, &amp; Brena, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). We also expected that in logged forests the CWM of leaf size, specific leaf area, and crown depth would decrease, while those of wood density, stem slenderness, seed size, and tree height should increase, reflecting a successional change toward more mature forests (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Hogan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Malizia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As a consequence, we expected tree density to decline (Rozendaal &amp; Chazdon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), while basal area and biomass would increase (Pyles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), since these features are largely dependent on the presence of thick, tall trees with high wood density (Conti &amp; Díaz, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Lindenmayer &amp; Laurance, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Poorter et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Slik et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). If the above‐mentioned changes also occurred with less intensity in unlogged patches, this would suggest forest recovery from older disturbances, apart from known management history.
