<p>Disturbance is a natural process that occurs at different spatial and temporal scales (Pickett, Kolasa, Armesto, &amp; Collins, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). It plays a key role in the evolution and maintenance of plant ecological strategies (Grime &amp; Pierce, ) and is often considered a critical element in maintaining native plant communities (Davies, Svejcar, &amp; Bates, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). At a local scale, forest disturbance may seem relatively straightforward and well‐studied, since the death of one or several trees creates canopy gaps that trigger small‐scale forest succession, whose trajectory is largely dictated by functional trait distribution across species (Lohbeck et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Muscolo, Bagnato, Sidari, &amp; Mercurio, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, it has been increasingly recognized that prior disturbances exert a strong influence on the response of plant communities to subsequent disturbances (Davies et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Forest response to the interaction of different anthropogenic disturbances like logging and climate change is still poorly understood. In this study, we examine the importance of different types of disturbance for forest composition, structure, and biomass levels in subtropical mixed conifer‐hardwood Atlantic forests in South America.
