<p>Related knowledge gaps include strong biases toward old‐growth forests (Longo &amp; Keller, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and the drivers of the marked regional differences in forest change that have been registered with some regions, often wet ones, presenting biomass gains while others, often drought‐prone ones, presenting losses (Castanho et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Shen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Stephenson &amp; Mantgem, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; van der Sande et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The long‐term effects of human activities like logging also need further understanding, since most studies have taken place shortly after the impact and may conceal low decays of biodiversity or ecosystem function (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that climate change affected forest structure and dynamics differentially depending on past disturbances represented by logging history. We expected that climate change at both global and regional scales affects forest dynamics. Both experiments and theory indicate that plant photosynthesis should increase in response to globally rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations, leading to increased plant growth and forest biomass (Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations are accompanied by rising temperatures (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In the subtropics, growth is limited by winter low temperatures (Oliveira, Roig, &amp; Pillar, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Zanon &amp; Finger, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Thus, subtropical mixed forest biomass accumulation should be particularly promoted by global CO
 <sub>2 </sub>buildup and warming. A second mechanism leading to biomass accumulation in mixed forests is niche complementarity between angiosperms and conifers. Complementarity refers to niche differences between species or species groups that, due to the possession of distinct sets of traits, explore available resources in different ways and thus increase ecosystem performance, like biomass accumulation (Loreau &amp; Hector, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).
