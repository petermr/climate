<p>The community‐weighted means of all traits were significantly different between management history categories (PERMANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 30.13, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). In 2000, unlogged forest plots had taller trees, which had softer wood, more slender trunks and shallower crowns, and produced larger seeds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Leaves were smaller in recently logged plots, while SLA was larger in early‐logged plots. From 2000 to 2009, net changes in the CWM of these traits also differed significantly between management history categories (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, PERMANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 11.25, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). The dynamics of trait CWM remained stationary in both logging management histories for all traits except for stem slenderness. This trait increased in modest amounts in early‐logged and recently logged plots but suffered significantly higher increases in unlogged plots. In contrast to logged plots, unlogged trait dynamics differed from zero in all studied traits. Besides increases in stem slenderness, unlogged forests presented significant increases in CWM crown depth, leaf length, and SLA, and significant decreases in height and seed size. In 2000, the functional dispersion index of early‐logged and recently logged plots was statistically similar (pooled CI: 2.00–2.14) and lower than the functional dispersion of unlogged plots (CI: 3.17–3.45; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a). Functional dispersion changes from 2000 to 2009 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b) did not differ between stands with different logging histories (ANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 3.07, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.081) and were weakly, although significantly, negative (CI of pooled data: −0.02 to −0.06).
