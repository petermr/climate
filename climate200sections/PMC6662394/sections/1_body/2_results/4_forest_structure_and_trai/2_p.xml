<p>Total aboveground biomass increased significantly during the 9‐year interval, growing from 337.21 ± 49.82 Mg/ha in 2000 to 366.66 ± 49.98 Mg/ha in 2009. Plot‐size mean increase was 3.27 ± 3.09 Mg/ha per year (bootstrapped 95% CI = 2.88–3.67 Mg/ha per year). Our model selection procedure yielded two GLMs relating biomass change with sets of explanatory variables whose ΔAICc ≤ 2 relative to the model with lowest AICc (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35289-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The three models contained management history alone, or management history in addition to or interacting with functional diversity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Unlogged stands showed significantly greater biomass increases (bootstrapped 95% CI = 4.01–4.74 Mg/ha per year) than early‐logged and recently logged stands (bootstrapped 95% CI = 1.21–2.91 Mg/ha per year, pooled data). Functional diversity was positively related to biomass increase in unlogged plots only. Basal area also increased significantly during the census interval with a plot‐size mean increase of 0.69 ± 0.47 m
 <sup>2</sup>/ha per year (bootstrapped 95% CI = 0.63–0.75 m
 <sup>2</sup>/ha per year), but was not different between logging histories (ANOVA,
