<p>Tree species composition changed significantly from 2000 to 2009 (nested PERMANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 0.847, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) although this change was a small one (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.0014) and was slightly different depending on management history (interaction term, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 0.195, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.0007). The strongest compositional differences occurred between management histories (
 <italic>F</italic> = 50.42, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.169). Forests in each logging history category were floristically different from all others (pairwise PERMANOVA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in all cases). The NMDS (stress = 0.177) clearly depicted the compositional difference between forests with distinct management histories (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Unlogged plots were concentrated on the right side of the ordination plot, while recently logged forests were concentrated on the left side, and early‐logged forest plots lied in between. The clouds of points relative to 2000 and 2009 overlapped extensively.
