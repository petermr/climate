<p>The compositional changes detected by the PERMANOVA were reflected in functional group abundances changes, which were also significant between years and between distinct management histories, with a significant interaction between these two explanatory factors. The final GLM model was the full model with the year:functional group:management history interaction (AIC = 389.00). The removal of the hither‐term interaction was significant (GLM Analysis of Deviance, Dev = −13,267, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>) and produced a much worse model (AIC = 13,574.16). Most of the abundance differences occurred between management history categories (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Unlogged stands were dominated by Araucaria, Large Seeded Pioneers, and Large Shade Tolerants, with nearly equal abundances. Pioneers, Wind‐Dispersed Large Trees, and Small Shade Tolerants each corresponded to ca. 10% of the stems, while arborescent ferns were quite rare. However, in early‐logged and recently logged stands, functional structure was markedly diverse from the one found in unlogged areas, being dominated by Large Shade Tolerants. Arborescent ferns were more abundant in early‐logged stands than in either unlogged or recently logged ones. Temporal changes were minor and occurred mostly in unlogged stands, where the abundance of Araucaria suffered a small decline, while Pioneers and Large Seeded Pioneers increased.
