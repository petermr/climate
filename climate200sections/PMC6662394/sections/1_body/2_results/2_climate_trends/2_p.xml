<p>Between 1901 and 2014, mean annual minimum temperatures increased significantly (Linear Regression, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 100.8, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 112, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.0118 ± 0.0018°C/year, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This trend did not involve winter minimum temperatures, which did not show any tendencies through the same period (
 <italic>F</italic> = 2.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.092). It was produced by summer minimum temperatures, which increased significantly (
 <italic>F</italic> = 64.3, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) by a mean of 1.49°C from the first (19.63 ± 0.54°C) to the last (21.12 ± 0.83°C) decade of the series. The annual rainfall series had two statistically significant extreme years (Grubbs test, 
 <italic>G</italic> = 6.36, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017), which corresponded to a very dry (1962 with 821.3 mm) and a very rainy year (1972 with 2073.8 mm; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A loess regression revealed an upward trend from 1965 onwards (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Linear regressions confirmed this pattern, showing no trend from 1901 to 1964 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 1.84, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.181) but an upward trend from 1965 to 2014 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 7.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). On average, annual rainfall after 1965 (1,541 ± 214.14 mm) was 10.71% (149 mm) larger than in the years before 1965 (1,392 ± 154.78 mm; ANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 18.47, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). None of the regressions were affected by temporal autocorrelation, as shown by residuals analyses (Durbin–Watson tests, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
