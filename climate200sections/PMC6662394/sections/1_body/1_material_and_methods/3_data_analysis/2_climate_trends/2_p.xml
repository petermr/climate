<p>We evaluated temperature and rainfall records for the study area in search of long‐term local climate changes. We used a 1901–2014 data set from the Climate Research Unit TS 3.23 database (CRU, Harris, Jones, Osborn, &amp; Lister, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), which contains gridded global climate data from monthly observations interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells. All statistical analyses were carried out in the R 3.4.3 statistical software (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). LOESS regressions (Jacoby, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) were fitted to all time series to check for the presence of nonlinear patterns. Autocorrelation of the residuals from fitted linear regressions of climatic variables on time was tested by with the Durbin–Watson test using the Durbin–Watson test function in the “car” 2.1.3 package and by autocorrelation function plots using the acf function in the “stats” base package. To assess the accuracy of this global data set for the studied forests, we compared it to annual rainfall data from the Passo Tainhas meteorological station in São Francisco de Paula (data available from 1945 to 2006). Since the correlation of annual rainfall between the meteorological station and the CRU data set was high (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.718, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), the CRU data were used to assess temporal trends in annual rainfall, and highest and lowest minimum annual temperatures (referred to as summer and winter minimum temperatures, respectively). We decided to evaluate minimum temperature trends since low air temperature may be a limiting factor for photosynthesis (Lewis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), and because the annual frequency of cold nights has diminished in Southern Brazil during the last century (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Outliers were searched for using the grubbs.test function in the “outliers” 0.14 package with option type = 11, which tests if the lowest and highest values are two outliers on opposite tails of the sample. Two outliers were detected for the rainfall series. However, we decided to keep them in the analyses because removing them did not alter the results in any meaningful way.
