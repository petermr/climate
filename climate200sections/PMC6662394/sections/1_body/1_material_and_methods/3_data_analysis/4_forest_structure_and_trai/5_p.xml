<p>We used generalized linear models to evaluate how aboveground biomass was influenced by management history, functional diversity (FD index), and the CWM of traits as explanatory variables. We ran subsets of the full GLM model using different combinations of the explanatory variables and ranked them based on the AICc. In order to keep the number of models manageable and still include all types of biomass drivers, we grouped the explanatory variables into four predictor sets: forest structure (basal area and tree density), functional diversity (the functional dispersion index), management history, and the trait CWMs. We then built models using single predictor sets, all additive combinations of predictors, and models in which management history interacted with all possible combinations of the other predictor sets. The full model including interactions of management history with other sets of predictors was:</p>
