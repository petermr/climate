<p>The annual rates of net change in biomass, basal area, tree density, and CWM of traits were calculated as (

 <italic>t</italic> is the census interval (9 years). To test whether the CWM of traits were different between management history categories, we used PERMANOVA with Euclidean distances and 5,000 permutations, since the data did not meet the MANOVA multivariate assumptions. To test whether the mean rate of net change of a variable was significantly different from zero across the 250 sampled plots, we randomly selected the 250 plots, 5,000 times with replacement, and calculated the mean rate of net change of the variable for each bootstrap. If the 95% confidence intervals (CI) from the distribution derived from the bootstrapped data did not overlap zero, we considered that the net change in that variable was significant at the
