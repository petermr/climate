<p>For analyses of forest stands, trees were grouped into 20 × 20 m subplots, and analyses were restricted to the overall 2000–2009 interval. We used a nested PERMANOVA (Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) to test for the effects of time (a factor with two levels) and management history (a factor with three levels) on species abundances at the plot level. The analysis was performed using the function adonis in the “vegan” 2.4‐6 package (Dixon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), with the Bray–Curtis distance and 5,000 permutations. One‐ha plots were used as blocks within which 20 × 20 m plots were nested. Removing singleton species did not alter the analyses output in any meaningful way, so we opted to show the results with all species. We illustrated compositional differences between years and management history categories through nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). We set the number of dimensions to 4 to keep the stress below 0.20 (McCune, Grace, &amp; Urban, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The NMDS was run with the “metaMDS” function of the “vegan” package (center = T, trymax = 100). Dimensionality was assessed by examining the change in stress (the rank correlation between the calculated similarity distances and the plotted distances) as a function of dimension while stepping down from a six‐ to one‐dimensional solution.
