<p>We tested the independence of the number of trees from functional group, year, and management history through a generalized linear model (GLM) with Poisson error. A full model was fitted first, followed by manual variable removal based on Akaike's information criterion and test of significance of the interaction term with ANOVA (Zuur et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Species that were not ascribed to any of the previously mentioned ecological groups were attributed to one of them using the wood density and total height distributions percentiles provided by Souza et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Species with maximum height ≤15 m were assigned to the Small Shade Tolerant group. Species with maximum height between 15 and 19 m and wood density &lt;0.65 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> were assigned to the Pioneer group. Species with maximum height ≥19 m and wood density &lt;0.65 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup> were assigned to the Large Seeded Pioneer group. None of the previously unclassified species were assigned to the other groups. To assess plot‐level net changes over time in forest biomass, forest architecture, and trait values, we used ANOVA and bootstrapping methods (as in Feeley et al.,
