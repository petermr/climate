  <title>Map showing the potential for invasive plant expansion in RCP 4.5 for terrestrial ecoregions (A) and freshwater ecoregions (B).</title>
  <p>The colours coupled with the numbers in this figure represent the level of IPS expansion potential across different ecoregions. Blue means there is a very high chance of expansion and tan-yellow means a low chance of expansion. The ecoregion maps were obtained from the studies of 
   <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al. (2001)</xref> and 
   <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Abell et al. (2008)</xref>.
