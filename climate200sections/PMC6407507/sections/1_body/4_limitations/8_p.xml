 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Briscoe et al., 2016</xref>) have shown that ensemble modellings have better performance for prediction of current and future distributions than a single algorithm (
 <xref rid="ref-85" ref-type="bibr">Thuiller et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the modelling transferability may be low. However, some modellings (i.e. general linear modelling) need real absence points. Hence, it is still a challenge to assess IPS expansion potential at large scales due to the lack of real absence points. Here, we suggested to determine the real absence points based on the ranges of presence points and ecoregions across different time periods using the method of
