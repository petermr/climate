<p>Our study provided a global method to evaluate the present and future expansion of IPS and is a resource for the prevention and control of IPS. We found that global climate change would cause IPS, such as aquatic plants, trees, and herbs to attack global ecoregions by expanding in coastal ecoregions or high latitudes. Plant invasion has a large potential to be enhanced due to the process of economic globalisation and rapid climate change. Therefore, the risk evaluation of universal coverage for IPS is urgently needed at a global scale.</p>
