<p>We evaluated the predictive precision of Maxent using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operation characteristic, which regards each value of the prediction result as a possible threshold, before obtaining the corresponding sensitivity and specificity through calculations (

 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we used the average omission rates of training occurrence records to further assess the predictive precision of Maxent for each IPS according to six thresholds of distribution presence. These thresholds included fixed cumulative value five, fixed cumulative value 10, equal training sensitivity and specificity, maximum training sensitivity plus specificity, maximum test sensitivity plus specificity, and equate entropy of threshold and original distributions (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>). When AUC values were above 0.7, and meanwhile the average omission rates of training occurrence records were less than 0.017, the modellings were included in our study (
