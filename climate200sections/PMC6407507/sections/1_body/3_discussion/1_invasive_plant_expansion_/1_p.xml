<p>This study evaluated and mapped the potential expansion of IPS in global ecoregions due to climate change. Climate change could increase the potential expansion of IPS, including aquatic plants, trees, and herbs to spread in the ecoregions distributing in Northern Europe, the UK, South America, North America, southwest China, and New Zealand. We found that climate change would drive IPS into coastal biomes or high latitude areas and suppress the growth of alpine, temperate, and coastal plants. 
 <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr">Steinbauer et al. (2018)</xref> have shown that the likelihood for plant species richness to increase on mountain summits is linked to climate warming, indicating that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences for both biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Previous studies coupled with our results have shown that climate change would increase the risk of IPS in coastal regions or high latitude areas (
