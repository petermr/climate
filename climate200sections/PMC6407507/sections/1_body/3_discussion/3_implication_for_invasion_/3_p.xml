<p>Finally, we need to determine the exchange pathways of IPS in ecoregions around the world and establish a monitoring network of geographic information for IPS expansion in ecoregions. Previous research has presented a comprehensive analysis of global accumulation and exchange pathways of IPS across continents and provided important references for the prevention of IPS expansion by human-mediated dispersal of species into new regions (

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). Combined with our assessment of the expansion potential of IPS across global ecoregions, we should integrate exchange pathways of IPS across native and invaded ranges into a global monitoring network for invasion risk under climate change. For example, 
 <italic>A. mearnsii</italic>, native to Australia, could invade South Africa and cause ecological, economic, and social damage in invaded ranges (
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Le Maitre et al., 2002</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al. (2014)</xref> proposed an approach to manage the invasion risk of 
 <italic>A. mearnsii</italic> in South Africa by identifying the exchange pathways between Australia and South Africa. Hence, such determination of exchange pathways could be based on ecoregion scales due to climate change.
