<p>In addition, we also found that there was a significant linear relationship between temperature changes and the potential of IPS to expand in biomes, indicating that the potential of IPS to invade ecoregions could be predicted by reasonable monitoring (

 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Diez et al., 2012</xref>). Although our data suggests that IPS could not severely invade the ecoregions listed above, we need to prevent the escalated risk of IPS by extreme climatic events in these ecoregions (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Diez et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, these linear relationships provided insight into ecological restoration (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Bradley, Oppenheimer &amp; Wilcove, 2009</xref>). When we take action to restore ecoregions, such as Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, Large Lakes, and Tropical and Subtropical Floodplain Rivers and Wetland Complexes, we should consider the role of climate factors on the potential for IPS invasion during ecological restoration.
