<p>Our findings suggest that the variable most important to climatic suitability for IPS was annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality indicated that temperature could affect the IPS expansion potential in the ecoregions. The ecoregions with large changes of annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality would be severely invaded by IPS in Montane Grasslands and Shrublands, Temperate Forests, Tundra, and some Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests. For freshwater ecoregions, IPS also had the potential to expand in the regions with large changes in temperature seasonality. These freshwater regions included Coastal and Polar regions. However, Tundra and Polar regions are extremely unsuitable for IPS in current climate conditions (
