 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 1999</xref>). Following the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, local governments in Japan have engaged enthusiastically with climate change mitigation via climate change plans geared towards emissions reduction and renewable energy deployment (
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Kameyama, 2016</xref>). However, progress on adaptation has been much slower. The 2018 Climate Change Adaptation Act now mandates municipal governments to form Local Climate Change Action Plans. Yet up until this point, few Japanese cities have had specific laws and plans to address adaptation action, and there is limited evidence of practical adaptation actions at the local level (

Fukuoka City Government also released in 2016 a climate change countermeasures action plan to integrate climate and environmental plans and link mitigation with adaptation, continuing actions which have developed since the city made its first local climate plan in 1994 (
