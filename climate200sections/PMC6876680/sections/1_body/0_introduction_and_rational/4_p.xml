<p id="p0040">For the purpose of this City Profile, we focus on Fukuoka City as an administrative unit. This is because (a) Fukuoka City Government is the municipal administrative unit governing the built-up area of Fukuoka City, and hence can make finer-scale recommendations than the higher-level prefectural government; and (b) Fukuoka Prefecture in any case is required to develop adaptation actions for a mixed rural and urban context. Indeed, it is noted in Fukuoka City's climate plan that the prefectural climate plan provides general overarching guidance for the city's actions, but that these are translated into practice via policies and spatial plans produced by the city government (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2016a</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, we therefore use 
 <italic>Fukuoka City</italic> to describe specific actions undertaken by Fukuoka City Government, and 
 <italic>Fukuoka</italic> to refer to more general social and cultural characteristics in the wider Fukuoka area. Actions and policies relevant to Fukuoka City but enacted by Fukuoka Prefecture are of course considered within the profile as and when appropriate.
