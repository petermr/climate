<p id="p0045">The information presented in this paper is derived from three sources. First is policy documentation produced by Fukuoka City and also Fukuoka Prefecture relating to climate change adaptation and the urban environment, including climate change plans, greenspace plans, and urban planning masterplans. Second is a review of scholarly research outputs pertaining to urban planning and environmental change with an empirical focus on Fukuoka. These were collated via ‘snowball’ sampling based on (a) searching Web of Science for the terms ‘Fukuoka’ and ‘climate’, ‘greenspace’ or ‘planning’; and (b) searching the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science's KAKEN database for additional Japanese-language projects and outputs, using Japanese equivalents of the same search terms. Third are eight in-depth interviews with people associated with local adaptation responses: one at Fukuoka City Environment Division; one at the Fukuoka City Green City Promotion Department; one at Fukuoka Prefecture Environment Division; one at the Fukuoka Center for Climate Change Actions; one at Kyushu Environmental Evaluation Association; one with an academic involved in the expert committee for Fukuoka City's Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan; one with an academic involved in local and regional adaptation planning in Japan; and one at a private-sector consultancy providing public bodies with advice on climate change responses and environmental management actions. Whilst the profile is based largely on the review of policy and scholarly outputs, the interviews provided additional contextual information. This allowed observations from the policy analysis and review of academic research to be clarified, and also allowed respondents to provide a more critical and evaluative insight on the extent to which policy rhetoric translates into practice (see
