<p id="p0240">This City Profile has illustrated that within Japan, Fukuoka has made relatively early progress on local governance of climate change adaptation, particular as regards consideration of specific implementation actions when compared to cities in western Japan of similar size and climate. What is perhaps most distinctive is that there is in Fukuoka a robust body of scientific evidence produced by local scholars and institutions on which municipal policymakers may draw to support their decisions. Our profile also supports the argument that whilst climate change adaptation may be a relatively new area for local governments in Japan, there are already comprehensive policy frameworks in place in areas such as environmental protection, disaster prevention, and appropriately-informed greenspace planning which can act as a foundation to facilitate actions necessary for climate adaptation (

In Fukuoka, greenspace planning policies appear particularly well-suited to adapting to the effects of increased heat and rainfall, in that explicit consideration of climate adaptation may be considered only the latest iteration in the city of a much longer policy and research interest into how the urban green environment can be configured to create a ‘liveable environment’ for citizens.
