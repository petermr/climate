<p id="p0245">Nonetheless, there are limitations to the applicability of Fukuoka's experience with climate adaptation to other international cities. Whilst Fukuoka is indeed an expanding, subtropical, medium-sized city in Asia, the current and historical context makes it a distinctive and in some ways anomalous case. The strong technical and scientific competences in understanding the local environment held by local institutions and researchers in Fukuoka, and the associated drive to connect this with policy-making and undertake research in the public interest, may to an extent be the result of Kyushu's specific historical experiences with pollution. Fukuoka is also a large, well-resourced and still-growing city in a wealthy country context. This may afford the city access to funds to support the development of comprehensive climate and environmental policies, and also aid the recruitment and training of technically capable local government staff. Whether such actions would be possible to the same extent in other rapidly developing subtropical Asian cities without this level of resourcing and the specific social and environmental history is open to question.</p>
