<p id="p0065">Fukuoka developed as twin cities from the 17th Century onwards. Fukuoka, to the west of the Naka River, was a castle town of the samurai military class. Hakata, to the east of the river, was a city of merchants. The legacy of this historical structure is still visible today in the divide between the commercial centre of the city east of the Naka River, and the administrative and entertainment areas to its west.</p>
