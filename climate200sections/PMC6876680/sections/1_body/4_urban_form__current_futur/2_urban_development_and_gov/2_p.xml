 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The current layout of the city's central area still largely reflects the form laid down during systematic post-World War II reconstruction planning. Meanwhile, mountains to the south and the sea to the north mean development entails either expansion in an east-west direction, or intensification.
