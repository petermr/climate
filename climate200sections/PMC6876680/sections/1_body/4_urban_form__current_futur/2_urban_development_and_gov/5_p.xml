<p id="p0105">Administratively, Fukuoka City is divided into seven wards (see 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The ward names loosely correspond to names of areas from the time of the Kuroda samurai clan in the 17th Century. However, the wards in their contemporary form are a superimposed political structure. The wards were created when Fukuoka was made a designated city by the Japanese government in 1972. Initially the city consisted of five wards, however the former Nishi Ward was subdivided into Jonan Ward, Nishi Ward and Sawara Ward in 1982. The main business and commerce district is Hakata Ward, whilst most entertainment and retail is located in the Tenjin area of Chuo Ward. Together, the Hakata and Tenjin areas make up the core of Fukuoka City.
