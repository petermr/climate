<p id="p0125">Given the focus of this profile on climate adaptation, it is worth noting recent experience with natural disasters, weather and climate in the city. Whilst not as seismically active as other areas in Japan, Fukuoka was struck by a powerful earthquake registering 
 <italic>shindo</italic> 6 (the most powerful being 
 <italic>shindo</italic> 7) on March 20,2005, causing damage to buildings, killing one person and forcing evacuation of much of Genkai Island at the edge of Hakata Bay. In 2009, heavy rainfall in northern Kyushu in late July caused increases in river water levels. This resulted in flooding in many parts of Fukuoka, forcing citizens to temporarily evacuate and causing five deaths in the Fukuoka metropolitan area (

Based on observational research into Fukuoka's thermal environment, the Hakata-Tenjin area was identified as a ‘hot spot,’ and has subsequently been the focus of further research and experimental measures to mitigate heat island effects (

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that community and private sector greening activities, whilst not undertaken explicitly for heat mitigation, are also focused on the Hakata and Chuo Wards (where Hakata-Tenjin is located) where green coverage is lower. Flood risk and evacuation maps have been produced for each ward, identifying areas at risk in the event of inundation and illustrating evacuation routes and shelters (
