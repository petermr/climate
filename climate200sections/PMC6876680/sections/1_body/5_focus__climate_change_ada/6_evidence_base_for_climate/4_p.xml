<p id="p0175">Academic knowledge and research findings connect with local government policy through the participation of researchers from local institutions (e.g. Kyushu University/Kyushu Institute of Design, Fukuoka University, Kyushu Environmental Evaluation Association/Fukuoka Center for Climate Change Actions) on expert committees for the adaptation-related plans listed in 
 <xref rid="s0045" ref-type="sec">Section 6.1</xref>. This provides a contrast to 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al. (2017)</xref>, who identify a lack of expert knowledge and experience at the municipal level as a barrier to local climate adaptation in Japan. The role of Naohito Asano of Fukuoka University at the academia-policy interface is particularly noteworthy. Asano was an expert panel member for Fukuoka City's 
 <italic>Cool and Adapt Project</italic>, and also chaired the expert committee for Fukuoka Prefecture's Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan. What is significant is that Asano is an environmental lawyer whose career has been conducted largely in Fukuoka, with a professional interest in the use of local urban planning legislation and policy as a way to secure quality of living for citizens (e.g. 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Asano, 1988</xref>). As such, the connection of the research base with planning policy actions has been aided by a community of academics with an understanding of the technical and scientific principles of urban climate adaptation gained at many cases at local institutions, 
 <italic>and</italic> also knowledge of the legislation and policy that can put these actions into practice.
