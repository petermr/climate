 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> compares Fukuoka's actions on climate change within greenspace- and urban planning to two other western Japanese coastal cities of similar size and climatic characteristics â€“ Hiroshima and Kobe. The intention is simply to provide some comparative context, and not to compare or criticise the cities in question. However, it is striking that Fukuoka's greenspace plan in particular contains a relatively high level of detail and specificity, especially for urban heat island mitigation.
