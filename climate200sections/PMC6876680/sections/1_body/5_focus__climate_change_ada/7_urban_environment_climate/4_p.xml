<p id="p0205">Locally, signage on the terraces explains ACROS' biodiversity (authors' own visit, 2018), and the image of ACROS is frequently used in public-facing material relating to urban climate in Fukuoka (e.g. the New Green Basic Plan Summary Leaflet, (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009d</xref>)). The site hence has a symbolic role within Fukuoka in motivating action towards climate change countermeasures and urban climate protection. Since ACROS was built, other large-scale green roofs have developed in Fukuoka. The 
 <italic>Grin Grin</italic> active learning space and botanical garden in Island City Central Park has a green roof area of 1000â€¯m
 <sup>2</sup> over three connected buildings and opened in 2005 (

 <italic>Tenjin Core</italic> shopping centre also installed a green roof, but is scheduled to close as part of the Tenjin Big Bang intensification works. Fukuoka City Government is responsible for the 
 <italic>Green Curtain Project</italic> and 
 <italic>Flower City Fukuoka</italic> initiatives, which collaborate with citizens and the private sector to encourage development of green walls and localised greenery respectively.
