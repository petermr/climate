<p id="p0200">The ACROS Fukuoka Prefectural International Hall is an example of a location where greening has delivered local cooling and also biodiversity benefits (see

 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Completed in 1995 and designed by green architecture pioneer Emilio Ambasz, ACROS features woodland on the stepped fa√ßade of a 15-storey building (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Jim, 2017a</xref>) and is directly connected to the adjacent Tenjin Central Park. The building provides public good by containing a concert hall and government service points, as well as restaurants and office space. It is reported to host 40,000 plants and trees spanning 120 species. The ACROS terraces were not designed to provide climate or biodiversity benefits. Rather, the focus was on aesthetics, and on reducing the general environmental impact of the development (
