We focus on the city's local climate change adaptation policies, and in particular the role of urban and greenspace planning in facilitating adaptation actions within Fukuoka. Fukuoka is a humid subtropical city which is currently experiencing significant population and economic growth. It has also made comparatively rigorous advances in climate adaptation, in a country context where local governments have been criticised for focusing more on mitigation. Fukuoka hence may yield lessons for other rapidly urbanising subtropical Asian cities. We illustrate that Fukuoka has a long tradition of science-policy connection towards the creation of a liveable urban environment. This creates a favourable research and policy infrastructure for adaptation, in particular mitigation of heat risk. This is evidenced in consideration of climate issues within the city's greenspace plans since the 1990s, and in an extensive body of underpinning applied research from local institutions into urban thermal environments in particular. Fukuoka's green terraced ACROS building has come to symbolise adaptation via the built environment, and has been followed by the emergence of further green roofs and through citizen and private sector involvement in smaller-scale greening actions. We caution that challenges remain around connecting different sections of local governments, and in maintaining climate and environmental imperatives in the face of ongoing development and expansion pressures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">Fukuoka among early adopters of municipal climate change adaptation action in Japan</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Fukuoka demonstrates adaptation responses for an expanding sub-tropical Asian city.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Understanding of wind corridors and cooling by greening informs Fukuoka city plans.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Adaptation via planning continues much longer trend of liveable urban environment.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Challenges remain in balancing economic development pressures with climate actions.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change adaptation</kwd><kwd>Fukuoka</kwd><kwd>Urban climate change governance</kwd><kwd>Urban greenspace</kwd><kwd>Urban planning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction and rationale</title><p id="p0030">Although Japanese policy on climate change has been criticised for focusing more on mitigation than adaptation at the local<xref rid="fn0005" ref-type="fn">1</xref> level (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Kameyama, 2016</xref>), Fukuoka City has considered adaptation to the effects of environmental change within its greenspace and urban plans since the late 1990s (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 1999</xref>). Following the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, local governments in Japan have engaged enthusiastically with climate change mitigation via climate change plans geared towards emissions reduction and renewable energy deployment (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Kameyama, 2016</xref>). However, progress on adaptation has been much slower. The 2018 Climate Change Adaptation Act now mandates municipal governments to form Local Climate Change Action Plans. Yet up until this point, few Japanese cities have had specific laws and plans to address adaptation action, and there is limited evidence of practical adaptation actions at the local level (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Hijioka et al., 2016</xref>). In Fukuoka, by contrast, locally-based researchers have undertaken applied research on the relationship between urban greening, the built environment and urban thermal environments for several decades (e.g. <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Katayama et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Nitta, Azuma, &#x00026; Ishii, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Yoda &#x00026; Katayama, 1998</xref>). Fukuoka City Government also released in 2016 a climate change countermeasures action plan to integrate climate and environmental plans and link mitigation with adaptation, continuing actions which have developed since the city made its first local climate plan in 1994 (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2016a</xref>). This initial formalised climate action came several years ahead of comparable western Japanese cities such as Kyoto (1997); Kobe (2000); Osaka (2002); and Hiroshima (2003).</p><p id="p0035">Fukuoka is therefore significant for several reasons. Firstly, it can be considered a front-running city within Japan for local climate change policy, and also for actions targeted specifically towards adaptation to environmental change supported by the applied research history outlined above. Second, despite national trends, the population in Fukuoka is growing at the fastest rate of any Japanese city (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka Asian Urban Research Center, 2018</xref>), with resulting urban development and expansion (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2018a</xref>). Third, Fukuoka is among the southernmost designated cities in Japan in the humid subtropical climate zone. Assessing how Fukuoka has integrated climate adaptation-related issues into its local policies despite slow national progress, and clarifying remaining challenges, may hence yield lessons for other expanding Asian subtropical cities facing increasing climate-related risks such as urban heat island effects and flooding. In the wider international context, evaluation of how Fukuoka has managed urban heat in particular can contribute to a knowledge gap identified by the IPCC's Cities and Climate theme around knowledge of the relation between planning and the thermal environment in non-European or North American contexts (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Prieur-Richard et al., 2018</xref>). Elaboration of how Fukuoka has drawn on techno-scientific expertise and evidence to support adaptation via urban planning can feed into debates &#x02013; as per a recent <italic>Nature Sustainability</italic> expert panel - on how &#x02018;the science of cities&#x02019; can inform urban climate responses (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Acuto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">For the purpose of this City Profile, we focus on Fukuoka City as an administrative unit. This is because (a) Fukuoka City Government is the municipal administrative unit governing the built-up area of Fukuoka City, and hence can make finer-scale recommendations than the higher-level prefectural government; and (b) Fukuoka Prefecture in any case is required to develop adaptation actions for a mixed rural and urban context. Indeed, it is noted in Fukuoka City's climate plan that the prefectural climate plan provides general overarching guidance for the city's actions, but that these are translated into practice via policies and spatial plans produced by the city government (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2016a</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, we therefore use <italic>Fukuoka City</italic> to describe specific actions undertaken by Fukuoka City Government, and <italic>Fukuoka</italic> to refer to more general social and cultural characteristics in the wider Fukuoka area. Actions and policies relevant to Fukuoka City but enacted by Fukuoka Prefecture are of course considered within the profile as and when appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Data sources</title><p id="p0045">The information presented in this paper is derived from three sources. First is policy documentation produced by Fukuoka City and also Fukuoka Prefecture relating to climate change adaptation and the urban environment, including climate change plans, greenspace plans, and urban planning masterplans. Second is a review of scholarly research outputs pertaining to urban planning and environmental change with an empirical focus on Fukuoka. These were collated via &#x02018;snowball&#x02019; sampling based on (a) searching Web of Science for the terms &#x02018;Fukuoka&#x02019; and &#x02018;climate&#x02019;, &#x02018;greenspace&#x02019; or &#x02018;planning&#x02019;; and (b) searching the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science's KAKEN database for additional Japanese-language projects and outputs, using Japanese equivalents of the same search terms. Third are eight in-depth interviews with people associated with local adaptation responses: one at Fukuoka City Environment Division; one at the Fukuoka City Green City Promotion Department; one at Fukuoka Prefecture Environment Division; one at the Fukuoka Center for Climate Change Actions; one at Kyushu Environmental Evaluation Association; one with an academic involved in the expert committee for Fukuoka City's Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan; one with an academic involved in local and regional adaptation planning in Japan; and one at a private-sector consultancy providing public bodies with advice on climate change responses and environmental management actions. Whilst the profile is based largely on the review of policy and scholarly outputs, the interviews provided additional contextual information. This allowed observations from the policy analysis and review of academic research to be clarified, and also allowed respondents to provide a more critical and evaluative insight on the extent to which policy rhetoric translates into practice (see <xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec">Section 6.5</xref> in particular).</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Location and social and environmental characteristics</title><p id="p0050">Fukuoka is located in the north of Kyushu, the southern-most of Japan's four main islands (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It is bordered by Hakata Bay (which opens into the Genkai Sea) to the north, and by the Sangun Mountain Range to the east and the Sefuri Mountain Range to the south-west. Fukuoka City is located within Fukuoka Prefecture, on the Fukuoka Plain. Fukuoka Prefecture is one of the 47 regional administrative units in Japan, and includes the urbanised area of Kitakyushu and the more rural areas of Chikuho and Chikugo over an area of 4584 km<sup>2</sup>. The population of Fukuoka Prefecture was approximately 5.1 million people in 2018, of whom around 3.8 million people were living in the urbanised areas of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka Prefecture, 2019</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Location of Fukuoka City within Japan, showing major cities and locations mentioned in the city profile.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/><attrib>(Source: adapted from <xref rid="bb6000" ref-type="bibr">Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2019</xref>)</attrib></fig></p><p id="p0055">The population of Fukuoka City was approximately 1.5 million people in 2018, over an area of 340&#x0202f;km<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2017</xref>).

Fukuoka, to the west of the Naka River, was a castle town of the samurai military class. Hakata, to the east of the river, was a city of merchants. The legacy of this historical structure is still visible today in the divide between the commercial centre of the city east of the Naka River, and the administrative and entertainment areas to its west.</p><p id="p0070">Settlement in the area where Fukuoka is now located began approximately 26,000&#x0202f;years ago, when people crossed from the Asian continent. Around 15,000&#x0202f;years ago, the region became separated from the rest of Asia by what is now the Genkai Sea. Rice farming superseded a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and the people of the region started to run agricultural communities. The first state in the Japanese archipelago was established in the region, with records showing that in 57&#x0202f;CE, the Emperor of the Late Han Dynasty gave a gold seal to envoys sent by the king to request support for their kingdom (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Museum, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0075">After the centre of the nation moved east, the region where Fukuoka is located today played an important role for diplomacy, commerce and defence. The government of the time established a diplomatic facility called the Korokan, which in turn was succeeded as a centre of commerce by an area known as <italic>Hakata</italic>, which supported Chinese traders. Following attempted Mongolian invasions in the late 13th Century, trade with Ming (China), the Ryukyu Islands and the Korean Peninsula made Hakata a flourishing trading port (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Museum, 2013</xref>). The Hakata name is still visible today as one of the seven wards in Fukuoka City, and as the name for the main high-speed rail station in the city.</p><p id="p0080">In 1601, the House of Kuroda established a new castle and town near to Hakata. This new town was named <italic>Fukuoka</italic> after the feudal lord Nagamasa Kuroda's birthplace in Okayama Prefecture. In April 1889, the government issued an order for municipalisation, and the towns of Fukuoka and Hakata were merged. &#x02018;Fukuoka&#x02019; was chosen as the name for the new city. At this time, their populations were 20,410 and 25,677 respectively (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009a</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">Fukuoka City continued to expand and developed a streetcar network in the early part of the 20th Century, but the city was heavily damaged by bombing raids in World War II. The city rebuilt and continued to develop along with Japan's post-War economic miracle, becoming Kyushu's core city by the mid-1970s. At this time, the Tenjin Underground Shopping Mall, Tenjin Station on the Fukuoka Municipal Subway Line, and several large department stores opened in the Tenjin area. The opening of the Tenjin Subway Line shifted in the flow of people in the central part of Fukuoka, changing the flow from along Meiji-Dori on an east-west axis, to Watanabe-Dori on a north-south axis (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009b</xref>). In 1987, in response to citizen preferences for comfort and aesthetics over function and efficiency, Fukuoka City Government enacted legislation focusing on the urban landscape and initiated the Fukuoka City Urban Landscape Award to recognize those who contributed to the creation of an appealing urban landscape (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>5</label><title>Urban form, current/future developments, and climate adaptation and greenspace governance</title><sec id="s0030"><label>5.1</label><title>Urban development and governance context</title><p id="p0090">Whilst the different characters of east- and west Fukuoka are rooted in several centuries of history, the precise urban form of the city and its current development trajectory are informed by topographical constraints and more recent events (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The current layout of the city's central area still largely reflects the form laid down during systematic post-World War II reconstruction planning. Meanwhile, mountains to the south and the sea to the north mean development entails either expansion in an east-west direction, or intensification.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Fukuoka City.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/><attrib>(Source: source: adapted from <xref rid="bb6000" ref-type="bibr">Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2019</xref>)</attrib></fig><fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Hakata-Tenjin core area.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0015">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/><attrib>(Source: adapted from <xref rid="bb6000" ref-type="bibr">Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2019</xref>)</attrib></fig></p><p id="p0095">After Fukuoka was heavily damaged by saturation bombing during World War II, the current form of the city's central area was largely set by implementation of post-War reconstruction plans in the 1950s and 1960s (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 1979</xref>). Hakata Station was moved 600&#x0202f;m to the north at this time, and became the meeting point for the Sumiyoshi and Taihaku roads. With development to the south constrained by mountain ranges, land reclamation has taken place into Hakata Bay to the north. Reclamation commenced in the 1930s, but intensified from the 1970s onwards to the north-east in particular (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Ishibashi &#x00026; Shibata, 2014</xref>). Island City Fukuoka, completed in 2005, is one such development with mixed residential, recreational and institutional land uses.</p><p id="p0100">As outlined in <xref rid="s0015" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, Fukuoka has experienced notable population growth and in-migration. Yet in addition to geographical constraints, noise protection controls around Fukuoka Airport to the east, and strict municipal urbanisation control regulations to manage sprawl, further limit expansion and development. Current real estate development and expansion is thus focused in the direction of Itoshima City to the west (aided by the relocation of some parts of Kyushu University from the Ropponmatsu area of Jonan Ward to a new campus in the far west of Fukuoka City), and Kasyua County to the north-east. Development has also taken place into the 21st Century along the Japan Railways line to Kasuga City and Onojo City to the south-east, however this area is now reaching saturation. Given these geographical and land use constraints, the current Fukuoka City Urban Planning Masterplan states that consolidation and development of the Hakata-Tenjin core area is key to attaining the goal of making Fukuoka City an interchange and focal point for Asia, and also to extracting more economic value from Fukuoka's core area in line with the city's growth (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2014</xref>). To aid this process, Fukuoka City Government has initiated the &#x02018;Tenjin Big Bang&#x02019; project, which has relaxed regulations on the height of buildings and on floor area ratio to encourage redevelopment of 30 old buildings in Tenjin by 2024 (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2018a</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">Administratively, Fukuoka City is divided into seven wards (see <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The ward names loosely correspond to names of areas from the time of the Kuroda samurai clan in the 17th Century. However, the wards in their contemporary form are a superimposed political structure. The wards were created when Fukuoka was made a designated city by the Japanese government in 1972. Initially the city consisted of five wards, however the former Nishi Ward was subdivided into Jonan Ward, Nishi Ward and Sawara Ward in 1982. The main business and commerce district is Hakata Ward, whilst most entertainment and retail is located in the Tenjin area of Chuo Ward. Together, the Hakata and Tenjin areas make up the core of Fukuoka City.<fig id="f0020"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Wards of Fukuoka City.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0020">Fig. 4</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/><attrib>(Source: produced by authors)</attrib></fig></p><p id="p0110">Most of the Fukuoka metropolitan area falls under the jurisdiction of Fukuoka City Government. This is the municipal government for Fukuoka City, and is located within Fukuoka Prefecture &#x02013; the regional level of government. As far as climate change governance is concerned, it is Fukuoka City (i.e. the municipal level) which is mandated to produce a climate adaptation plan for the city. The municipal government is responsible for translating climate-related legislation, policies and directives from the national and prefectural governments into practice.

The Kyushu Environmental Evaluation Association, which has been involved in monitoring urban thermal environments and in hosting the Fukuoka Center for Climate Change Actions, was specifically set up by academics in the early 1970s to monitor water quality as a result of events in Minamata. Asano too was engaged with the legal aspects of Minamata Disease earlier in his career (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Asano, 1992</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">There is also a concurrent interest in Fukuoka in the provision of <italic>kaiteki kankyou</italic> &#x02013; a liveable environment &#x02013; through urban planning and environmental governance.

Indeed, as per <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Hiroshima City Government explicitly states that climate adaptation is considered within wider disaster risk reduction measures. What is perhaps distinctive about Fukuoka is therefore the <italic>explicit</italic> focus on climate change within greenspace- and urban planning measures. Fukuoka City produced its first climate change plan in 1994, placing it ahead of other local governments developing similar plans (e.g. Hiroshima, Kobe, Kyoto, Osaka) by several years. In comparison to other Japanese city contexts, Fukuoka's greenspace planning has also made rigorous attempts to consider climate change, the urban thermal environment and to work towards understanding the city's greenspace in terms of a city-wide green network, supported by research from within the government and by local institutions (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009c</xref>). The city's support for research into localised heat island effects, and subsequent utilisation of these findings to inform decisions on development of a grass area outside Fukuoka City Hall (<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>), indicates there is a willingness within government to consider urban climate issues within their governance of the built environment. Moreover, although at an early stage, it is significant that <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka Prefecture's Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan (2017)</xref> identifies the need to understand green infrastructure and ecosystem services across the Fukuoka area from now into the future.</p><p id="p0200">The ACROS Fukuoka Prefectural International Hall is an example of a location where greening has delivered local cooling and also biodiversity benefits (see <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Completed in 1995 and designed by green architecture pioneer Emilio Ambasz, ACROS features woodland on the stepped fa&#x000e7;ade of a 15-storey building (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Jim, 2017a</xref>) and is directly connected to the adjacent Tenjin Central Park. The building provides public good by containing a concert hall and government service points, as well as restaurants and office space. It is reported to host 40,000 plants and trees spanning 120 species. The ACROS terraces were not designed to provide climate or biodiversity benefits. Rather, the focus was on aesthetics, and on reducing the general environmental impact of the development (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Jim, 2017a</xref>). However, the terraces have been demonstrated to provide rainfall runoff quality benefits (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Berndtsson, Bengtsson, &#x00026; Jinno, 2009</xref>); and to deliver cooling effects in the immediate area (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hagishima, 2018</xref>). Internationally, ACROS is a well-known example of vertical greening. ACROS was featured in an article on flood risk reduction from green roofs in academic blog site <italic>The Conversation</italic> (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Howell, Drake, &#x00026; Margolis, 2017</xref>), and included in an article on green roofs and heat island mitigation in UK newspaper <italic>The Guardian</italic>'s Cities section (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">The Guardian, 2018</xref>). Both in academic literature and also public-facing material aimed at informed audiences, then, ACROS appears to be viewed internationally as a success story of climate change adaptation.<fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>ACROS Fukuoka.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0030">Fig. 6</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/><attrib>(Source: authors' own photo)</attrib></fig><fig id="f0035"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Information about biodiversity at entrance to ACROS Fukuoka.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0035">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/><attrib>(Source: authors' own photo)</attrib></fig></p><p id="p0205">Locally, signage on the terraces explains ACROS' biodiversity (authors' own visit, 2018), and the image of ACROS is frequently used in public-facing material relating to urban climate in Fukuoka (e.g. the New Green Basic Plan Summary Leaflet, (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009d</xref>)). The site hence has a symbolic role within Fukuoka in motivating action towards climate change countermeasures and urban climate protection. Since ACROS was built, other large-scale green roofs have developed in Fukuoka. The <italic>Grin Grin</italic> active learning space and botanical garden in Island City Central Park has a green roof area of 1000&#x0202f;m<sup>2</sup> over three connected buildings and opened in 2005 (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Island City Central Park, 2019</xref>). The <italic>Tenjin Core</italic> shopping centre also installed a green roof, but is scheduled to close as part of the Tenjin Big Bang intensification works. Fukuoka City Government is responsible for the <italic>Green Curtain Project</italic> and <italic>Flower City Fukuoka</italic> initiatives, which collaborate with citizens and the private sector to encourage development of green walls and localised greenery respectively.</p><p id="p0210">Indeed, another aspect in which Fukuoka has made progress in climate adaptation through the built environment is in community and citizen engagement in greening. Engagement of communities in greening strategies has been encouraged to maximise climate benefit from greening in dense cities where greenspace may be at a premium and available space may lie outside formal greenspace plans (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Mabon &#x00026; Shih, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Tan &#x00026; Jim, 2017</xref>). Engagement on community-level greening can also help to build social relations (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Tidball &#x00026; Atkipis, 2018</xref>) and hence perhaps increase resilience to future climate events. As part of the <italic>Green Curtain Project</italic>, Fukuoka City offers cash prizes for growing vertical greenery (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2016a</xref>). The competition is framed in terms of delivering cooling and reducing energy consumption, and is supported with training sessions in growing and maintaining greenery. Fukuoka City Botanical Gardens also operates a &#x02018;Green Advice Centre&#x02019; providing free technical advice to citizens and community groups wishing to develop greenery in their locale. Whilst not specifically targeted at climate adaptation or maximisation of ecosystem services, this nevertheless goes some way to addressing the lack of technical competence (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Jim, 2017b</xref>) which may act as a barrier to enhancing or maintaining urban greenery within a city.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>6.5</label><title>Challenges</title><p id="p0215">Thus far, this profile has illustrated that Fukuoka has a sound policy base for climate adaptation action through competences in greenspace and urban planning in response to environmental change. However, the extent to which this basis extends to other urban policy areas, or to tangible action, may be more limited.</p><p id="p0220">The first difficulty lies in putting the visions laid out in the city's greenspace plan fully into action. Whilst there is very good knowledge stretching over three decades of the urban climate in Fukuoka and of how it may be controlled via greening (e.g. <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hagishima, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Nitta et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Yoda &#x00026; Katayama, 1998</xref>), interventions in the built environment are perhaps limited beyond the flagship examples laid out in <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Section 6.4</xref>. For more expansive measures such as the preservation or construction of wind corridors, it is also very difficult if not impossible to remove or alter existing buildings along the seafront (interview with KEEA, April 2018). The data presented in <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Section 5.2</xref> indicates that Fukuoka's continuing growth is putting pressure on green spaces, with a declining trend in green coverage at the time of the last greenspace planning cycle. Nonetheless, this is recognised by the city, and the inclusion of more green and open spaces within the city's formal greenspace system &#x02013; as well as city government-led initiatives such as the <italic>Green Curtain Project</italic> and <italic>Flower City Fukuoka</italic> &#x02013; indicate efforts to re-establish greening as part of adaptation efforts.</p><p id="p0225">The second challenge represents the observations of <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al. (2017)</xref> that compartmentalisation of government bureaus may be a barrier to local climate adaptation progression in Japan. Whilst the Fukuoka City Urban Planning Masterplan and the Fukuoka City New Green Basic Plan both come under the remit of the Housing Division, the Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan falls under the remit of the Environment Division. These local government divisions themselves report to different sections of national government. Housing is connected to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport; and Environment to Ministry of Environment. Interviewed local government officials acknowledged there are initiatives to link different areas of local government through periodical face-to-face forums and also the connection of policies and plans to each other, but also that greenspace and climate adaptation plans do to an extent develop in silos (interview with Fukuoka City Environment Division, May 2017; interview with Fukuoka City Government Green City Promotion Department, April 2018). At the prefectural level, the <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka Prefecture Climate Change Countermeasures Action Plan (2017)</xref> does however assign the identified tasks relating to climate change to specific prefectural government sections and departments. This may represent a move towards the &#x0201c;integrated adaptation strategy for the whole local government&#x0201d; which <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Baba et al. (2017: 10)</xref> believe is missing in Japan at present.</p><p id="p0230">Third, there is a potential tension in Fukuoka between economic development and environmental protection. Fukuoka has the highest growth rate of local tax revenue (4.2% between 2008 and 2015) of all major cities in Japan, and the fastest-growing population of major Japanese cities (7.1% between 2010 and 2017) (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka Asian Urban Research Center, 2018</xref>). Partly in response to this growth and associated demand for office and hotel space, Fukuoka City Government has initiated the &#x02018;Tenjin Big Bang&#x02019; project described in <xref rid="s0025" ref-type="sec">Section 5</xref>. The Tenjin Big Bang regulations do incentivise pro-environmental actions in redevelopment by granting an increase in floor-area ratio for reduction of environmental impact (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Government, 2018c</xref>). This may help to encourage greening, given that Fukuoka City Government has tried, so far without success, to include greening actions within building codes due to perceived conflict with economic development (interview with Fukuoka City Government Green City Promotion Department, April 2018). However, although there is no clear opposition in Fukuoka yet, similar experiences in Taipei indicate that if not managed sensitively, such initiatives to engage developers in urban greening initiatives can backfire and/or be met with scepticism by pro-environmental and civil society stakeholders if they are perceived as giving developers too much power in planning processes (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Mabon &#x00026; Shih, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0235">There are also challenges in Fukuoka which reflect the general adaptation situation for Japanese cities. These include the still strong focus on mitigation compared to adaptation in the <italic>Cool and Adapt Project</italic>, which tallies with <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Kameyama's (2016)</xref> general observation on Japanese municipal climate policy. Respondents also commented (interview with KEEA, April 2018) that the conditions of government-funded projects sometimes made data sharing or re-use for further research into local climate adaptation difficult, an observation also made for Tokyo by <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Hijioka et al. (2016)</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0070"><label>7</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0240">This City Profile has illustrated that within Japan, Fukuoka has made relatively early progress on local governance of climate change adaptation, particular as regards consideration of specific implementation actions when compared to cities in western Japan of similar size and climate. What is perhaps most distinctive is that there is in Fukuoka a robust body of scientific evidence produced by local scholars and institutions on which municipal policymakers may draw to support their decisions. Our profile also supports the argument that whilst climate change adaptation may be a relatively new area for local governments in Japan, there are already comprehensive policy frameworks in place in areas such as environmental protection, disaster prevention, and appropriately-informed greenspace planning which can act as a foundation to facilitate actions necessary for climate adaptation (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Hijioka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Morimoto, 2011</xref>). In Fukuoka, greenspace planning policies appear particularly well-suited to adapting to the effects of increased heat and rainfall, in that explicit consideration of climate adaptation may be considered only the latest iteration in the city of a much longer policy and research interest into how the urban green environment can be configured to create a &#x02018;liveable environment&#x02019; for citizens.</p><p id="p0245">Nonetheless, there are limitations to the applicability of Fukuoka's experience with climate adaptation to other international cities. Whilst Fukuoka is indeed an expanding, subtropical, medium-sized city in Asia, the current and historical context makes it a distinctive and in some ways anomalous case. The strong technical and scientific competences in understanding the local environment held by local institutions and researchers in Fukuoka, and the associated drive to connect this with policy-making and undertake research in the public interest, may to an extent be the result of Kyushu's specific historical experiences with pollution. Fukuoka is also a large, well-resourced and still-growing city in a wealthy country context. This may afford the city access to funds to support the development of comprehensive climate and environmental policies, and also aid the recruitment and training of technically capable local government staff. Whether such actions would be possible to the same extent in other rapidly developing subtropical Asian cities without this level of resourcing and the specific social and environmental history is open to question.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0285">Hiroyuki Kanekiyo was a member of the Academic Expert Committee for the <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Urban Planning Masterplan (2014)</xref>.
