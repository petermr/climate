<p>The NECN Succession extension simulates regeneration, growth, and mortality of trees, wood and litter decomposition, soil accumulation and decomposition, and available soil water (Scheller et al.

 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). NECN tracks all pools and fluxes of carbon and nitrogen as well as the biomass in each species/age cohort in all cells. NECN uses species and ecoregion parameters to define how cohort growth is affected by soil and climate (Data 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Maximum biomass and maximum aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were defined for each species and each ecoregion. In addition to species‐specific parameters that outline many physiological characteristics (Data 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), NECN succession further organizes species into functional groups. This classification helps dictate tree growth responses to environmental conditions, with many parameters inherited from the Century model (Parton et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Probability of establishment, which dictates the likelihood of successful regeneration, is the product of species‐specific traits and environmental and edaphic conditions. As cohorts grow, they compete for resources within each cell and can disperse across grid cells. Cohorts die when they reach species longevity values or are killed by disturbance (i.e., harvest or fire). Some species, functional group, and NECN parameters used in this study were taken from similar studies that used the same or similar species (Scheller et al.
