<p>We used the Biomass Harvest extension to simulate the 4FRI thinning prescriptions and prescribed fire prescriptions. Biomass Harvest requires the landscape to be divided into “management units,” within which targets are defined for the amount of area treated. We divided the landscape into six management units based on the prescriptions that were to be placed there. We developed 15 LANDIS‐II prescriptions based on the prescriptions used by USFS (
 <italic>unpublished data</italic>) in the 4FRI restoration project: grassland prescriptions that removed all trees; savanna prescriptions that removed most trees; nine prescriptions that removed ponderosa pine at various levels; and four prescribed fire prescriptions that included initial prescribed fire and maintenance prescribed fire for grasslands, savannas, and the remaining project area (Data

To realistically simulate current and anticipated management across the 4FRI landscape, we designed our management prescriptions to mimic the thinning practices used by managers, including age and diameter targets for individual species. Because LANDIS‐II is a cohort‐based model and cannot simulate individual tree removal, we then used expected pre‐ and post‐treatment condition 4FRI data from the USFS (
 <italic>unpublished data</italic>) to estimate the biomass removed from each cohort in each prescription in LANDIS‐II (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1979-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The Dynamic Fire extension is best suited for simulating wildfire effects, therefore we used the Biomass Harvest extension to simulate prescribed fires. As is designed for 4FRI, we implemented prescribed maintenance fires to continue after initial thinning and prescribed fire (10 or 20 yr, depending on scenario).
