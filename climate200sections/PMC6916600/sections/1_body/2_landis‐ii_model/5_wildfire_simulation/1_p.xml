<p>We used the Dynamic Fuel extension to assign fuel types to the landscape based on dominant species/age structure in each 100‐m grid cell. Fuel types influence the spread and severity of wildfire on the landscape. Fuel types can change with every time step and are reassigned if species composition and ages change (via growth or disturbance) in a cell from the previous time step. We used 12 pre‐disturbance fuel types based on species and ages that were expected to burn similarly (Data

We also used five post‐disturbance fuel types that had increased crown base height, and thus lower fire severity, because we expected that treatment would alter the vertical structure of the trees on the landscape (Graham et al.
