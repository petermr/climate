<p>To calibrate the Dynamic Fire extension, we ran the simulations for 30 yr with historical climate input for growth and fire weather and compared the mean fire size, standard deviation of the fire size, fire return interval, and area burned per year for each fire region to fires from a fire database (Short

 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Table S1). We prioritized area burned per year over the other metrics in the calibration to ensure that it was similar to historical data. The average area burned across the project area in the historic database was 3,387 ha/yr and in the LANDIS‐II calibrations was 3,651 ha/yr (Appendix
