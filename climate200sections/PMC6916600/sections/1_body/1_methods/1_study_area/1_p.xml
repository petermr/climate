<p>The study area was the initial phase of 4FRI, ~400,000 ha of the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests including the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona, USA (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We included the entire footprint of 4FRI Phase 1 in our study but the actual 4FRI EIS did not include some areas within that footprint, as they already had separate, previously approved restoration plans that were similar in scope to 4FRI. We simulated restoration of the entire project area following the methods used by USFS for the 4FRI restoration.
