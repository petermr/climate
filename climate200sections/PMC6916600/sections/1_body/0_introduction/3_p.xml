<p>Restoration of forest structure (mechanical thinning) and processes (prescribed fire) is one of the few adaptation strategies available to forest managers. Because 4FRI's goal is to accelerate the pace of restoration across tens of thousands of hectares, 4FRI presents a rare opportunity to evaluate the extent to which restoration efforts aimed at restoring fire regimes can also be applied as mitigation strategies to stabilize carbon under climate change. Previous studies have projected that restoration under climate change will result in long‐term increases in forest carbon due to reductions in wildfire activity (Loudermilk et al.

Mediated in part by low regeneration rates under warmer temperatures, other studies have projected that extreme climate change will result in forest type changes, biomass loss, and deforestation despite restoration treatments (Tarancón et al.
