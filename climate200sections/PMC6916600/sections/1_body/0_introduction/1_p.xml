<p>In recent decades, the western United States has seen an increase in the frequency, size, and severity of wildfires (Dillon et al.

 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). A century of fire suppression, along with a warmer climate, below‐average winter precipitation, and earlier spring snowmelt, has contributed to this increase (Abatzoglou and Williams

This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the southwestern United States, where the trend of warmer temperatures and extended droughts are projected to increase in the future. Climate‐induced changes are expected to lead to increased tree mortality due to drought stress, insect outbreaks, and larger and more severe wildfires (Williams et al.
