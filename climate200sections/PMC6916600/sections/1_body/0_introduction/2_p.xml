There is an urgent need to accelerate the pace and scale of restoration in forests across the western United States to reduce vulnerability to catastrophic wildfire and improve resilience to climate change. As a response, the U.S. Congress authorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) in the 2009 Omnibus Public Lands Management Act to accelerate restoration in high‐priority landscapes (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service

The largest landscape to receive funding and begin implementation, referred to as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), is an effort to restore fire‐adapted ponderosa pine forests across four national forests in northern Arizona. Using a collaborative science‐based process, an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the first phase of 4FRI was approved in 2015, to restore significant portions of the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service
