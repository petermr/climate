<p>The objective of this study was to explore how the pace of restoration in ponderosa pine forests under a large‐scale restoration program would influence carbon dynamics and wildfire severity given projected changes in climate. Specifically, we estimated forest carbon fluxes and pools and wildfire severity under a moderate and rapid 4FRI implementation schedule and compared those to status quo restoration and no harvest using the LANDIS‐II simulation model. This study had several unique features that add value to previous efforts. It was one of the few that was conducted at a large‐scale and under an accelerated pace of restoration. Additionally, we incorporated U.S. Forest Service's (USFS) 4FRI implementation plan, with initial thinning prescriptions followed by maintenance fire into the LANDIS‐II model to match, as closely as possible, the actual restoration underway in the forests for the next several decades. Finally, we estimated the fate of carbon from harvested products and the resulting storage/emissions. In comparison to status quo restoration and no harvest, we hypothesized that ecosystem carbon would initially decline under accelerated thinning and prescribed fire but subsequently increase by reducing fuel loads available for wildfires under warmer and drier conditions caused by climate change.</p>
