<p>We conducted a separate analysis evaluating the fate of carbon from the harvested products in this region. LANDIS‐II assumes all harvested material is removed from the ecosystem and we believe that assumption is valid in this region with the current wood product types. Our results suggest that there is little net gain in carbon from harvested material because the amount of carbon sequestered in wood products at the end of the study timeframe was roughly equivalent to the emissions from the equipment and transport vehicles used during the harvest. Most of the wood products in this region were pallets (55%) with a carbon half‐life of only 6 yr but if the harvested biomass were converted to longer‐lasting wood products, we would expect that this number would substantially increase (Finkral and Evans

 <sup>−2</sup>·yr
 <sup>−1</sup> for the first 20 yr, including immediate emissions (material burned at processing) and decomposition over time (chipped and residual biomass). This indicates that the 4FRI landscapes were likely a greater source of carbon to the atmosphere during the first 20–30 yr than shown in the LANDIS‐II results (Fig.
