<p>Potential gains in TEC in the fast‐4FRI scenario compared to the no‐harvest scenario were the result of greater productivity, explaining ~30% of the increases, and a reduction in wildfire emissions, explaining ~70% of the increases. Production increases were apparent in the 4FRI scenarios subsequent to initial thinning and prescribed fire (10 or 20 yr, depending on the scenario) and growth continued to remain higher in the 4FRI scenarios for ~50 yr. Additionally, smaller proportions of the landscape burned at high severity as the pace of restoration increased, resulting in lower tree mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the case of ponderosa pine, for example, the low and low‐moderate fire severity categories that occurred more frequently in the 4FRI scenarios killed only trees &lt;10 yr old, whereas the moderate–high and high severity categories, that occurred more frequently in the no‐harvest scenario, killed all trees &lt;80 and &lt;340 yr old (nearly all the trees in most sites), respectively.
