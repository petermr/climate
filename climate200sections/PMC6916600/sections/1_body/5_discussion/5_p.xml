<p>Still other studies found that, despite restoration efforts, extreme climate change conditions could result in significant biomass losses and deforestation (Tarancón et al.

 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). We also saw decreases in TEC and aboveground biomass in the no‐harvest and status quo scenarios implying that without restoration there is a strong likelihood that forest biomass will decline with climate change due to high severity fires and low productivity. Additionally, our study found lower recruitment across all scenarios with extreme increases in temperature (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S12), implying that, despite restoration efforts, biomass loss is still possible. We found similar vegetation type changes as Loehman et al. (2018) in a similar time frame but Flatley and Fulé (
