<p>While the pace of restoration influenced wildfire severity in this study, neither restoration nor climate change significantly affected area burned per year (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S10). We believe this is an artefact of how the LANDIS‐II Dynamic Fire extension fits wildfire sizes to a lognormal distribution that cannot be altered with changing climatic conditions. This distribution shortens the right‐side tail of the fire size distribution in such a way that large wildfires that have already occurred and larger fires that are predicted to occur (Kitzberger et al.

 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) are not simulated. However, despite the limitations of LANDIS‐II to model it, warming‐induced increases in wildfire size will likely occur (Westerling 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and result in higher carbon emissions. Restoration treatments, including prescribed fire, will remain important for reducing fire severity, but may not consistently reduce wildfire size (Cochrane et al.
