<p>Scientific evidence has shown changes in climate and experience of these changes are notable. Rivers are drying up, droughts are common and famers are experiencing shorter growing seasons with dry spells. Peasant farmers have noted the changes through observations of birdsâ€™ behaviour and the flowering pattern of particular trees which is used to dictate and predict droughts. Natural occurrences such as the appearance of certain birds, the abundance of fruits and flowering of certain plants to forecast weather is commonly used in Zvimba and it indicates the quantity of rain expected. The observations and information determine the timing of growing of crops and what to plant. Integrating indigenous adaptation methods with scientific ones can be effective if community members are allowed to participate fully. The adaptation strategies that were pointed out by community members in the study area are based on indigenous knowledge (IK) systems and shared knowledge. Farmers learnt lessons from previous climatic experiences and use them to enhance their adaptive capacity. Chanza (

IK is embedded in local cultures through community interaction and contributes to the adaptive capacity when facing the impacts of climate change. Zvimba community has experts who are capable and have knowledge to undertake and maintain long-term climate observation. These experts are elders of the community who rely on traditional knowledge and oral history to observe and monitor weather changes. Many indigenous communities around the world have already reported some adverse impacts from changing climate conditions within their ecosystems on which they depend on (Saitabau 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Local people have wealth of knowledge which needs to be built on as this helps in making adaptation strategies to be locally appropriate. In the past decade, NGOs have introduced adaptation strategies that were short lived and not sustainable mainly because locals were left out. The successful implementation of adaptation strategies needs to come from the community whilst the private sector and NGOs act as supporting mechanism in coordinating them. In this regard, the bottom-up approach needs to be fully integrated at all cost. Peasant farmers in Zvimba are applying their local knowledge to innovate new adaptive measures in response to the changing climate. This highlights the importance of indigenous weather prediction knowledge as timely warning of impending events as one of the best strategies for mitigating impacts of such events.
