 <caption> Climate change impacts on species geographic distributions. The magnitude of spatial displacements of range centroid between species with different parity mode ( a), and the same measure among ‘parity-by-taxonomy’ groups ( b). ( c) Elevational shifts between species with different parity mode and ( d) among ‘parity-by-taxonomy’ groups. Model results represent the minimum (RCP 2.6) and maximum (RCP 8.5) emission based on GISS-ER and MIROC5 climate models. Where, ( a, c) show the results of the Independent-sample t-test, while b) and d) represent the Gabriel’s post hoc test results. For both analyses, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
