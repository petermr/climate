<p id="Par5">Here, we present a comprehensive test of the cul-de-sac hypothesis, based on fine-scale distributional data spanning three prolific and evolutionarily contrasting lizard radiations that have diversified in the Andes and adjacent areas in South America. Their natural histories span all scenarios of parity mode variation: 
 <italic>Liolaemus</italic>, with 270+ species is the world’s second most diverse genus of living amniotes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>, in which viviparity has evolved in several independent phylogenetic events
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>; 
 <italic>Phymaturus</italic>, a strictly cold-climate, viviparous genus of 60+ species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>; finally, 
 <italic>Stenocercus</italic> consists of 60+ oviparous species, despite their distributions up to above 4000 m in the Andes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. Using an ecological niche modeling framework and future climate scenarios (IPPC Fifth Assessment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>) we tested whether viviparous (relative to oviparous) species (
 <italic>i</italic>) are predicted to experience greater range contractions, (
 <italic>ii</italic>) higher overall spatial displacements, and (
 <italic>iii</italic>) greater displacement towards higher elevations in relation with oviparous species.
