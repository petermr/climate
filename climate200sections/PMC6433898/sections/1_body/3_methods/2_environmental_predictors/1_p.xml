<p id="Par15">To analyse the environmental space occupied by lizard lineages, we used the bioclimatic variables characterizing climate during the 1970–2000 period, obtained from the WorldClim 2 data repository

To reduce collinearity between the environmental variables, we used VIF (Variance Inflation Factors) implemented in the “usdm” R-package

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup>. Using this approach, we excluded all the highly correlated variables from the model (VIF greater than 10), which is associated with a signal that the model has a collinearity problem
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. This method is based on the square of the multiple correlation coefficient (

 <sup>2</sup>) resulting from regressing the predictor variable against all other predictor variables. We used the remaining uncorrelated variables to calibrate models: mean annual temperature (bio1), mean diurnal range (bio2), isothermality (bio3), temperature seasonality (bio4), max temperature of warmest month (bio5), min temperature of coldest month (bio6), temperature annual range (bio7), mean temperature of warmest quarter (bio10), mean temperature of coldest quarter (bio11), annual precipitation (bio12) precipitation of wettest month (bio13), precipitation of driest month (bio14), and precipitation seasonality (bio15), precipitation of wettest quarter (bio16), and precipitation of driest quarter (bio17).
