<p id="Par18">Based on the occurrence data (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), we calibrated Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) to estimate current and future potential distribution for each lizard species. To mitigate oversampling effects in our model, occurrences were re-sampled to one point per pixel with respect to the environmental grids. Coordinates were divided into two groups for calibration and other evaluation, based on four quadrants with similar numbers of points, using two off-diagonal quadrants for calibration and two for evaluation. ENMs were developed using Maxent 3.3.3k

 </sup>, a presence-background software that estimates environmental suitability via an index of similarity that resembles a heterogeneous occurrence process or logistic regression function
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. We used Maxent with clamping and extrapolation turned off (i.e., no prediction outside the range of environmental conditions in the calibration areas). To facilitate interpretations, we used the relative probability of presence as a proxy of environmental suitability

 </sup>. Suitable area for each species was estimated as a Boolean (presence/absence) map that was thresholded based on the minimum training presence

 </sup>. To determine the model parametrization with the best fit to the data available, we assessed six models for each species under different regularization multiplier values (i.e., 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20)

 </sup>. Then, we assessed AIC (Akaike Information Criterion; implemented in ENMTools
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup>) values to choose the model with the best performance (i.e., descriptive-model evaluation; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). Once the models with the best fit were selected, we assessed their performance using the software PartialROC
