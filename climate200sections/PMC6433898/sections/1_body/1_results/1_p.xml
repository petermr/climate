<p id="Par6">Our ecological niche model (ENM) analyses reveal that the geographic ranges and their changes are predominantly influenced by temperature-related variables across all three lineages (in 93.7% of the species), while precipitation-related variables tend to be considerably less relevant (only dominant in 6.3% of the species; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Also, we found that potential impacts of climate change on species ranges were not evenly distributed across space. Range expansions and contractions were more likely in certain regions (e.g., the high Andes), and absent from other regions (e.g., Patagonian steppe, Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in Southern Chile; Moran’s spatial autocorrelation index &gt;0.7, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Such range shifts patterns were observed consistently in viviparous species (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a,b</xref>). Although MIROC5-based models supported the hypothesis of a geographic directionality in the spatial shifts (Rayleigh’s test range, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05–0.01), GISS-ER-based models showed centroid shifts that were not distinguishable from uniform (Fig.
