 <caption> The spatial scale for local water budget closure ( L WB —for which precipitation roughly equals evaporation) as a function of the degree of closure (i.e., the level of similarity between P and E) from the different models and reanalysis data sets. The different data sets presented here are Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5(RCP8.5) simulations, reanalysis data sets of European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and additional simulations using the icosahedral nonhydrostatic (ICON) model with and without land (ICON‐AMIP and ICON‐aqua, respectively). The vertical lines in the CMIP5 curves represent the standard deviation of the 39 different models. </caption>
