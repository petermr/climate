 <caption> Multimodel mean spatial correlation between changes in precipitation ( δP) and changes in evaporation ( δE) between the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5(RCP8.5) simulations and the historical simulations as a function of the spatial scale of averaging. It was calculated by first averaging δP and δE over a given length scale ( x axis) and then calculating the spatial correlation between them. The vertical lines present the standard deviation of the different models. The black lines mark the length scale at which the correlation crosses the 0.5 value. </caption>
