 <caption> Precipitation minus evaporation ( P − E [kg/s/m 2]) at different spatial scales. The top row shows the native model resolution; the subsequent rows are averaged over a circle centered at each grid point with the given radius indicated in the title. The lower row presents the scale [km] for which the water budget is closed to within 10%, that is, ( P − E)/ P &lt; 0.1 − L WB (10%). The left column presents the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data, while the right column presents an example of one model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical runs (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with Modular Ocean Model 4 component [GFDL‐ESM 2M]; Dunne et al., 2012). </caption>
