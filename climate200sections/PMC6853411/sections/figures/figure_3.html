 <caption> Examples from two Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5(CMIP5) models of the changes in precipitation ( δP [kg/s/m 2]) at different spatial scales. The top row shows the native model resolution; the subsequent rows are averaged over a circle centered at each grid point with the given radius indicated in the title. The left column presents the results from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with Modular Ocean Model 4 component (GFDL‐ESM 2M) model (Dunne et al., 2012), while the right column presents the results from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies E2‐R (GISS‐E2‐R) model (Schmidt et al., 2014). </caption>
