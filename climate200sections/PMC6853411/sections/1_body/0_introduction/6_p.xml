<p>The above argument can also be put in a more commonly used perspective of thermodynamics vs. dynamics contributions to changes in precipitation (which has some similarities but is not identical to the water budget perspective presented above; Allen &amp; Ingram,

 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>)). It is argued that the main contributions to precipitation changes are changes in air temperature and hence in water vapor amount in the atmosphere (thermodynamics contribution), and changes in the atmospheric circulation (dynamic contribution). On increasingly large to global scales, the dynamic contribution vanishes and the thermodynamics contribution dominates. However, on smaller scales the dynamic contribution can dominate (Chadwick et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Weller et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). This, again, implies the existence of a breakdown scale of the causes deriving precipitation changes. Our aim is to identify on what spatial scales one should expect a large dynamic contribution (or large contribution from changes in div (
