<p>It demonstrates, as expected, that at the centre of a region of negative/positive 
 <italic>P</italic> − 
 <italic>E</italic> the scale needed to average over for closure of the water budget is larger, while near a transition between net 
 <italic>P</italic> to net 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> is lower. Hence, the emerging pattern of 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> reproduces the features in the eastern parts of the subtropical oceans and a sharp transition around ±40°. At high latitudes, beyond 40°, the small net precipitation is driven by a water vapor supply from lower latitudes; consequently, 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> is generally larger. Hereafter, we will focus on the region between −40 and 40°. In addition, we note that using a specific threshold (in this case 10%) may generate a sharp transition of scales at specific locations.
