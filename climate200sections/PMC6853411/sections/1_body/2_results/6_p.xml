<p>There is a large spread among CMIP5 models in the spatial pattern of precipitation change projections (Knutti &amp; Sedláček, 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). However, similar to the 
 <italic>P</italic>−
 <italic>E</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), when averaged over increasingly large scale, the pattern of 
 <italic>δP</italic> becomes weaker and almost completely vanish on scales larger than 3,000 km.
