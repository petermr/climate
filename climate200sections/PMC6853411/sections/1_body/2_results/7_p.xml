<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> presents the spatial correlation between the changes in precipitation (
 <italic>δP</italic>) and changes in evaporation (
 <italic>δE</italic>) between the RCP8.5 simulations and the historical simulations, averaged at different scales. It demonstrates a monotonic increase in correlation with the spatial scale from ~0.1 at the native resolution (1°×1°) to above 0.8 at 10,000 km resolution. This pattern suggests that indeed at small spatial scales, 
 <italic>δP</italic> is not similar to 
 <italic>δE</italic>, and changes in div (
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>v</italic>
 </sub>) dominate (equation 
 <xref rid="grl59514-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>). However, once averaged over larger spatial scales, the role of div (
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>v</italic>
 </sub>) in determining precipitation changes decreases. The correlation between 
 <italic>δP</italic> and 
 <italic>δE</italic> becomes larger than 0.5 at ~3,600 km, comparable to the scale needed to close the water budget to within less than 10% (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A similar trend of correlation between 
 <italic>δP</italic> and changes in the atmospheric radiative budget was shown by Muller and O'Gorman (
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In addition, it was recently shown that the tropics reach radiative convective equilibrium on scales of ~5,000 km (Jakob et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Some similarities between the scales of constraining precipitation changes due to the water and energy budget are expected due to their coupling. However, these potential connections should be investigated in depth in future work.
