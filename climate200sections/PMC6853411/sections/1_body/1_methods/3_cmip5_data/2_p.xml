<p>Precipitation and evaporation fields from 39 CMIP5 models (listed in Table 
 <xref rid="grl59514-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> in the 
 <xref rid="grl59514-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">supporting information</xref>) are used from two scenarios: historical and RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; Riahi et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) simulations. For each scenario, average fields over 20 years are used. Form the historical runs we use the last 20 years of the 20th century. From the RCP8.5 runs we use the last 20 years of the 21st century. The scale in which the water budget is locally closed (precipitation minus evaporation [
 <italic>P</italic> − 
 <italic>E</italic>] close to 0) is determined based on the historical simulations (and compared to the scale from the RCP8.5 simulations), while changes in precipitation (
 <italic>δP</italic>) and evaporation (
 <italic>δE</italic>) are determined based on the difference between the RCP8.5 and the historical runs. In these simulations, 
 <italic>δP</italic> and 
 <italic>δE</italic> are forced by a combination of greenhouse gases, aerosol and land use changes. All data are remapped to 1°×1° resolution.
