<p>Using CMIP5 RCP8.5 and historical simulations, we show that changes in precipitation are not well correlated with changes in evaporation at spatial scales smaller than 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub>(10%), suggesting a large contribution from changes in water vapor divergence. However, once averaged over larger scales, the correlation monotonically increases up to ~0.8 when averaged over 10,000 km (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The correlation between 
 <italic>δP</italic> and 
 <italic>δE</italic> crosses the 0.5 level for spatial scale of ~3,600 km, similar to 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub>(10%). The increase in correlation suggests that on scales &gt;3,600 km, changes in precipitation are no longer dominated by changes in the divergence term. The fundamental argument presented here could be used to understand and predict spatial scales of future precipitation changes, which could have a significant impact on society. For example, it demonstrates that changes in precipitation on the continental scale could be much larger and less constrained than the global mean change.
