<p>We constructed species distribution models (SDMs) using climate data for current and future 2080 climate conditions. For the future climate condition, we used four scenarios: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 (in order of increasing gas concentration). SDMs were constructed using MAXENT (

We correlated occurrence points with 10 climatic variables and used 75% of data for training purposes and 25% model performance. We obtained the model from 10 replicates and a cross-validation procedure for replicate adjustment. Both training and test models obtained area under the curve (AUC) values. For SDM regularization, we selected the average model.
