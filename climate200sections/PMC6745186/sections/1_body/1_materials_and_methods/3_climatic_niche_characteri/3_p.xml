<p>Finally, we related the climatic niche results with the size of the refugia and expansion area of each species using generalized lineal models (GLM). For this, we used niche breadth variance (niche breadth) and niche position variance (niche similarity). Refugia and expansion area were the dependent variables, and niche similarity and breadth were the predictor variables.</p>
