<p>To assess niche properties, we selected variables that account for the minimum and maximum ranges of the precipitation and temperature (i.e., the minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the wettest month, precipitation of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the driest quarter) to describe niche breadth as niche tolerance (
