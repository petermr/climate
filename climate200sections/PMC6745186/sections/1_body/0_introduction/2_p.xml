<p>The responses of organisms to climate change are limited and depend on the speed and intensity of climate change, as well as on biological variables such as physiological tolerance, morpho-functional traits, and life history (

 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan &amp; Hanley, 2015</xref>). Predictions of ongoing climate change suggest that abiotic variables will be substantially altered in large geographic areas in a short time period, and species may not be able to adapt to these new conditions (

 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Wiens, 2016</xref>). Moreover, the dispersal potential of many species is limited, particularly in low-mobility groups such as terrestrial plants (

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Dullinger, Dirnböck &amp; Grabherr, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Dullinger et al., 2015</xref>), and few studies have shown models of dispersion that favor species distribution (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Alarcón &amp; Cavieres, 2015</xref>). Besides, dispersal of propagules is heavily constrained by habitat destruction and human-induced changes in land use (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Hermy &amp; Verheyen, 2007</xref>), which act as steadfast barriers to the movement of propagules between unconnected biotopes.
