<p>We believe that for species with narrow climatic niches, the presence of climate refugia can be subject to the magnitude of climate change in their geographic area. 
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Alarcón &amp; Cavieres (2018)</xref> found a positive relationship between niche breadth and change in species’ distribution with increasing elevation; however, as the latitude increases, the relationship is reversed, and species with wide niches present greater changes in their distribution, which reaffirms the idea that the niche breadth–refugia relationship could be modified by the magnitude of change in a specific geographical area. It is important to incorporate other factors, such as latitude or gradients in future studies.
