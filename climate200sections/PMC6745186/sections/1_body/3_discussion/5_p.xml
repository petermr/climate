<p>By detecting areas of possible expansion for species distribution, it is possible to propose areas that could potentially benefit from conservation efforts and ecological restoration, as reforestation with those species that present expansion in those areas (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Padonou et al., 2015</xref>) and human-assisted introductions to maximize the native forests’ connectivity (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Hannah et al., 2008</xref>), could attenuate the impact generated by the contraction of natural species distribution. This conservation method is currently being incorporated for conservation planning and ecological restoration (
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Ardestani et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Remya, Ramachandran &amp; Jayakumar, 2015</xref>). In our case, this could be very useful for arid lineages, due to the intensification of mining activity in the western Andes (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Cisternas &amp; Gálvez, 2014</xref>), and this study could serve as the impetus for initiating restoration in that area. Proposing areas of expansion for these arid lineages would counteract the effect of global change and, in turn, fill gaps in conservation, as in the case of groups such as cacti, which are poorly conserved in non-take areas (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Duarte et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, areas of both refugia and expansion could be subject to concrete conservation efforts, and they may also be used in environmental policies and conservation planning.
