<p>This work provides new knowledge on which properties could define the future distribution of species throughout the course of global climate change. We have found that species with a broad niche and niche similarity will have a larger refuge. In addition, those species with niche similarity will have larger expansion areas than species with low similarity. The species evaluated belong to semi-arid ecosystems, which seldom been evaluated in relation to their future distribution. Our prediction in arid lineages shows that these species will be moderately affected by climate change. For this reason, we suggest taking conservative measures to protect these lineages in the places where they are currently distributed, which will serve as future areas of refuge in the face of climate change.</p>
