<p>We characterized the niche of the species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Appendix 2</xref>). For temperature axes, we found species currently occupying from −12.2 °C to 31.4 °C; for annual precipitation, we found species occupying from 0 mm to 1,104 mm. The spatial analyses indicated that current and future (refugia) species distribution areas were significantly different (
