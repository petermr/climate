<p>Spatial analyses indicated that the suitable habitat area for species distribution demonstrated reductions of 0%–99.8% for the 2.6 model, 0%–93.9% for the 4.5 model, 0%–100% for the 6.0 model, and 0%–100% for the 8.5 model. We found a potential expansion area of 0%–224.7% for the 2.6 model, 0%–461.1% for the 4.5 model, 0%–406.8% for the 6.0 model and 0%–828.8% for the 8.5 model. The 2.6 model showed one possible extinction (
 <italic>N. intonsa</italic>) and another species refugia between 0.02%–100%. The 4.5 model showed a 6.10%–100% refugia area; the 6.0 model showed one possible extinction (
 <italic>E. iquiquensis</italic>) and 0%–100% refugia area; and the 8.5 model showed one possible extinction (
 <italic>L. purpurea</italic>) and 0%–100% refugia area. Therefore, the least conservative scenario for the three measures used (contraction, refugia, and distribution expansion) is the 8.5 model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>), which shows high percentages of contraction (up to 100%), narrow climatic refugia (from 0%), and high expansion values (up to 828.8% of the current distribution).
