<p>Significant relationships between temperature niche similarity and the size of refugia were detected for all SDMs (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The GLM analysis indicated a positive relationship between temperature niche similarity and the four emission scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5), and a positive effect between niche breadth in temperature and the two emission scenarios (6.0 and 8.5). Moreover, we detected positive relationships between niche similarity in temperature for all models and expansion areas (
