<p id="Par4">The sudden switch from meandering to braided rivers at the PTB was reported independently

 </sup> from the Karoo Basin in South Africa, and the same explanation given. In a review
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, similar sedimentary switches from low- to high-energy systems were noted also in Australia, Spain and possibly China (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The Chinese records to date were limited, however. Higher proportions of brecciated volcanic materials are common at the PTB in various terrestrial sections in South China

 </sup>. These correspond to a colour shift from olive, grey or multi-coloured sandstones and mudstones of the coal-bearing uppermost Permian to maroon and purple interbedded sandstones and mudstones of the Early Triassic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. The earliest Triassic sediments are characterized by frequently occurring scours, poorly sorted syngenetic breccias and calcareous siltstone nodules, suggesting a dramatic collapse of soil systems near the PTB in South China
