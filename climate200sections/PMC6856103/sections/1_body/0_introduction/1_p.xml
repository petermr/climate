 </sup> which involves massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia and associated emissions of greenhouse gases causing warming of land and oceans, stagnation and ocean floor anoxia, associated with acid rain that stripped the landscape of plants and soils and acidified the oceans. The sharp warming pulse of some 15 °C drove life from the tropics, loss of forests and soils deprived land life of food, and acidification of the oceans caused stress for calcifying marine organisms
