 </sup> from the Permian-Triassic red bed successions of European Russia, where systems of predominantly cyclical, climate-driven, fine-grained deposits of lakes and meandering streams were supplanted by massive conglomerates deriving from huge alluvial fans up to 900 km long. The massive conglomerates were taken as marking the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), and so coinciding with the extinction crisis; this was confirmed by biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic work

 </sup>. But what was the cause? Russian geologists had interpreted the sedimentary switch as evidence for the renewal of regional tectonics, and uplift of the Ural Mountains, from which the sediment was derived. They had also considered the idea that the sudden switch from meandering to braided streams indicated increased rainfall, but all evidence indicated increasing aridity across the boundary. Newell and colleagues

 </sup> showed there was no independent evidence for tectonic activity in the Urals, and so explained the sudden influx of masses of sediment as a result of the reduction of vegetation that had long been recognized in the subsequent ‘coal gap’, the 10 Myr time span in the Early and Middle Triassic
