<p id="Par11">The late Early Triassic Heshanggou Formation is dominated by shallow lacustrine deposits, characterized by cycles of siltstones and/or mudstones interbedded with a few thin fine-medium grained sandstone layers. Bioturbation in the Heshanggou Formation becomes stronger from the bottom to top, suggesting biological recovery after the extinction near the PTB
