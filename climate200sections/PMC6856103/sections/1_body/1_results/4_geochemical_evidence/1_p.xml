<p id="Par13">Diagenetic alteration of the elemental and isotopic elements in ancient carbonates and mudstones can obliterate primary depositional trends and therefore these require an adequate assessment. The Mn/Sr ratio has been regarded as a sensitive indicator of diagenetic alteration in carbonates

 </sup> suggested that samples with Mn/Sr &lt; 2–3 were unaltered, later work has suggested that samples with values as high as 10 still produced reliable carbon isotope signatures
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. The Mn/Sr ratio yields values of 0.61–6.48 in this study (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) and most of them were &lt;3, which suggest these samples were nearly unaltered, so they preserve primary depositional characteristics. Moreover, the carbon and oxygen isotope cross-plot (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) shows no obvious positive linear relationship between δ
 <sup>18</sup>O and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C values, and data points are relatively discrete, indicating that these elements are basically not affected by diagenesis, and the resulting isotope data are reliable
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. Previous research
 <sup>e.g.</sup>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup> shows that oxygen isotopes may have undergone strong diagenesis when the sample δ
 <sup>18</sup>O &lt; −10‰. However, carbon isotopes are less susceptible to diagenesis than oxygen isotopes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup> and in some cases where the formation of a diagenetic change occurs, the original δ
 <sup>13</sup>C may still be well preserved
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, in current research, sometimes a δ
 <sup>13</sup>C value can also be valid when δ
 <sup>18</sup>O &lt; −10‰

 </sup>. The Ti/Al ratio is a useful indicator in discrimination of source area differences and has been applied to rocks spanning from the Precambrian through to the Cenozoic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. In this study, the value of most Ti/Al ratios is 0.4–0.6 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>) except for a few abnormal data, and the relatively stable Ti/Al ratio suggests an unchanging source area for the sediments comprising the Sunjiagou and Liujiagou formations.
