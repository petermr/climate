<p id="Par29">Two medium sandstone samples from the Sunjiagou Formation (sample 2015BDSJG-1, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>) and the Liujiagou Formation (sample 2015BDLJG-1, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>) were collected for zircon U-Pb dating so as to constrain the depositional age. We separated zircon grains by conventional heavy liquid and magnetic techniques at the Special Laboratory of the Geological Team of Hebei Province, Langfang, China. In order to investigate the origin and structure of zircon, and select the target for U-Pb analysis, we obtained cathodoluminescence (CL) and reflected- and transmitted-light images. We generated CL images using a HITACHI S-3000 N scanning electron microscope fitted with a Gatan Chroma cathodoluminescence imaging system at the Institute of Geology, CAGS, Beijing, China. We undertook zircon U-Pb analyses using a laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS) at the Institute of Mineral Resources, CAGS, Beijing, China. For each sandstone sample, we randomly selected 90 or 100 zircon grains for analysis, leaving out zircon grains with cracks or inclusions. We carried out laser sampling in an ESI NWR 193 nm laser ablation system, and acquired ion-signal intensisities with an AnlyitikJena PQMS Elite ICP-MS instrument. The analysis beam was ~25 μm in diameter, with 10 Hz repetition rate, and 4 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup> of energy. The analytical procedures followed Hou

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>. The errors for individual analyses are quoted at 1σ level, whereas the errors for weighted mean ages are quoted at 2σ (95% confidence level). For zircons younger than 1000 Ma, 
 <sup>206</sup>Pb/
 <sup>238</sup>U ages are used, but for zircons older than 1000 Ma, 
 <sup>207</sup>Pb/
 <sup>206</sup>Pb ages are used. 
 <sup>206</sup>Pb/
 <sup>238</sup>U ages &gt;10%, &gt;20% discordance or &gt;5% reverse discordance are omitted from further consideration.
