 </sup>, each sample was collected at least ~50 cm below the section surface. Carbonate samples were converted to CO
 <sub>2</sub> using dehydrated phosphoric acid under vacuum at 70 °C for 1 hour. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios were measured by a MAT-253 mass spectrometer at the National Research Center for Geoanalysis, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing. Isotope values were normalized to in-house standards by calibration against NBS-19 carbonate reference material. The measurement precision was &lt; 0.1‰ in general and checked by NBS-19 (δ
 <sup>18</sup>O = −2.20‰, δ
 <sup>13</sup>C = + 1.95‰, PDB standard) and NBS-18 (δ
 <sup>18</sup>O = −23.2‰, δ
 <sup>13</sup>C = −5.1‰, PDB standard). All isotope ratios are given in ‰ relative to PDB. Carbon- and oxygen-isotope results are shown in Supplementary Table
