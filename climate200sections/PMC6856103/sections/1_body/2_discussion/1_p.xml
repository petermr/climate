<p id="Par16">Palaeontological and geochemical evidence demonstrate that the PTB in the Shanxi red beds is at a horizon about 15 m below the top of Sunjiagou Formation (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and the detrital zicon ages from the Sunjiagou and Liujiagou formations support this scenario (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). The synchronous dramatic negative excursion in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C and δ
 <sup>18</sup>O in the uppermost Sunjiagou Formation provide reliable evidence for reduced weathering, coolness, aridification, and anoxia

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Increasingly high negative values of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C and δ
 <sup>18</sup>O in the latest Permian in North China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) reveal the intensified coolness and aridity at that time. In particular, their remarkable shift indicates multiple rapid fluctuations of palaeoclimate, and the sharp negative excursion of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C in bed 51 of the Baode Section was coeval with the last occurrence of bioturbation before the end of the Permian. The sharp negative isotopic excursions were probably a result of dramatic climate perturbations on land and a decrease in vegetation density, which was a response to the ongoing cooling and aridification

 <sup>13</sup>C and δ
 <sup>18</sup>O around the terrestrial PTB were also confirmed in the Karoo Basin in South Africa

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Moreover, the strong positive excursion of Sc/Zr and Lu/Hf also supports an abrupt arid palaeoclimate change
