<p id="Par21">It is reasonable to assume that the switch in fluvial style is largely linked to global climatic change when we combine the simultaneous environmental changes (e.g. arid, cool, and anoxic conditions) and mass extinction across the PTB. The abrupt environmental shocks (e.g. hypoxia, aridity, acid rain and wasting, etc.) were probably the main causes of the PTME on land

 </sup>. The increasingly dry and deteriorating ecological environment resulting from warming and acid rain caused nearly worldwide mass wasting. The remarkable change in fluvial pattern at the PTB in Shanxi confirms results found earlier in Russia

 </sup>, and coincides with the increasingly arid palaeoenvironment throughout the terrestrial PTB in North China. In particular, the well-preserved aeolian deposits in the Liujiagou Formation are a critical sedimentological marker of aridity, highly-erodible land surfaces possibly related to reduced vegetation cover and sufficient wind energy to entrain and transport sediment. Elevated aeolian activity has been noted also in the Lower Triassic of the western German Basin
