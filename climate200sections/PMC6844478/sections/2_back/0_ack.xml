 <p>We are grateful to the numerous industry members, state Government staff and volunteers that have assisted with collecting biological and fisheries data over the years. In particular we would like to thank Peter Hawthorne, Andrew Hogg and Doug Graske for their efforts collecting catch sampling data and Kylie Odgers (South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI)) for her assistance with entering catch and effort information relevant to the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery. We also thank Jonathan Carroll (SARDI) for advice relating to R statistical procedures, and Ana Redondo Rodriguez (SARDI) for her assistance with downloading sea-surface temperature data that was sourced from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) (
