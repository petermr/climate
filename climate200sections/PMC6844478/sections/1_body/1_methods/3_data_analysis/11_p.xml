<p>Examination of AICc values from the first set of GLMs indicated equal support (Î”AICc &lt;2) from the two top models: 1) L
 <sub>50</sub> ~ Region + Region*CPUE; and 2) L
 <sub>50</sub> ~ Region*sea-surface temperature + Region*CPUE. Even though depth was not a significant predictor in these GLMs, we considered depth an important variable to account for because of strong evidence for its influence on size at maturity (L
 <sub>50</sub>), abundance (CPUE) and sea-surface temperature [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Results</xref>). Moreover, movement of fishing operations inshore over time (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Results</xref>) necessitated the need to reduce any potential confounding effect of depth on sea-surface temperature, CPUE, and size at maturity (L
 <sub>50</sub>) responses. Consequently, a second set of GLMs was developed, removing depth as a factor and using data restricted to lobsters sampled from depth contours between 20-30m. AICc was again used to select a final best model from a set of 32 candidate models developed
