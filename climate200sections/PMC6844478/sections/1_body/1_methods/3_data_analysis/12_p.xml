<p>Collinearity diagnostics (Variance Inflation Factors [VIF]) obtained through regression analysis in SPSS (v24) were used to examine the presence of co-linearity between and among predictor variables in GLMs. Collinearity between all variables was negligible (all VIF less than three). Significance of best-fit model terms were tested using Wald Chi-square statistics and the percent change in deviance between the final model and null model was calculated as a measure of the amount of variation explained by the best-fit model [
