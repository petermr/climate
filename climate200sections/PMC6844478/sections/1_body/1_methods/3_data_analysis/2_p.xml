<p>A total of 372,109 female lobsters were measured, sexed and assessed for reproductive state in the voluntary catch sampling program between 1991 and 2015. Of these, 352,985 had sufficient information recorded to enable size at maturity analyses. Analyses of fishery data indicated movement of fishing operations to shallower inshore fishing grounds across all areas of the fishery since 1991 (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Results</xref>) so we undertook size at maturity estimation procedures in each region twice, once using the complete data set and again using data recorded from Southern Rock Lobster caught at 20–30m depth only (
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Preliminary analyses indicated that this depth range was the most commonly fished in each region thereby providing the largest sample sizes for size at maturity analyses for each combination of region and year. Size at maturity was estimable for nearly all combinations of region (1–5) and year between 1991 and 2015. The exception to this was in region 1, where size at maturity was inestimable for some years (
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) due to low numbers of female Southern Rock Lobster sometimes measured in this region, which is indicative of the relatively low catch and observer effort in this part of the fishery.
