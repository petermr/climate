<p>We analysed trends in size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster since 1991 for lobsters caught at the 20–30m depth contour as well as for lobsters caught from all depth contours. For each region (1–5), we then tested the null hypothesis of no temporal change in size at maturity (i.e. slope = 0) occurring since 1991 using linear regression with ANOVA in OriginPro® (p&lt;0.05), with year as the dependent variable.</p>
