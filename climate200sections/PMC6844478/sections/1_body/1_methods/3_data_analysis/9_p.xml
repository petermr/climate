<p>Mean daily bottom temperature was calculated in region 3 and region 5 for all bottom data available from October to May between 1998 and 2015. Weather constraints resulted in bottom temperature data being unavailable for some months in the two regions where loggers were located. To enable analyses of inter-annual trends in bottom temperature, data were restricted to the summer months of December, January and February. In region 3, data were available from all summer months between 2008 and 2017. In region 5, available data were aggregated for all summer months sampled at Southend between 1998–2002, 2006–2012 and 2014–2015; Port McDonnell between 1998–1999, and 2002–2003; and from Robe between 1998–2001, 2006, 2009 and 2010. In each region, a significant increase or decrease in summer bottom temperatures over time was tested for using linear regression with ANOVA in OriginPro® (p&lt;0.05), with year as the dependent variable. We also estimated summer-specific temperature anomalies for available data in region 3 between 2008 and 2016, and for region 5 between 1998 and 2015.</p>
