<p>We used a first set of generalised linear models (GLM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in SPSS (v24) to examine the effect of region, depth, sea-surface temperature, and relative abundance (CPUE) on estimates of size at maturity (L
 <sub>50</sub>) measured for all Southern Rock Lobster sampled between 1992 and 2015. Growth of Southern Rock Lobster to legal size in South Australia is reached in approximately four years [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and we considered that growth during this time would incorporate the environmental conditions experienced by lobsters as they attained maturity. Consequently, for each region, we applied four-year average estimates of sea-surface temperature to yearly size at maturity (L
 <sub>50</sub>) estimates in the GLMs. Akaike’s information criterion, corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), was used to select the best models from a set of 35 candidate models developed 
 <italic>a priori</italic>. AIC is useful as to compare candidate models derived from the same dataset and AICc provides for sample correction and greater penalty for each parameter. Models with smaller AICc values are preferred and models with changes in AICc (ΔAICc) greater than two have less support [
