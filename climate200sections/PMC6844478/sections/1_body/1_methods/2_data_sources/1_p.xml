<p>Data in the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery are collected in each management zone through two data collection programs; 1) a commercial logbook program; and 2) a voluntary catch sampling program. Mandatory reporting of data through the commercial logbook program was implemented in 1970 as a requirement of fishing licence conditions. The logbook records data relating to fishing activities, including Marine Fishing Area, weight of Southern Rock Lobster catch, number of legal-size Southern Rock Lobster landed, and fishing effort as potlifts. The voluntary catch sampling program was implemented in 1991. Fishers and on-board observers voluntarily record information relating to the size (carapace length (mm, CL), sex, sexual maturity of female lobsters, as well as the date, depth and location of capture. Female lobsters are classified as sexually mature based on the presence of eggs or existence of ovigerous (long) setae on the endopodite of the pleopods [

Between 1991 and 2015, fishers and on-board observers participating in the voluntary catch sampling program recorded data from a total of 729,567 lobsters. In this study, all fishery data are collected from a fishing season that occurs between October and May and we refer to year as the year in which each fishing season began (e.g. October 1999 to May 2000 = 1999). No permits are required to record data from fish or crustacean species targeted and landed by commercial fishing operations in South Australia.
