<p>The study area encompasses waters targeted for fishing of Southern Rock Lobster by the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery. The fishery is split into two management zones, the Southern Zone and Northern Zone, and each zone is subdivided into Marine Fishing Areas for reporting and management purposes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To analyse spatial and temporal trends in size at maturity, and the factors potentially influencing size at maturity, all data were assigned to 1 of 5 spatial regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The spatial boundaries of the five regions were chosen to capture differences in the oceanographic features across the study area, including meridional changes, which influence sea-surface temperature [
