<p>Local oceanographic conditions across the study area reflect differences in the nature of interactions between bathymetry and seasonal changes in atmospheric forcing [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. During summer, prevailing south-easterly winds across the study area cause large-scale coastal upwelling events that vary in their intensity and duration depending on the orientation and bathymetric characteristics of the continental shelf [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The relatively narrow shelf and steep bathymetry at the southern tip of Eyre Peninsula in the eastern Great Australian Bight and off south-western Kangaroo Island (region 3), and the Bonney Coast (region 5), supports two to four upwelling events per summer, each occurring for over one week’s duration [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], with surface SST responses most evident on the Bonney Coast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These events pull cold water (&lt;15°C) onto the shelf within 10km of the coast [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In region 3, cooler (&lt;15°C), nutrient rich waters are upwelled from depths below 200m onto the shelf and reside in the bottom layer referred to as the Kangaroo Island cold pool [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The influence of upwelling diminishes to the west of region 3 across the Great Australian Bight, with upwelling events becoming shorter and restricted to near-shore areas of the coast as far west as Anxious Bay (region 1) [
