 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and summer warming of shallower shelf waters results in the establishment of a deep warm isothermal layer, known as the Great Australian Bight warm pool, with near uniform temperatures &gt;17°C observed to depths greater than 40 m [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Similarly, Region 4 is characterised by a broad and shallow shelf area. Here, inshore waters are characterised by reduced wave energy and river discharge from Australia’s largest river system, the River Murray, while offshore waters are downstream from Bonney Coast upwelling events. These summer differences in oceanography between regions 1–5 are thought to influence the ontogenetic characteristics of Southern Rock Lobster populations in different parts of the South Australian fishery [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, winter oceanographic processes across South Australia are characterised by an increase in the intensity of Leeuwin current that transports warmer water from Western Australia east along the continental shelf, with connectivity extending to the east of Kangaroo Island in July [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Seasonal cooling and prevailing westerly winds, also drive coastal currents eastward [
