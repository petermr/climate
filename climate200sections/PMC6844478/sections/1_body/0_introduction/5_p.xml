<p>The intrinsic link between temperature, growth, size at maturity, and resulting egg production and recruitment in crustacean populations highlights the need for fishery resource managers to consider how fishery population traits might respond to changes in environmental conditions. This study uses data provided through long-term stock assessment monitoring in the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery to measure temporal and spatial patterns of size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster since 1991. We examine spatial and temporal patterns in size at maturity in relation to the known oceanographic characteristics in each part of the fishery, as well as surface and subsurface temperature data collected from satellites and ocean sensors. As density-dependent processes can also influence patterns in size at maturity, we also assess the effect of any relative changes in Southern Rock Lobster abundance on the patterns in size at maturity observed. Implications for stock assessment and management of the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery are considered in relation to the patterns in size at maturity across South Australia and the current minimum legal size limits used to manage the fishery.</p>
