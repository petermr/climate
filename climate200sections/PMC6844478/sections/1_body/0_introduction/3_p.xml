<p>Recruitment of Southern Rock Lobster has declined across the speciesâ€™ distribution in southern Australia, resulting in declines in fishery performance in all jurisdictions where lobster are targeted [

Total catches in each state are currently some of the lowest on record, and recent assessments indicate that combined levels of egg production are approaching the limit reference point of 20% unfished egg production used in national assessment of the stock [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The broad spatial-scale over which the declines in recruitment have been recorded signal the occurrence of a regime shift associated with a change in environmental conditions, rather than the effects of fishing-related mortality alone [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Tasmania, hind-cast stock assessment modelling identified a negative relationship between larval settlement, model-estimated recruitment and sea-surface temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the study noted considerable variation in the relationship between different regions of the fishery, and highlighted the need for studies to examine biophysical relationships at spatial scales relevant to existing local oceanographic processes.
