<p>Crustacean sensitivity to changes in their local thermal environment is well recognised (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), yet the impacts of increasing ocean temperatures associated with climate change on populations traits are not yet well documented. For lobsters, increases in water temperature can accelerate growth and development, yet the nature of the relationship between size at maturity and temperature is not consistent among species [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, in Western Rock Lobster (
 <italic>Panulirus cygnus</italic>) and American Lobster (
 <italic>Homarus americanus</italic>), size at maturity is inversely related to the temperature conditions experienced during growth [

Such divergent responses among species are thought to reflect species-specific adaptations in physiology that mediate the way temperature influences the partitioning of energy resources to processes of somatic growth and reproductive development [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Increases in temperature can either act to accelerate the intermoult period (moult frequency), increase the amount of growth per moult (moult increment), or both [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Consequently, where size at maturity is dependent on the number of moults (instars) before maturity is reached, reductions in size at maturity may be observed in response to higher temperature. Where size at maturity is independent of moult frequency, increases in size at maturity may occur in response to higher temperatures. In Southern Rock Lobster and other 
 <italic>Jasus</italic> species, size at maturity is considered to be age dependent [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and therefore independent of moult frequency. As a result, increases in water temperature lead to larger size at maturity as growth rates increase [
