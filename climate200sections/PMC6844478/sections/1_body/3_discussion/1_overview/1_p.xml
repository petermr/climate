<p>Fisheries are subject to a variety of regulatory controls that are designed to manage the fraction of mature biomass that is harvested, thereby maintaining rates of egg production and larval settlement at a level where recruitment is not impaired. Where minimum legal size limits are applied, and informed by measures of size at maturity (L
 <sub>50</sub>), an understanding of how size at maturity varies both temporally and spatially is crucial to ensuring that management objectives are meeting their intent. There is a general paucity of information relating to long-term spatio-temporal responses in size at maturity in spiny lobster populations. Southern Rock Lobster are a good species to examine spatio-temporal size at maturity responses to habitat conditions, because they exhibit limited movement in their benthic life history phase [

Our study was fortuitous in having available a long time series of biological data collected from a Southern Rock Lobster stock assessment monitoring program originating in 1991, and highlights spatial heterogeneity in size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster over an area spanning approximately 229,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> as well as temporal differences in size at maturity occurring over 25 years.
