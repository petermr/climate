 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] have highlighted that when nominal catch rates are standardised for factors such as year, month, depth, MFA, mean weight, licence and consumer price index (CPI), both nominal and standardised time series are closely aligned. However, it is important to highlight that while no difference was observed between the approaches, the standardisation did not include some factors known to have important effects on lobster catch rate in other lobster fisheries within south-eastern Australia. Specifically, data pertaining to the effects of ‘vessel’ were not available as part of the South Australian analyses. This component has been identified as a specific factor known to impact on lobster catch rates within the Southern Rock Lobster fishery of Victoria, Australia [
