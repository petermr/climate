<p>The limitations associated with the use of fishery-dependent data should also be noted. For example, catch composition can be affected by changes in fishing behaviour. Previous research in the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery, identified a negative relationship between estimates of growth, size at maturity and depth [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] so our study assessed the need to account for changes in the depth of fishing over time. The recorded movement of fishing operations to shallower inshore fishing grounds across all areas of the fishery since 1991 can be attributed to changes in market demand, where inshore lobsters that are ‘red’ in colour and of relatively higher value became favoured over ‘speckled’ or ‘white’ lobsters typically found in offshore grounds [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our study accounted for any biases in size at maturity estimates associated with these changes in fishing behaviour by restricting analyses to Southern Rock Lobster caught at 20–30m depth. The influence of fishing gear type on the size of lobsters sampled should also be acknowledged. Within South Australia, lobsters &lt;70 and &gt;210 mm CL are rarely landed by commercial fishing pots, which is consistent with the size selectivity of trap-caught spiny lobsters in other fisheries [
