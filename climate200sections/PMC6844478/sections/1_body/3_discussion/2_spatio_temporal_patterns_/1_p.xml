<p>Higher annual estimates of size at maturity were recorded in the north-western areas of the fishery (region 1) relative to the south-east (region 5). This latitudinal pattern is similar to the north-south decline in estimates of size at maturity described for Southern Rock Lobster in Tasmania [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The latitudinal pattern in estimates of size at maturity observed in our study is also spatially consistent with growth rate estimates of Southern Rock Lobster recorded over the same area [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where relatively higher growth rates of mature females were identified in the north western and western parts of the fishery (regions 1 and 2 â€“this study) compared to south-eastern localities (region 5).
