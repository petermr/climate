<p>Linear regressions of size at maturity measured between 1991 and 2015 in regions 1, 2, 3 indicated significant departures from the null hypothesis of zero slope (trend) for lobsters caught at the 20–30m depth contour as well as for lobsters caught from all depth contours. Size at maturity of lobsters also increased significantly in region 5 for lobsters caught at the 20–30m depth contour. However, the nature (slope) of the temporal responses in size at maturity recorded in each region since 1991 differed. The increasing temporal trend in size at maturity in regions 1, 2 and 5, and historically high annual estimates of size at maturity calculated in these regions since 2000 indicate that the current minimum legal size limits in these regions may not be providing the same amount of protection to egg production and Southern Rock Lobster biomass compared to what they have historically. Conversely, the steady decreases in size at maturity in region 3 since 1991 indicates that the current minimum legal size limit in this region may be providing a higher degree of protection to egg production and biomass than it was in 2000. As indicated in egg-per-recruit modelling for female American lobster [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], egg production tends to increase as size at maturity declines because of a higher chance of spawning prior to landing, but this relationship is ultimately dependent on the intensity of harvesting (harvest fraction) and strength of size-based selection in the fishery. In light of the changes in size at maturity measured in our study throughout different parts of the South Australia Rock Lobster Fishery, spatially resolved egg-per recruit modelling that considers the temporal trends in size at maturity presented herein would be a logical next step for stock assessment research in South Australia and should be considered more broadly as a priority for national assessment that considers 20% unfished egg production as a limit reference point [
