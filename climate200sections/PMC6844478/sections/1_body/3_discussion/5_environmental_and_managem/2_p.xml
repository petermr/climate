<p>The impacts of ocean warming via climate change are now manifested in changes in the distribution, abundance and reproductive phenology of fish stocks [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The relatively high rates of increase of sea-surface temperature and size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster recorded in our study from the well mixed waters of regions 1 and 2 since 1991, indicate that the growth rates of lobsters in these regions may also be increasing in response to ocean warming associated with global climate change. Changes in size at maturity and bottom temperature in region 3 since 2008 and region 5 since 1998 also indicate that the growth rates of Southern Rock Lobster are responding to variations in the oceanographic processes in these regions.
