<p>The physical oceanographic characteristics of shelf waters between the eastern Great Australian Bight and the Bonney Coast in south-eastern South Australia are only recently documented [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The continental shelf of the eastern Great Australian Bight is broad and relatively shallow resulting in summer warming of shelf waters [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in regions 1 and 2. The presence of this vertically well-mixed warm pool of water [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in regions 1 and 2 indicates that the increasing trends in sea-surface temperature recorded since 1991 may be good proxies for the trends in bottom temperature in these regions, and be driving the increases in size at maturity observed.
