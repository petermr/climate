<p>In contrast, the relatively narrow shelf and steep bathymetry of southern Eyre Peninsula and south-western Kangaroo Island (region 3), and the Bonney Coast (region 5) support two to four near-shore upwelling events per summer [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The variable strength and intensity of upwelling in these regions makes the potential relationship between sea-surface and bottom temperature less clear. For example, in region 3, the positive trend in sea-surface temperature measured since 1991 contrasts with the negative trend in bottom temperature collected from 100m since 2008. In this region, upwelled water is drawn onto shelf waters shallower than 100m during summer, with evidence of the existence of a bottom cold pool occurring below a warm surface layer near the mouth of Spencer Gulf, &lt;10 km from the coast in waters of approximately 30m depth [
