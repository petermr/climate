<p>Residual plots and AICc values indicated that the most suitable GLMs to model the effects of region, sea-surface temperature, CPUE and their interactions on size at maturity incorporated a Gamma error structure and log link function. The Gamma distribution captured the strong right positive skew of annual L
 <sub>50</sub> estimates in each region. The top candidate sets of models including the ‘null’ model, are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Values of AICc indicated that the most well supported model included region, CPUE and a region*sea-surface temperature interaction. This model explained 63.8% of the deviance from the null model (100*[0.458 – 0.166]/0.458) (
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Wald Chi-square tests indicated that all model terms were significant (Wald Chi-square = 7.5–16.9, all p &lt; 0.05) demonstrating that L
 <sub>50</sub> is strongly region specific, and best explained by both CPUE and the interaction between region and sea-surface temperature. Examination of GLM parameter estimates and Wald Chi-square statistics for individual parameters of the most well supported model indicated a significant negative relationship between L
 <sub>50</sub> and CPUE (β = -0.043, Standardised beta = -0.001, Wald Chi-square = 7.463, p = 0.006). Significant negative relationships between L
 <sub>50</sub> and the region*sea-surface temperature interaction in Region 3 (β = -0.054, Standardised beta = -0.001, Wald Chi-square = 4.137, p = 0.042) and Region 4 (β = -0.062, Standardised beta = -0.001, Wald Chi-square = 4.952, p = 0.026) (Appendix 1) were also observed, indicating respective declines in size at maturity of -0.054 and -0.062 mm in these regions for every one degree increase in sea-surface temperature. Conversely, there was a significant positive relationship between L
 <sub>50</sub> and the region*sea-surface temperature interaction in Region 5 (β = 0.049, Standardised beta = 0.001, Wald Chi-square = 3.894, p = 0.048) indicating an increase in size at maturity of 0.049 mm in region 5 for every one degree increase in sea-surface temperature (Appendix 1).
