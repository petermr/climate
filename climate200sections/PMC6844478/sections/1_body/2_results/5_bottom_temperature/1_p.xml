<p>The temporal scales at which bottom temperature data were collected in region 3 (2008–2016) and region 5 (1998–2016) do not match that measured for mean sea-surface temperature (1992–2015), however, available bottom temperature data in these regions give an indication of the recent trends in temperature that may be influencing patterns of lobster growth and size at maturity. Regression analyses indicated a non-significant decrease in mean summer bottom temperature between 2008 and 2016 in region 3 (ANOVA: F = 1.76, p = 0.226) (

Mean summer estimates of bottom temperature in region 3 from 2013 to 2016 were between 0.10 and 1.34°C below the 2008–2016 average also indicating a decreasing trend in bottom temperature in this region. In region 5, regression analyses indicated a non-significant increase in mean summer bottom temperature between 1998 and 2015 (ANOVA: F = 1.76, p = 0.207) (
