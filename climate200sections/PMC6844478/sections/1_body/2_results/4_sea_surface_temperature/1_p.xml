<p>The north to south spatial variation in estimates of mean sea-surface temperature in each region between 1992 and 2015 reflect the changes in latitude across South Australian shelf waters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In region 1 (31.5–34.0°S), mean estimates of sea-surface temperature measured from the all depth contours and at the 20–30m depth contour over this period were 20.8 ± 0.08°C (range: 20.1–21.7°C) and 20.2 ± 0.09°C (range: 19.5–21.1°C), respectively (

In contrast, in region 5 (37.0–39.0°S), in south-eastern South Australia, the mean estimate of sea-surface temperature between 1992 and 2015 from the all depth contours and at the 20–30m depth contour were 18.5 ± 0.10°C (range: 17.5–19.5°C) and 17.7 ± 0.13°C (range: 16.7–19.2°C), respectively (
