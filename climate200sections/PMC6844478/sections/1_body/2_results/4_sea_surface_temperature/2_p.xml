<p>Estimates of mean annual sea-surface temperature measured from all depth contours generally increased in each region across South Australia since 1992 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5A–5E</xref>). Regression analyses indicated significant increases in average sea-surface temperature in regions 1, 2, 3, and 5 since 1992 (ANOVA results, F = 5.48–6.84, all p≤0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5A, 5B, 5C and 5E</xref>). Average sea-surface temperature increased in these four regions at a rate ranging between 0.02 ±0.01 
 <sup>o</sup>C.year
 <sup>-1</sup> in region 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) to 0.03 ±0.01 
 <sup>o</sup>C.year
 <sup>-1</sup> in region 5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). No significant trend in sea-surface temperature was observed in region 4 between 1991 and 2015 (ANOVA, F = 3.53, p = 0.074) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similar increasing trends in average sea-surface temperature were measured at the 20–30m depth contour in regions 1, 2, 3, and 5 since 1992 (ANOVA, F = 5.03–6.46, all p≤0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g005">Fig 5A–5E</xref>), however average sea-surface temperatures in each region measured at 20–30m were relatively lower in all years when compared to average sea-surface temperature measured from all depth contours (
