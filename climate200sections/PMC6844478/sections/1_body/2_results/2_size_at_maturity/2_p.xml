<p>The temporal trends in size at maturity of lobsters caught at the 20–30m depth contour resembled those measured from all depth contours in each region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3A–3E</xref>). Since 1991, significant increases in size at maturity were recorded from Southern Rock Lobster caught at the 20–30m depth contour in regions 1, 2 and 5 (ANOVA: region 1, F = 10.23, p = 0.008; region 2, F = 51.84, p&lt;0.001; region 5, F = 9.21, p = 0.006) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3E</xref>). Of these regions, the highest rate of increase in size at maturity also occurred in region 1 at 0.50±0.16 mm CL per year. In region 2, size at maturity increased at a rate of 0.42±0.06 mm CL per year and in region 5, the rate of increase in size at maturity was relatively slower at 0.21±0.07 mm CL per year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3A and 3E</xref>). No significant trend in size at maturity was measured in region 4 since 1991 (ANOVA: F = 3.00, p = 0.097). In region 3, similar to the trends in size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster measured at all depth contours, size at maturity decreased significantly at a rate of 0.15 ±0.07 mm per year (ANOVA: F = 4.78, p = 0.039) (
