<p>Significant increases in size at maturity were recorded for Southern Rock Lobster sampled from all depth contours in regions 1 and 2 since 1991 (ANOVA: region 1, F = 9.0, p = 0.007; region 2, F = 38.7, p&lt;0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The highest rate of increase in size at maturity occurred in region 1 at 0.39±0.13 mm CL per year. In region 2, size at maturity increased at a rate of 0.32±0.06 mm CL per year. No significant changes in size at maturity were measured from lobsters sampled from all depth contours in regions 4 or 5 since 1991 (ANOVA: region 4, F = 1.13, p = 0.030; region 5, F = 0.26, p = 0.61). In contrast, size at maturity decreased significantly in region 3 at a rate of 0.22 ±0.06 mm per year (ANOVA: F = 15.4, p&lt;0.001) (
