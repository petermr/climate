 <caption> Temporal trends in the size at maturity of female Southern Rock Lobster caught from all depth contours and at the 20-30m depth contour in regions 1–5 (a-e, respectively) between 1991 and 2015. Annual averages are presented ± 95% CI. Minimum Legal Size (MLS) limits applicable to each region are shown by dotted line. Region 4 does not show MLS as it incorporates both the Northern Zone and Southern Zone management units, with different MLS limits. Box and whisker plot (f) showing variations in size at maturity (L 50) from all depth contours and at the 20-30m depth contour in regions 1–5. Confidence Limits: box limits = 25th and 75th percentiles, whisker limits = 5th and 95th percentiles. </caption>
