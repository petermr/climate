<p>Our results imply that climate change will have a sizable impact on the number of cases of LD in the United States in the coming decades. Using the estimated impacts of temperature on the incidence of the disease in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, column 3, and the distribution of county-year observations in each bin of annual average temperature from 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we have predicted an increase of 8.6 cases of LD per 100,000 population per county-year, an increase of about 21 percent relative to the average incidence of the disease over the period 2000–2016. This was done by assuming a 2°C increase in annual average temperature in the northern area of the United States by mid-century (2036–2065). (The 2°C increase in annual average temperature implies that the share of counties in one 2°C bin in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> would show up in the following 2°C bin. For example, the 26 percent of counties in the 7–9°C temperature bin in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> would show up in the 9–11°C bin. The calculation of the impact of that increase in annual average temperature then used the estimates reported in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, column 3, and the shift up of the shares presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.) This temperature increase is assumed to be an approximation for the change the region we focus on might experience in the future. In fact, it is slightly below the mid-century (2036–2065) projections for the Northeast (2.21°C or 3.98°F) and Midwest (2.34°C or 4.21°F) from the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) (USGCRP 2017). This is under the more conservative Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, which assumes global annual greenhouse gas emissions peaking around 2040, then declining. Under the RCP 8.5, which assumes that emissions will continue to rise throughout the twenty-first century, those mid-century (2036–2065) predicted increases in annual average temperature would be 2.83°C (5.09°F) for the Northeast and 2.94°C (5.29°F) for the Midwest (see definition of the NCA4 regions at
