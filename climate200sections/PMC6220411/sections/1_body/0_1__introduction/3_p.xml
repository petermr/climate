<p>If not treated, LD progresses through three stages. The first stage—early localized disease—manifests by erythema migrans, which is an erythematous macule or papule that occurs one to two weeks following the tick bite and subsequently enlarges [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This rash can be uniformly erythematous or might have central clearing (“bull's eye”) with a median diameter around 15 cm [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Left untreated, 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> disseminates from the site of the bite, and the disease progresses to the early disseminated stage. In this stage, which occurs three to five weeks following the initial bite, multiple (secondary) erythema migrans occur. These lesions tend to be similar to the primary erythema migrans but are usually smaller [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cardiac and neurologic manifestations are also seen in the early disseminated stage, with atrioventricular heart block being the most common cardiac manifestation. Peripheral nerve palsy (particularly facial nerve) and meningitis are the most common neurological manifestations of this stage of LD. In the United States, the most common manifestation of the late disseminated stage of LD is Lyme arthritis [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lyme arthritis is usually mono or oligoarticular, affects large joints (knee, most commonly), and occurs weeks to months after the bite. Unlike in Europe, neurological manifestations of late LD are rare in the United States [
