<p>We accept that generating a net water gain from rainfall enhancement is a big “ask,” and we are careful not to make such claims. Indeed, we use the term “significantly reduce irrigation water demand” within the paper (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Even so, rainfall quantities are significant, and even a moderate offsetting of irrigation is valuable. But this is “academic” to a certain extent, because to assess potential based solely on water balances is to oversimplify the system. Rain enhancement is only one potential of plantation systems, and the following factors [as given in the publication (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)] must also be included: carbon storage and carbon trading; viability as a negative emission technology; irrigation offsetting; valuable oils and bioenergy; growth of dryland economies; and soil protection, flushing, and reversal of desertification.
