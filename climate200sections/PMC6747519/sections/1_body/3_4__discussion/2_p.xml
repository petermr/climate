<p>When used in isolation, the two precipitation-related variables of MAP and PAS were also important. The response curves showed that camphor tree had greater requirements for annual precipitation and was suitable for growing in areas with abundant rainfall. At the same time, areas with snowfall were extremely unsuitable for camphor growth. Some scholars have reported that factors such as soil moisture and soil nutrients, which were affected by precipitation, play an important role in tree growth [

However, compared with the relative variables contribution rates of niche models, MAP and PAS did not show a significant influence, indicating that the growth of camphor trees is more dependent on temperature variables. In the subtropical climate regions of southeastern China, the accumulated temperature is high and the precipitation is also abundant, making it an excellent habitat for camphor tree. However, under the trend of temperature rising, by the end of this century, the global temperature is expected to rise between 1.4 and 5.0 Â°C [
