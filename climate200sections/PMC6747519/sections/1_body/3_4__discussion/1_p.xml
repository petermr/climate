<p>In this study, the ecological niche model was established using MaxEnt method to predict potential distribution areas of camphor tree on a national scale, and the model was considered to be reliable. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03185-f004">Figure 4</xref> depicts that 58 of the 62 sample points were distributed in the high-adaptive region, 2 in the middle-adaptive region and 2 in the low-adaptive region, respectively, and no distribution point was found in the non-adaptive region, showing that the predicted results were credible. We also found that among the temperature-related variables, DD &lt; 0 was the most important contributor to the prediction of the suitable areas, which may be due to the fact that the accumulated temperature in cold months can seriously freeze the roots by lowering the soil temperature [

The results of the jackknife test of variable importance showed that EXT was very important in the simulation of camphor tree niche, indicating that extreme high temperature may have a serious inhibitory effect on the growth process. For example, the extreme high temperature increases breathing, reduces stomatal conductance, thereby reducing the need for higher transpiration, and to some extent directly reducing photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our research showed that the average temperature of the most suitable growth areas of camphor tree is 16.5–29 °C, indicating sufficient heat accumulation is essential for the camphor growth.
