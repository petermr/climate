<p>Long-term climate change affects the regeneration and migration of ecosystem species, while short-term biological changes in local areas are dominated by non-climatic factors [

In the camphor tree afforestation activities, the highly suitable areas predicted by the model can be prioritized to achieve efficient use of resources. The emerging potential habitats in the northwestern part of Xinjiang are far apart and species migration is difficult. According to the species energy hypothesis, the cold regions that have experienced warming and the arid regions that have experienced increased water supply are expected to exhibit increased species richness [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, we can also use them as choices for future afforestation areas. For existing plantations in the suitable areas, more attentions should be paid to management and protection. For example, the camphor tree is susceptible to pests, and climate warming increases the severity and frequency of pests and diseases [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Besides, parts of the current suitable areas may become unsuitable in the future, and the climatic conditions of the areas will not be conducive to the growth and development of this species. We should promptly formulate a reasonable contingency plan to help this species migrate to new suitable areas. Therefore, it is important to understand as much as possible the response of this species to climate fluctuations, and combine the niche model with the physiological characteristics to classify the suitable areas more scientifically.
