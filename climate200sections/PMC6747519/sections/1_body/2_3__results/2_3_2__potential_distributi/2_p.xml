<p>Comparing the two scenarios, we found that under the RCP8.5 condition, the area of suitable range would increase faster at high latitudes, but the area of suitable range at lower latitudes would reduce more (

However, under the RCP4.5 scenario, the growth of the area of suitable habitat would gradually slow down, and would increase by only 4.7% from 2055s to 2085s. At the end of the century, under the RCP4.5 scenario, the area of suitable range would increase by 84.8% compared with the present, while the RCP8.5 scenario would increase by 1.3 times compared with the same period of the previous year. The predicted area of suitable range would account for 18.3% of land area in China.
