<p>The ecological niche model predicted that climate warming would promote the expansion of the potential suitable habitats of camphor tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03185-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In the current climate, highly suitable areas were concentrated in most areas south of the Yangtze River, accounting for 7.9% of land area in China. The prediction results were consistent with the survey records [

This study found that with the warming of the climate, the geographical distribution of high potential areas changed under the two scenarios, and the area of distribution range generally showed an increasing trend and gradually expanded to the high latitudes. Through horizontal observation, the predicted maps showed that Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing and Hubei would have a rise of probability presence. Longitudinal observation also showed that the range of suitable areas in Henan and Shandong would expand. Meanwhile, we found that there would be a significant reduction in the area of suitable habitats in Hainan, Guangdong and Guangxi coastal areas. In addition, it was predicted that by the end of this century, new suitable areas would appear in the northwestern part of Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
