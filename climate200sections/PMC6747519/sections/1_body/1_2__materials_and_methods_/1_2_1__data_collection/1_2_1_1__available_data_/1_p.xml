<p>In this study, we collected two types of data for modeling: one for the geographical location of camphor trees, which was used to describe the distribution of the species, and the other for climate data of the distribution areas, which described the climatic conditions of the habitats. Through field investigation, literature inquiry, and network resource search (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.cvh.ac.cn" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cvh.ac.cn</uri>), we obtained 181 geographical distribution data of this species in China. This part of the data might show the autocorrelation in spatial distribution [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To alleviate this problem, we filtered the data at the spatial level. Specifically, we first meshed the study area, each grid with an area of 4 km × 4 km, with only a single distribution point selected in each grid. Furthermore, we required that the distribution points be at least 10 kilometers apart. The goal was to meet the terrain and environmental heterogeneity requirements of the model without excessively reducing the number of distribution points [

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03185-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>). Among them, there were 43 field observations and 106 specimen records data. In addition, we collected the distribution data of 62 camphor trees from the global biodiversity information agency (GBIF) (1960–2018s, in China), including observation data and sample data. This part of data would be used to verify the division of suitable regions, and to evaluate the modeling effect.
