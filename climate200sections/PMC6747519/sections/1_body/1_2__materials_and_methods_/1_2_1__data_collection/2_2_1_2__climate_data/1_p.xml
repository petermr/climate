<p>The accuracy of the plant climate response model depends mainly on whether the historical climate data of the plant habitat accurately reflects the actual climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Climate AP is a climate model used to represent the climate of the East Asia Pacific region, providing high-precision, high-resolution historical and future climate data [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It uses the best available climate data as baseline data and converts it to a scale-free format using dynamic local downscaling. It calculates and derives more biologically relevant climate variables that make it more useful in various applications in forest modeling. We used Climate AP to generate national current and future grid climate data with a spatial resolution of approximately 16 km
 <sup>2</sup>, which was used to predict the potential suitable range of camphor tree and its response to climate change. We used two greenhouse gas release scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and selected three future time periods, 2025s, 2055s, and 2085s, to represent the three periods of the early, middle, and final phases of the 21st century. The 16 climate variables in this study (

To avoid cross-correlation within selected environmental variables, we used the Pearson correlation coefficient in the R language (version 3.5.1) for multicollinearity testing and eliminate variables with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03185-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to select significant bioclimatic variables among the remaining variables [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Eventually, eight climate variables were retained for model building: mean annual temperature (MAT), temperature difference between mean warmest month temperature and mean coldest month temperature (TD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), degree days below 0 Â°C (DD &lt; 0), precipitation as snow between August in previous year and July in current year (PAS), extreme minimum temperature over 30 years (EXT), Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit (CMD), and annual heat moisture index (AHM).
