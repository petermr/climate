<p>The MaxEnt method used in this study is based on the niche principle model, which assumes under certain known conditions, the system with the highest entropy is closest to its true state [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Firstly, the constraints are obtained according to the characteristics of the environmental variables of the species existence data, then the distribution probability of the maximum entropy is acquired under the constraint condition, and finally the habitat distribution of different spaces and time is predicted accordingly [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We chose the MaxEnt 3.4.1 software version and selected the following settings before the model runs: Checked the jackknife forecast to assess the importance of the variables in the model; random test = 25%; regularized multiplier = 1; maximum background points = 10,000; replicates = 10; the rest of the settings remained the default parameters. This setup is considered to be reasonable and effective in a wide range of niche studies [
