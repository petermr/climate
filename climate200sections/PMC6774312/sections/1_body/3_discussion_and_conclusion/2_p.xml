<p>Over the recent decades, we have seen a strong increase in land areas that are concurrently affected by warm and hot temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The four largest events in the observational record occurred within the last 12 years, consistent with a strong recent increase in heat wave occurrence (Christidis et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Rowe &amp; Derry, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Seneviratne et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Generally, the large interannual variability of concurrent heat wave occurrence can be driven by different processes. While years with El Niño events are typically associated with warmer temperatures at a global scale (Seneviratne et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), this effect is less relevant for the boreal summers in the NH AgPop region. Furthermore, changes in large‐scale circulation and land‐atmosphere feedbacks could increase the areas concurrently experience warm and hot temperatures. A recent study shows that in 2018 a specific atmospheric pattern connected heat waves in North America, Western Europe, and the Caspian Sea region (Kornhuber et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Additionally, central Europe experienced concurrent dry and hot conditions from spring to summer in 2018 that were exceptional at least within the last 500 years (Toreti et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The dry conditions in central and Northern Europe possibly amplified extreme temperatures in these regions via land‐atmosphere feedbacks.
