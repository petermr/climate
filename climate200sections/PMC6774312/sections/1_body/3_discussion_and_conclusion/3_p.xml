<p>Overall, our results suggest that we have entered a new climate regime in which the occurrence of extraordinary global‐scale heat waves cannot be explained without human‐induced climate change. In particular, the simulations show that a GCWH18‐like event does not occur in historical simulations. The saturation effect of the probability ratio will become more dominant in a warmer climate where unprecedented events will have a probability ratio in the mathematical limit of
