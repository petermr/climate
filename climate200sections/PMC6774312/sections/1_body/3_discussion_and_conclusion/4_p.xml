<p>The importance of global warming targets for limiting the occurrence of global‐scale heat waves becomes even more apparent when considering climate model projections. We find that the probability of devastating 2018‐like areas to occur will increase drastically (from 65% to 97%) if global mean temperatures shift from +1.5 °C to +2 °C. This is consistent with the recently approved IPCC special report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, which finds significantly stronger climate‐related impacts for +2 °C compared to +1.5 °C warming (IPCC,
