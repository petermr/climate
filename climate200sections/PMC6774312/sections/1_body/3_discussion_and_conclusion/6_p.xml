<p>Our results demonstrate that the GCWH18 extreme event could not have occurred without human‐induced climate change. Due to taking averages over large areas, the signal‐to‐noise ratio is high for such events, and we could exclude that it could have occurred as part of natural variability. To our knowledge, so far only for marine heat waves, it could be concluded that their occurrence would not have been possible without climate change (Oliver et al.,
