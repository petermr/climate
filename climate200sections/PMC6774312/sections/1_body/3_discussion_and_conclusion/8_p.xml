<p>In contrast to the local heat impacts on population, widely spread agricultural regions can serve as an integrator of heat‐related impacts on crop yields (Lobell &amp; Field, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Concurrent heat extremes in different agricultural regions can amplify heat impacts as simultaneous production shocks can increase global food prizes and food insecurity (Tigchelaar et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Multiple heat waves that occur subsequently in the same region can amplify heat wave impacts and are projected to increase with global warming (Baldwin et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Furthermore, a higher probability of experiencing a heat wave naturally increases the likelihood of compound extremes. In particular, the co‐occurrence rate of compound drought‐heat wave events will increase even if there is no trend in drought occurrence (Diffenbaugh et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Zscheischler &amp; Seneviratne, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and may exacerbate heat‐related impacts (Miralles et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Seneviratne et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Such compound events in space and time are challenging to analyze but require immediate attention because climate change will shift many aspects of these events (Zscheischler et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
