<p>The provided scaling relationship for concurrent hot day areas (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c) can help to assess future risk of heat‐related impacts. However, it also illustrates that concomitant heat waves in large parts of the inhabited and agricultural land area in the northern midlatitudes can be effectively prevented by limiting global warming. To avoid major future impacts associated with human‐induced global heat waves, we have to take ambitious mitigation actions to strongly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
