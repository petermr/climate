<p>To estimate the human influence on climate extremes, a common approach is to compute the change in likelihood of events such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation events. Hereby, the ratio is calculated between the likelihood of the event in a climate with anthropogenic forcing (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CC</italic>
 </sub>) and the likelihood in a reference period with smaller or no anthropogenic forcing (

 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>=0, that is, the probability ratio equals

 <sub>0</sub> for exceeding different concurrent hot day areas between 0% and 65% for the reference period (1958–1988) for CMIP5 models and observations. Since the climate has already warmed since preindustrial times by +0.28 °C, we perform the same computation for a preindustrial period (1870–1900). We further compute

 <sub>
  <italic>cc</italic>
 </sub> for different concurrent hot day areas for 31‐year periods in which global warming reached +1 °C, +1.5 °C, and +2 °C for the same area thresholds (this results in slightly different 30‐year periods for each model). For comparison, we also compute
