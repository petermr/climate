<p>We estimate global mean temperature increase in CMIP5 models by computing 31‐year moving averages of global mean temperature (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub>) for all models between 1958 and 2100 and determine changes relative to the observational reference period 1958–1988. We estimate 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub> as weighted mean between 
 <italic>tas</italic> over land and (dynamic) sea ice regions and sea surface temperature (
 <italic>tos</italic> in CMIP5) over the oceans, similar to observations (also called “blended temperatures” Cowtan et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The multimodel mean warming between the reference period and 1870–1900 is +0.28 °C and is added to changes relative to the reference period. The warming levels of 1, 1.5, and 2 °C are determined as 31‐year periods such that 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub> in the center year is closest to the respective warming level. For the scaling of 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub> with the concurrent hot day area, we relate the center year of each 31‐year mean 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub> with the its respective concurrent hot day area. We use a distance weighting of each individual model to obtain values closest to 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>glob</sub> and then compute multimodel median and interquartile range. We then apply a linear filter by 0.1 °C to smooth the data and improve the visual appearance.
