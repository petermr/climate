<p>In this study we investigate the extensive spatially distributed heat impacts of the 2018 boreal summer as a single event. We compute the daily 90th temperature percentile using a 31‐day moving window for the reference period 1958–1988, resulting in a 90th percentile climatology of the reference period for each model and the observed data. Each day between May and July that exceeds the temperature of the respective calendar day in the 90th percentile climatology is defined as a hot day. We then regrid results from each model to the NH AgPop area grid and only consider the NH AgPop area for subsequent analyses. The average concurrent hot day area of a year is then defined as the average daily spatial extent of locations that experience a hot day between May and July. To obtain relative concurrent hot day areas, the average yearly concurrent hot day area is divided by the total area of the NH AgPop area. In addition to the concurrent hot day area between May and July, we also compute the concurrent hot day area between May to August and May to September (
