<p>In the present study, we investigate the exceptional nature of the 2018 north hemispheric heat wave in the context of anthropogenic climate change. We first synthesize reported heat‐related impacts across the entire Northern Hemisphere in the spring to summer season. Subsequently, we investigate the fraction of the land area in the northern midlatitudes that is either densely populated or used for agricultural production and that was affected by extremely hot conditions. We then study whether current Earth System Models simulate a 2018‐like area fraction under present‐day conditions and whether the event could have occurred without climate change. Finally, we provide estimates of how such an event will develop under unabated global warming.</p>
