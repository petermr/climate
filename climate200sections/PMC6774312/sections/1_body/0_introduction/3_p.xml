<p>Given the tremendous impacts of these heat waves, the question arises how much they can be attributed to human activities. Most recent heat waves have been attributed to a smaller or larger extent to anthropogenic climate change (NAS, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). For instance, anthropogenic climate change has tripled the occurrence rate of heat waves similar to the 2010 heat wave in Russia (Otto et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Rahmstorf &amp; Coumou, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Heat waves of the magnitude of the Indian heat wave in May/June 2015 are 2 to 8 times more likely due to human‐induced climate change (Wehner et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). A near‐real‐time attribution study concluded that the extreme heat in northern Europe in the 2018 summer was on average 2 times more likely due to human‐induced climate change (World Weather Attribution, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, in these cases, as in many other heat wave attribution studies, natural variability cannot be excluded as a driver.
