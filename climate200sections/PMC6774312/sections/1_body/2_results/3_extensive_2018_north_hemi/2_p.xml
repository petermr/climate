<p>Between May and July 2018, some regions experienced hot days for up to 2 months, including Scandinavia, central Europe, and the United States (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The mean temperature anomaly of the hot days in these regions was up to 1.4 °C warmer than the 90th percentile daily temperatures in the reference period (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Owing to the associated exposure, heat wave impacts were particularly severe over the NH AgPop regions (see section
