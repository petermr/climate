<p>Between May and July 2018, heat‐related impacts have been described for at least 18 countries in the northern midlatitudes for different sectors, Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showcases a number of reported impacts. The URLs and news agencies of the media articles are provided in Table 
 <xref rid="eft2570-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Affected countries include Canada and the United States in North America, many European countries, as well as Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea in Asia. The wide spatial extent of impacts illustrates the global dimension of the extreme temperatures. News agencies reported direct heat‐related impacts on humans and also on agriculture, power plants, and infrastructure (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). For instance, in Quebec, more than 70 people died from heat strokes. In the United States, around 35 million people lived with regular heat warnings through July. In Japan, at least 30 people died and more than 2,500 were sent to hospital. Devastating fires destroyed vast amounts of intact forests in Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Greece, and South Korea. The hot temperatures also caused crop loss particularly for grains in Germany, Russia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The heat wave conditions further led to power shortages and reduction in power production in the United States, Germany, France, and Switzerland. Roads melted and train tracks buckled in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
