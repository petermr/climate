 <caption> Detrended ring width increments (a) of provenances summarized by regions as shown in Figure 1. The standard error of each group is represented by colored transparent bands. Panels b, c, and d show anomalies in temperature, moisture deficit, and precipitation relative to the normal climate conditions of the test site. The integral from the zero value shown as colored area visualizes the severity of extreme climate events, integrating the size and length of the anomaly. Two drought periods around 1998â€“1999 (Drought 1) and 2002 (Drought 2) were highlighted within dark gray bars. Missing values of the weather station record at the test site were represented by light gray bars </caption>
