<p>A commonly used approach to study local adaptation of populations, the adaptive capacity of a species, and genetic variability in adaptive traits is provenance and progeny field trials. In these experiments, seed sources from different origins, sometimes with a known pedigree, are grown in a common garden to reveal intra‐species genetic variance. Provenance and progeny trials for white spruce have been evaluated for disease resistance (Alfaro, He, Kiss, King, &amp; Yanchuk,
