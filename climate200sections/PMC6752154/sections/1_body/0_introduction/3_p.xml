<p>White spruce (
 <italic>Picea glauca</italic> (Moench) Voss) is one of the most common and widely distributed boreal forest species in North America. The species is also commercially important and comprises roughly a quarter of the Canadian Forest Inventory (NRC, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Dendrochronological and inventory plot‚Äêbased research has identified the species as sensitive to growth reductions under warming and increased moisture deficits expected under climate change projections. Water deficits limit the range of white spruce at the southern fringe (Chhin &amp; Wang,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), droughts caused significant mortality of white spruce (Peng et al.,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) showed that moisture stress reduced growth due to recent climate trends, and D'Orangeville et al. (
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) predict that white spruce is more sensitive to growth reductions under increased temperature than other boreal species.
