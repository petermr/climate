<p>Here, we contribute a dendrochronological analysis of white spruce provenances from throughout the range sources of the species, grown for almost four decades in a common garden experiment at a centrally located test site that already experienced above‐average water deficits compared to the species range under normal conditions. The test site has been exposed to severe drought periods in 1999 and 2002 that caused significant growth reductions and mortality of tree species in the region, offering a unique opportunity to study drought response of genotypes in a common garden environment where environmental variation is uniform and experimentally controlled. Specifically, (1) we quantify drought resistance, recovery, and resilience of boreal spruce populations from throughout the range; (2) we evaluate drought tolerance traits in the context of long‐term growth performance and survival; and (3) we interpret correlations between drought tolerance and growth metrics in the context of the origin climate of provenances to infer local adaptation. The results are discussed in the context of sensitivity to growth reductions under climate change and possible climate change adaptation strategies to maintain health and productivity of one of the ecologically and commercially most important boreal forest tree species.</p>
