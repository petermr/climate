<p>Climate data of seed source origins were obtained using the software ClimateNA v5.21 (Wang, Hamann, Spittlehouse, &amp; Carroll, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). We used the climate period 1961â€“1990 as a representation of normal climate conditions. The period is a compromise between weather station coverage and representing climate conditions to which populations are putatively adapted. Prior to 1961, weather station coverage becomes sparse leading to inaccurate climate estimates, and subsequent to 1990, there is a significant anthropogenic warming signal. Provenances were grouped into six regions considering geographic location of the provenances (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) as well as climate conditions summarized by a principal component analysis (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The groups approximately corresponded to the Canadian ecoregion classifications (Boreal Cordillera, Boreal Plains, Boreal Shield, Maritime Mixedwood, Montane Cordillera, and Temperate Mixedwood), and we use these names throughout the text when referring to populations of white spruce within these regions. Principal component analysis was implemented with the 
 <italic>princomp</italic> () function of the stats package using the correlation matrix. We also generate maps of current and projected water deficits for the range of white spruce with the same ClimateNA v5.21 software package, using gridded data publicly available at
