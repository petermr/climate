<p>To evaluate the cross‐dating reliability of the complete chronology (from 1988 to 2017), we calculated the expressed population signal (EPS) according to Wigley, Briffa, and Jones (
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>) for all 165 individuals. An exceptionally high value (EPS = 0.99) suggested near‐perfect cross‐dating, but this is an expected result for trees grown in a randomized common garden where environmental variation is experimentally controlled. In natural stands, an EPS of 0.85 is considered sufficiently consistent (Speer,
