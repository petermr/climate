<p>All chronologies shared a strong growth reduction in 1999, corresponding to a low precipitation period from 1997 winter to 1999 (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d, first gray bar Drought 1, area colored red below normal expectation). The precipitation shortage was especially noticeable during the summers when most precipitation falls at the test site in a normal year. This drier‐than‐normal period was also remarkably warm (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), causing a severe moisture deficit that resulted in reduced growth for all provenances (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,c). The second pronounced growth reduction (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Drought 2) occurred in 2002, coinciding with an unusually cold spring and a moderately dry summer during the year. Growth of provenances did not fully recover before this second drought period, and the response to the second drought might therefore be influenced by the first drought period as well. This second drought in 2002 was shorter than the first in 1999 at the study site, but it is still recorded as one of the most serious prairie droughts in the last several decades (Bonsal &amp; Regier,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The average growth response of regional populations was reasonably precise and constant over time as indicated by standard errors of around 0.3 mm ring width.
