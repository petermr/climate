<p>Regional population differentiation was also readily apparent in annual growth increments with the local provenances, Boreal Shield and Temperate Mixedwood sources being the best performers during the pre‚Äê and postdisturbance periods (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). During the drought periods, provenances from all regions behaved similarly with reduced ring width increments, but the decreased measurements in percent of the predisturbance productivity (resistance) were inversely proportional to the normal growth rates before disturbance: 31% loss of growth (i.e., 69% resistance in 1999) for the most resistant Boreal Cordillera sources versus over 56% reduction for the sources from the Temperate Mixedwood and Boreal Shield regions (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For the 2002 drought, the percent reduction in growth was less differentiated (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with no significant regional differences in resistance (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Provenances from all regions recovered approximately to their predisturbance levels, indicating no permanent damage after two consecutive drought events. Unlike the 1999 event, the 2002 growth reduction showed no statistically significant regional differences of resistance or recovery.
