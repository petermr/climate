<p>These results have implications for seed movement as an adaptation strategy for climate change. Human‐assisted migration as part of regular reforestation programs has been proposed to match planting stock with anticipated new environments, as populations become progressively mismatched with the climate to which they are adapted (Aitken &amp; Bemmels,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec updated seed transfer rules to facilitate assisted migration through seed movement in their regular reforestation programs (O’Neill et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, genetic differentiation among populations is a necessary requirement for assisted migration prescriptions to be effective. If no genetic differentiations can be identified in drought resilience or for maintenance of growth under drought conditions, seed movement may have not been able to improve drought tolerance in areas that are expected to have high water deficits.
