<p>While we did not observe drought‐induced mortality or dieback at this specific experiment, water deficits limit the range of white spruce at the southern fringe (Chhin &amp; Wang,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) and have caused mortality of white spruce in the west (Peng et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In comparison with five other boreal species, D'Orangeville et al. (
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) found that white spruce appears to be especially prone to growth reductions under all climate simulations above 2°C warming. While white spruce did not show massive mortality in response to drought as other species have (Worrall et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), their general fitness appears compromised. Searle and Chen (
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) showed a long‐term trend towards reduced abundance of late‐successional conifers (represented by 93% white spruce), with the strongest reductions observed in western Alberta, and they attributed the trend to warming and increases in CO2.
