 <p id="Par1">Climate change has significant impacts on the distribution of species and alters ecological processes that result from species interactions. There is concern that such distribution shifts will affect animal-plant pollination networks. We modelled the potential future (2050 and 2070) distribution of an endangered migratory bat species (
  <italic>Leptonycteris nivalis</italic>) and the plants they pollinate (
  <italic>Agave</italic> spp) during their annual migration from central Mexico to the southern United States. Our models show that the overlap between the 
  <italic>Agave</italic> and the endangered pollinating bat will be reduced by at least 75%. The reduction of suitable areas for 
  <italic>Agave</italic> species will restrict the foraging resources available for the endangered bat, threatening the survival of its populations and the maintenance of their pollination service. The potential extinction of the bat 
  <italic>L. nivalis</italic> will likely have negative effects on the sexual reproduction and genetic variability of 
  <italic>Agave</italic> plants increasing their vulnerability to future environmental changes.
