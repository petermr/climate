<p id="Par10">We combined the presence area maps for all agave species into one map representing the presence of one or more agaves. The overlap of this map with the suitable area map for 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> under current climatic conditions is 26.2% and under all the future scenarios there is at least a 75% decrease in overlap percentage relative to current distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We also project a change in the pattern of richness with a smaller proportion of areas with one or more agave species present in future scenarios than under current climate conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
