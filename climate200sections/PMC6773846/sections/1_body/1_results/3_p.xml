<p id="Par9">The future models show a small expansion of suitable areas for six of the species in at least one of the RCPs and time frames. 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> show slight increases in suitable areas in all the scenarios. The highest gain for 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> is 5% under RCP 4.5 and 2050 projection, and for 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> is 2% under two different scenarios. However, the gains are trivial relative to the magnitude of the losses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The overall trend for all the species is that the suitable areas would retreat to higher elevation areas in every future scenario considered in this study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
