<p id="Par5">The Mexican long-nosed bat (
 <italic>Leptonycteris nivalis</italic>), migrates up to 1200 km north from central Mexico to the south-western United States every spring, following the blooms of paniculate agaves
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,

 </sup>. This bat species is listed as endangered by the United States

 </sup>, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN Red List)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> due to declines in populations of over 50% in the past ten years. The bats travel a corridor that follows the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, beginning in the south-western United States, tracking areas of high agave richness
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Authors have pointed out that the migration of long-nosed bats is an “endangered phenomenon” because of its complexity (scarcity of roosting sites with ideal conditions and scarcity of flowering agave)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Losing the 
 <italic>Leptonycteris-Agave</italic> interaction has ecological and economic implications because agaves play a critical role in maintaining soil stability in arid and semi-arid ecosystems and have socio-economic value, providing food and cultural services for humans in the form of natural fibres and traditional beverages, such as tequila and mescal
