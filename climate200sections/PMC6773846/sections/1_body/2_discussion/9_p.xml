<p id="Par19">The local extirpation or extinction of the bat 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> could have a negative effect on the sexual reproduction and genetic variability of agaves, increasing their vulnerability to future environmental and climatic changes. Whether changes in the current distributions and elevational tolerances of the other two species. 
 <italic>L. yerbabuenae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. mexicana</italic>, might compensate for the loss of 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> is hard to assess. Their current distributions and elevational limits differ from 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>, as likely do their preferences for different agave species. The persistence of the 
 <italic>Agave</italic>-
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> interaction over the long-term is one component for mitigating the detrimental effects of future climate change in arid and semi-arid ecosystems of Mexico and the United States by maintaining agave species important for ecosystem function and community well-being. Maintaining this pollination corridor is critical, and adaptation measures should include careful monitoring of agave declines so that richness of native agave species is maintained in suitable areas for 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>. Assisted migration of tolerant agave species may become a necessary response to protect this important pollination complex.
