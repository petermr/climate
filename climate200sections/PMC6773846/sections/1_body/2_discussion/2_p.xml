<p id="Par12">Under most climate change scenarios, it is expected that suitable environments for species will be reduced to a higher degree under the extreme high-end RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5. There were several exceptions that appear to be related to species that currently occur in the arid end of the spectrum for current distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>A. parryi</italic>, 
 <italic>A. havardiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. gentryi</italic> show greater losses of suitable habitat under RCP 4.5 in 2050 compared to RCP 8.5, suggesting more tolerance to more extreme climate change in the intermediate time frame. In addition, 
 <italic>A. asperrima</italic> as well as 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> exhibited less contraction of suitable area under RCP 8.5 both in 2050 and 2070. This suggests that species currently adapted to high aridity are slightly less impacted than less arid adapted species
