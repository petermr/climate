 </sup> provided guidelines for the selection of appropriate variables in a study similar to ours and we followed their approach. We first eliminated those variables with the highest and most significant correlation coefficients (r &gt; 0.5 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) determined using Spearman correlations. We then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the relative importance of the non-correlated variables that explained the highest variance within the current climatic niche of each species based on the occurrence data. As a result different variables were selected for modelling each species distribution (Supplementary Information Table
