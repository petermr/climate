<p id="Par33">We compared the performance of the models produced with Maxent and GARP employing the partial AUC (Area Under the Curve) ratio with the computer program Partial ROC
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. Partial ROC evaluates the models in terms of statistical significance by generating null expectations and it is an accepted measure of model evaluation
