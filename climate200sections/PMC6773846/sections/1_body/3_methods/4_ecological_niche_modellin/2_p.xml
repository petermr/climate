<p id="Par31">Maxent, maximum entropy modelling, estimates the ecological niche of species based on the location of maximum entropy distributions. We used the default Maxent program settings (version 3.3.3), except for the “extrapolation” and “clamping” options, which were disabled to avoid unrealistic extrapolations in the extreme values of the bioclimatic variables.</p>
