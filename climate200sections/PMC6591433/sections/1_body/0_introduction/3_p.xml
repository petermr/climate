<p>Concurrent with growing awareness of climate change, researchers are also reporting increasing levels of concern (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gatersleben et al., 2010</xref>). Well-documented responses to perceived catastrophic and large scale impacts and threats include a sense of disempowerment and helplessness (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Oâ€™Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>), and even anxiety and depression (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Searle and Gow, 2010</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al. (2015)</xref>, having surveyed over 5,000 people, reported that about one-third of Australians believed environmental quality was worsening as a result of climate change and felt angry about it (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al. (2019)</xref> have reported that around half of coastal residents, tourists and tourist operators, and almost one quarter of commercial fishers in the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef, expressed significant grief after reports of the degrading state of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) resulting from climate change-related events (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>). Ecological grief is a phenomenon that needs to be better acknowledged in order to better understand the range of responses that occur in response to understanding what the consequences of climate change mean (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barnett et al., 2016</xref>). Ecological grief describes the emotional suffering associated with losses to valued species, ecosystems and landscapes that occur as a result of climate change (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bartual, 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018</xref>). Indeed, researchers are considering a new science, a science of loss, to document and make sense of the feelings associated with the devastation that climate change is causing (
