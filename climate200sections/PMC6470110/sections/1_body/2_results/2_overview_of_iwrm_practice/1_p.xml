 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the results of the City Blueprint analyses in the selected cities according to categorisation shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The BCI scores span a large range of 2.0 to 8.1. Jakarta, HCMC, Bandung, Bangkok, Manila and Ahmedabad are grouped among cities with low BCIs. According to Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, these six cities can be categorised as 
 <italic>wasteful cities</italic> (BCI 2–4), where basic water services are mostly covered but flood risk exists and waste management is poor. Taipei, Tianjin and Hohhot are categorised as 
 <italic>water efficient cities</italic> (BCI 4–6) where infrastructure and technologies in addressing basic water services, solid waste and wastewater treatment are more developed. Finally, Seoul and Singapore have implemented measures to be self-sufficient and circular. They categorise as 
 <italic>resource efficient and adaptive cities</italic> (BCI 6–8).
