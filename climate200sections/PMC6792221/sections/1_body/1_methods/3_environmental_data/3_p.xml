 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Each GCM exhibits different climate scenarios or representative concentration pathways (RCPs), which represent different ways of greenhouse gas concentrations resulting in radiative forcing, depending on human activity mitigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Scenarios are: (i) RCP 2.6, considered an optimistic scenario for maximum mitigation; (ii) RCP 4.5 and (iii) RCP 6.0, considered stabilization scenarios, in which there is increased radiative forcing but it stabilizes; and (iv) RCP 8.5, the most pessimistic scenario, in which higher levels of radiative forcing are recorded and the increase in temperature does not stop [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. For future scenarios, we used five GCMs with the climatic projections for 2070: CCSM4 (CC, hereafter), GISS-E2-R (GS, hereafter), HadGEM-ES (HE, hereafter), IPSL-CM5A-LR (IP, hereafter) and MIROC-ESM (MR, hereafter). Each of the selected GCM has the four RCPs available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. These RCPs have 19 bioclimatic variables in raster format. The RCPs were obtained from climate model simulations planned as part of the World Climate Research Programmeâ€™s Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) [
