<p id="Par19">Based on the hypothesis of accessible areas by dispersal over relevant time periods (M, hereafter) for both 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], we set 2° (~222 km) buffer areas around each occurrence. The genus 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> is a dispersal restricted group, given that most developmental stages disperse by walking, unlike winged males that can also fly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; therefore, the accessible areas used were conservative compared to previous reports [e.g. 35, 37]. This buffer was constrained by the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, which constitute geomorphological features that 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> species would not naturally overcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These areas were used to extract the background data for modelling each species niche (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We analysed the correlation among the selected variables within these calibration areas using 10,000 random points plus occurrences in R project v.3.4.1 (
 <italic>Stats</italic> and 
 <italic>corrplot</italic> packages) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].
