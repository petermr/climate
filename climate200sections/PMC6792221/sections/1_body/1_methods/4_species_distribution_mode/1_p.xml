<p id="Par21">SDMs were constructed using Maxent v.3.3.3k [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This software predicts species distribution, correlating sets of environmental predictors across a user-defined landscape that is divided into grid cells, with species occurrences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Maxent is a machine-learning method that assesses the probability of a species distribution, by estimating a probability of distribution function of maximum entropy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The method uses randomly selected pseudo-absences within an 
 <italic>a priori</italic>-defined background area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Maxent generally performs better than other software commonly used for SDMs; it has been widely used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and its ability to make predictions is supported when occurrence records are scarce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], as in this case. Maxentâ€™s average performance was among the first algorithms tested in the Classic BAM (Biotic Abiotic Mobility) scenario and also for species with narrow niche breadth, but its results were variable depending on the measuring test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. No algorithm will be optimal under all circumstances because there is not a single best approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].
