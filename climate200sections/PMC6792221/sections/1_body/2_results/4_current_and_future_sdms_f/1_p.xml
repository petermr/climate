<p id="Par28">The minimum suitability value of 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> occurrences used as threshold for its binary prediction was 0.0126. All probability values below that number were considered non-suitable areas. The suitability area predicted under current climatic conditions for 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> (317,580 km
 <sup>2</sup>) showed that the potential areas have similarities to its known distribution, including the inland valleys and, to a lesser extent, coastal areas and the Andes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the current potential distribution extended to the north. This species showed an increased suitability inland in the Atacama Region but a reduction of suitability in the Atacama Desert, with some potential presence north in Peru (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It slightly extended south, encompassing approximately from 7° to 35°S.
