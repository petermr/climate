<p id="Par25">The final model for 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> included the five environmental variables mentioned above. The correlation coefficients are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2. Bio12 had a percent contribution of 60.6 and a permutation importance of 41.7, followed by Bio10 (30.8; 39.7), Bio7 (6.0; 9.9), Bio11 (4.0; 7.6) and Bio2 (1.2; 1.2). The final model for 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> included all the above variables except for Bio10, since this variable showed 0% of contribution in the first model (i.e. first run including the same variables used for 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic>), so it was not included in the following analyses. Bio2 had a percent contribution of 94.4 and a permutation importance of 37.6, followed by Bio11 (3.0; 21.3), Bio12 (2.2; 40.7) and Bio7 (0.4; 0.4). The correlation coefficients are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S3 and the response curvesâ€™ figures for these variables are available in the repository.
