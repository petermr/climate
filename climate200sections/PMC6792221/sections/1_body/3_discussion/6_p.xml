<p id="Par39">When analysing the overlap between the current potential distribution from both species, we detected an overlap area encompassing around 24°40′ to 26°35′S by the coast, an area presenting another 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> species, 
 <italic>M. parapatrica</italic>. In this zone, it has been reported that climatic and ecologic characteristics are intermediate from those where 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> and 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> inhabit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In our study, we confirm that the climate of this area would be suitable for both 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic>, without discarding that hybridization could be occurring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. There is another area where both species’ current potential distributions overlap, mainly near the coast of Peru, but neither of these species have been reported. We suggest that this area should be sampled, to assess if any member of the 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> genus are present, especially considering that this area is currently colonized by triatomine species from the 
 <italic>Triatoma</italic> and 
 <italic>Panstrongylus</italic> genus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Therefore, the ecological conditions, including biotic and abiotic factors, might be conducive for triatomine colonization.
