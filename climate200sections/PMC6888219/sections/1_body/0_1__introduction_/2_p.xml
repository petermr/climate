 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which in turn will adversely affect the coastal region of the tropical and sub-tropical developing countries because of their over-dependence on natural resource-based livelihoods such as agriculture [

The agriculture of the deltaic region will be more affected because of land submergence, salinization of soil and fresh groundwater, and losses caused by permanent coastal erosion with consequences of farm production, livelihood diversification, household well-being, and food security [
