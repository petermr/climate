<p>Vulnerability to climate change is driven by biophysical and socio-economic factors that intensify the susceptibility of a community to the impact of climatic stressors [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many of the studies focusing on climate change risk and adaptation considered vulnerability assessment, and a majority of them interpreted vulnerability as a pre-existing condition while some others considered as an outcome [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Over the decades, the concept of vulnerability has evolved from many research disciplines: human ecology, political ecology, physical science, and spatial analysis [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and these diverse approaches have resulted in different interpretations of the term ‘vulnerability’. However, much of the literature on vulnerability has applied the IPCC definition: “the degree to which a system is susceptible to and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. The vulnerability is a function of the characters, magnitude, and rate of climate change and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In general, there are two approaches to measuring vulnerability, i.e., vulnerability variable assessments, and the indicator approach [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Currently, indicator-based assessments are one of the most common ways to quantify climate change-led vulnerability [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but they have faced widespread criticism for not being able to capture the complexity of vulnerable systems [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and their lack of uniformity, particularly in the process of selecting the indicators, scale of measurement, weighting, variable transformation, and aggregation [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; indeed, this remains a challenging task in constructing a robust vulnerability index [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, there is consensus among the scientific community that indicator-based assessments can serve as a decent starting point for the analysis and discussion of vulnerability [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], especially when visualization techniques are applied [
