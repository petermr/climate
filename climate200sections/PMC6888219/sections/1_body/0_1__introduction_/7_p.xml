<p>Therefore, this study aims to (i) develop a framework for assessing agricultural livelihood vulnerability to climate change and apply it to the coastal region of Bangladesh; (ii) map out the hot spots of vulnerability distribution; (iii) identify critical factors of spatially heterogeneous vulnerability; and (iv) support intervention planning for climate change adaptation. The agricultural livelihood vulnerability index (ALVI) model, built upon the integration of socioeconomic, agro-ecological, and biophysical variables (64 in all) in the vulnerability concept is a novel approach because it adds some new robust indicators such as a salinity severity index, arsenic problems, and the use of different agro-technologies. </p>
