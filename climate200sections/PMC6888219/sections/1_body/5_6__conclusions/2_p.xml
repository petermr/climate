<p>The investigation, using an ALVI framework in coastal Bangladesh—a representative area of integrated and subsistence agricultural farming, which is particularly threatened by climate change—revealed that the agricultural livelihoods of 22.75 million people in 9 administrative districts are predominantly vulnerable to climate change, most notably (i) the Bhola district, due to low soil phosphorus and organic matter content, a larger area of rain-fed cropland, low crop diversity and productivity (sensitivity); the lowest level of foreign remittances, income diversity, agro-technology use, structurally sound houses (adaptive capacity); and high levels of erosion, drought, and cyclones (exposure); and (ii) the Patuakhali district, due to salinity intrusion, drought, and cyclones (exposure); low cropping intensity, diversity and productivity, and a larger area of rain-fed cropland (sensitivity); relatively lower levels of literacy, structurally sound houses, road density, electricity, and agro-technology use (adaptive capacity). </p>
