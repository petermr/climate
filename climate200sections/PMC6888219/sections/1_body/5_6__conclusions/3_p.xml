<p>The hot spot of vulnerability distribution was concentrated in the rural agricultural districts (Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur), where livelihoods are mainly dependent on crop-based farming and are continuously threatened by multiple climatic disasters such as floods, erosion, and cyclones. On the other hand, the vulnerability cold spots were distributed along the worldâ€™s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, which offers numerous livelihood opportunities and reduces the vulnerability of surrounding districts (Satkhira, Khulna, Jessore, and Narail) by providing an ecological buffer against climatic disasters. Furthermore, the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability among the coastal districts was influenced by the indicators of exposure (rate of erosion, cyclones, and drought); sensitivity (infant mortality rate, distance to water source, unhygienic sanitation conditions, land degradation, soil phosphorus, rain-fed agricultural land, productivity of rice); and adaptive capacity (structurally sound housing and density of emergency shelters, open waterbody, adoption of improved crop varieties, pesticides, and irrigation facilities). </p>
