<p>The proposed assessment method provides a concrete example of a set of potential adaptation measures for specific geographical units that will assist policymakers in prioritizing investments for intervention. For example, diversification of agricultural systems by allowing water-intensive crops; adoption of farming technology (crop variety, harvester use, irrigation pumps); construction of dams and roads, and enhancing the plantation mangrove forest program, are some of the potential adaptation options for the most vulnerable district, Bhola. These measures could reduce the sensitivity and modify the agricultural systemâ€™s exposure to stressors such as flood, erosion, drought, and cyclones. Subsequently, findings of this study may accelerate the shift of adaptation efforts to areas with greater exposure, increased sensitivity, or lower adaptive capacity. </p>
