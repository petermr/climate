<p>The relative weights of the 64 indicators (see 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-04552-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) under three major components were estimated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The consistency ratio (CR) in AHP ranged between 0.1 and 8.8%, which was satisfactory [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">supplementary materials and Tables S2 and S3</xref>). Since different variables affect vulnerability unevenly, the equal weight method was not used. Moreover, statistical methods are often criticized for ignoring local knowledge and traditional values [
