<p>Seven Landsat TM and OLI-TIRS scenes (30Ã—30-m resolution) covering the entire coastal region of Bangladesh for the years 1998 and 2018 were collected from the LSDS Science Research and Development (LSRD) database of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (
 <uri xlink:href="https://espa.cr.usgs.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://espa.cr.usgs.gov/</uri>) (free of cost); these were used to calculate the land use/land cover (LULC) changes (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Figure S1 and Table S1</xref>). The rate of riverbank erosion (km/year) was estimated based on the dynamics of LULC change [
