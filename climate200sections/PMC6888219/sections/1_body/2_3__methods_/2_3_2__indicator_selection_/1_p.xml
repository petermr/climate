<p>In general, three diverse research streams are underlined in the literature regarding agricultural vulnerability to climate change: biophysical, agro-ecological, and socioeconomic aspects [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The biophysical aspects consider agricultural systems’ exposure to climate change and variability by incorporating indicators like precipitation variability, the occurrence of flood, drought, and environmental degradation [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The agro-ecological dimensions are represented by the sensitivity of farmland and production to climate shocks [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The socioeconomic aspect is reflected by analyzing climate change’s impact on agricultural productivity and farm income [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as well as social vulnerability, which primarily incorporates indicators relating to vulnerable social groups and their capacity to adapt to climate change [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The indicator method of this study consists of 64 indicators (see details in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-04552-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) reflecting socioeconomic, agro-ecological, and biophysical variables.
