<p>Since uncertainty is interlinked with climate change, exposure is beyond the reach of policy interventions. However, adopting suitable policy interventions for reducing sensitivity and enhancing adaptive capacity could reduce vulnerability [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To this end, district-wise sensitivity and adaptive capacity index values were plotted on the X and Y axes, respectively, of a scatter diagram, to develop a decision matrix that could help identify socioeconomically vulnerable areas so that effective interventions could be taken, on a priority basis. Districts in the quadrants with SI scores ≤ 0.50 and ACI scores &gt; 0.5 were treated as low vulnerability areas, whereas highly vulnerable districts were recognized when SI score &gt; 0.5 ≤ ACI score. Furthermore, the normalized relative values (rescaled) of the indicators under sensitivity and adaptive capacity components were plotted on circumplex charts, to identify the drivers (sensitivity indicator value &gt; 0.5 ≥ adaptive capacity indicator value) and buffers (sensitivity indicator value ≤ 0.5 &lt; adaptive capacity indicator value) by using the mean value (0.5) as a threshold boundary.
