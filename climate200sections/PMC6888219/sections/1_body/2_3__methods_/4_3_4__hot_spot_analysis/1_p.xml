<p>We used an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) technique—spatial autocorrelation—to analyze the distribution characteristics of ALVI across the coastal districts of Bangladesh. The spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed through GeoDa-1.12.1.161 software following the methodology of Jha and Haripriya (2019) [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In spatial autocorrelation, Moran’s I designates a value score range from +1 to −1, which indicates the spatial pattern between the neighboring regions and observations [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. A Moran’s I score that is close to +1 shows a strong similarity pattern between the high and low values, whereas −1 reflects a strong dissimilarity pattern indicating a varied pattern of high and low values. On the other hand, LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) identifies four types of spatial clusters—HH (high-high), HL (high-low), LH (low-high), and LL (low-low)—at the local level. An HH value indicates a region of high ALVI values surrounded by other regions of high ALVI values, and is referred to as ‘hot spot’; whereas LL values represent a region with low ALVI scores bounded by less vulnerable regions and is referred to as ‘cold spot’. The HL and LH areas are those with extreme values, reflecting a negative spatial autocorrelation, and are referred to as ‘spatial outliers’.
