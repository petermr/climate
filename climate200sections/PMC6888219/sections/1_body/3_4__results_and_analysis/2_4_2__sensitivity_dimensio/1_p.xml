<p>Agricultural susceptibility indicates the probability of the agricultural farming sectorâ€™s being affected by the impacts of climate change. Findings (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Figure S2 and Table S5</xref>) revealed that ten (Barisal, Chandpur, Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Patuakhali, Bhola, Lakshmipur, Pirojpur, and Jhalokati) out of the nineteen districts had high to very high levels of agricultural susceptibility, and their aggregated land area accounted for 56.52% of the total study area. The Patuakhali district had the highest susceptibility score (0.315) of agricultural practices sub-dimension, which corresponded to a significant proportion of marginalized farm holdings (34.24%), crop area (60.43%), rain-fed agricultural land (95.54%), with a higher gross agricultural production (1.15), and low yield (1.99 ton/ha) of rice.
