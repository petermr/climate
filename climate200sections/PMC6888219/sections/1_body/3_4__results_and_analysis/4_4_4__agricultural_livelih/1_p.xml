 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Table S4</xref>) revealed that three (Bhola, Patuakhali, and Noakhali) out of the nineteen districts had very high levels of vulnerability, with ALVI scores of 0.759–0.882. The Bhola district—the only island district—ranked first in ALVI, which corresponds to very high exposure (0.651), moderate sensitivity (0.519), and very low adaptive capacity (0.342). The Barisal, Bagerhat, Barguna, Lakshmipur, Chittagong, and Cox’sbazar districts had ALVI scores of 0.605–0.716 and were grouped under the high vulnerability category. The aggregated land area of the high to very high vulnerability districts accounted for 59.60% of the total study area, signifying that 22.75 million people (59.07%) are highly vulnerable to climate change. The moderate vulnerability districts, with ALVI scores of 0.450–0.543. included Satkhira, Khulna, Pirojpur, Jhalokati, Feni, and Chandpur. Only four districts (Jessore, Narail, Gopalganj, and Shariatpur) had low to very low ALVI, and all of these districts are situated in the interior part of the western coastal region. This finding is in accord with Quader et al. (2017) [
