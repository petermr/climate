<p>The purpose of developing the ALVI model was to present an integrated assessment tool that can cover the multidimensionality of the aspect being assessed with minimal data limitations. It allows us to improve on the strategies utilized by prior studies, by covering all aspects of the coastal locale—rural and urban, island and mainland—and carefully utilizes a combination of census, survey, meteorological, and spatial data to overcome data limitations as far as possible. By using data from multiple years, the changes in ALVI score over a specific period can be measured. For instance, we have used most of the socioeconomic data for the year 2011, which could be used as baseline data to be compared to data on the same variables, which will be readily available in the year 2021 (the target year for the Bangladesh Government’s statistical division) and will allow the change in ALVI to be calculated over a 10-year period. </p>
