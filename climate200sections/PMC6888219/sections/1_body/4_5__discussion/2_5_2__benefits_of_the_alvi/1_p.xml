<p>The ALVI can be useful in assessing the impact and effectiveness of a program or policy by producing a model index value of contributing indicators and thereby yielding an updated ALVI score. For example, if the purpose of a disaster risk reduction program is to minimize crop loss, the length of dams being constructed in a geographical area over a stipulated period could be incorporated, and new ALVI scores calculated. The new ALVI could then be contrasted with the baseline ALVI to estimate the intervention’s effects on the district’s agricultural vulnerability to climate change. </p>
