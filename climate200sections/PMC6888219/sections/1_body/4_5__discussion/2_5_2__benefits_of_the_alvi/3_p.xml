<p>The ALVI approach uses a spatial autocorrelation technique to discover the hot spots of vulnerability distribution (

The results can be used to develop an intervention plan, to help policymakers target specific geographic locations where they can take intervention measures, easily selecting an area on a priority basis. Spatial autocorrelation also helps find the cold spotsâ€”the areas where vulnerability is very low, enabling progressive changes in the more vulnerable areas by copying the successful adaptation strategies of these cold spots.
