 </sup>. Some equatorial regions (especially the Atlantic) also have high cloud cover and, in such regions, the satellite product may be biased. Correlations between model and OC-CCI (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) are best for the low and high wavebands, and worst for the blue-green (490 and 510). These latter are the wavebands where the reversal of the patterns of high/low

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and are thus most difficult to capture correctly. For the same reason, these are the wavebands where the linear interpolation from the model bands to those of the OC-CCI products are most problematic. In general, the model has a low bias (Supplementary Fig.

 <sub>RS,</sub> with the most noticeable exception in the equatorial Pacific where the Chl-a mismatch bias occurs. The model also captures the patterns of the ratio of the interannual variability to the 18-year mean composite (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The major exception, again, is the equatorial Pacific where we have already noted the mismatch in placement of the interannual variability in Chl-a. The model is biased low in most other regions. However, the model does capture the lower ratio of interannual variability relative to the mean in the 490 and 510 nm than the other bands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig.
