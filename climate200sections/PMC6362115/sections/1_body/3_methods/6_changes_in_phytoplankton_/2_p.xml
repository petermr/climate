 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub> is a 15-year mean 2085–2100. To calculate trends, ToE, and provide output for Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>, we used annual average biomass for each year to construct yearly indices from 1995 to 2100. If there is no change in the community structure, the index will be 0. If there is a completely new community structure (i.e. no biomass of any of the original types), the index is 1. This index is calculated for each grid cell in the model.
