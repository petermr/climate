<p id="Par47">Nutrient distributions were initialized from results from previous simulations, though the results presented here were not sensitive to these initial conditions. The ecosystem was forced with the physical fields from the Earth System Model for the pre-industrial control and run for 50 years to allow the phytoplankton community and the upper ocean biogeochemistry to establish a quasi-equilibrium. A repeating seasonal cycle was quickly reached and there was only a small biogeochemical drift associated with upwelling of deep water. The several thousand years of integration needed to adjust the deep ocean was computationally unfeasible with the full ecosystem model. After the 50-year spin-up, the transient run from 1860 to 2100 was performed. A second simulation was conducted with no increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This control simulation showed that there were no significant drifts in the ecological or optical properties discussed in this study.</p>
