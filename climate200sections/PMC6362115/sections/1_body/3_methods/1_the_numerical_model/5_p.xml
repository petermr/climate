<p id="Par46">In this study, because of the high computational demand of the biogeochemical/ecosystem/optical numerical model, we use a single climate simulation from an ensemble of perturbed physics (climate sensitivity), perturbed initial conditions, and varied emissions scenarios. We focus on the climate simulation with a medium climate sensitivity (3.0 °C) under a business-as-usual scenario similar to the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)

 </sup>. The coupled system is spun up for 2000 years (using 1860 conditions) before simulating 1860 to 2100 changes. Observed concentrations of greenhouse gases, ozone and aerosols, including volcanic stratospheric aerosols, as well as solar irradiance are used to force the IGSM from 1860 to 2000, and 21st century climate simulations are driven by anthropogenic emissions simulated by the human activity model.
