<p id="Par52">We note that there is considerable effort to improve the derived Chl-a algorithms in the ocean colour community

 </sup>. Newer Chl-a products from NASA and OC-CCI use different algorithms in different regions of the ocean (e.g. low/high Chl-a or optically different provinces). Here, for simplicity we have focused on the simpler blue/green ratio OC4 algorithm. However, there are other approaches (e.g. semi-analytical inversion)

 </sup> that attempt to more mechanistically estimate not only Chl-a concentration, but other constituents such as CDOM. We believe that exploring whether this approach will allow climate change trends to be more rapidly or robustly detected will be a promising avenue for future study.
