 </sup>, with current products often using a blend of algorithm types depending on the region or water optical type (see e.g. the NASA Reprocessing 2014.0, and OC-CCI V3 release). However, algorithms based on reflectance ratios still use current day datasets to fit coefficients. We suggest that algorithm coefficients will need to be continuously adjusted based on subsets of newer in situ measurements as the optical properties of the ocean alter. On the other hand, there are also developments in semi-empirical inversion algorithms

 </sup> that also estimate the contributions of CDOM, particle backscattering, as well as Chl-a. As such, these techniques may be less affected by the changing relative importance of the different water constituents.
