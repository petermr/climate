<p id="Par9">A unique feature of this model is the explicit parameterization of upwelling and downwelling irradiance, such that we can calculate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> (see Methods). In the model, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> is resolved over the visible spectrum from 400 to 700 nm in 25 nm bands. We note that the model 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> does not have the uncertainties that the real world 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> has due to the atmospheric correction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> to the same bands as the satellite measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The model captures the reversed patterns between blue (443 nm) and green (555 nm) 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> between gyres and highly productive regions. The model underestimates the blue 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> in the subtropics where modelled Chl-a is likely too low relative to the real ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and the effects of salinity on the ocean optics, not resolved in the model, may become more important
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. The model has noticeably higher green (550 nm) 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> in the equatorial Atlantic and Indian Ocean than the satellite measurements, but this is consistent with the model over-estimating Chl-a relative to the satellite product in this region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These are also regions of high cloud cover where the satellite product may be biased.
