<p id="Par34">The results presented in this manuscript must be interpreted carefully, i.e. in the context of the ocean ecosystem and optical models simplified representation of the real world. Though relatively complex, the model still has only a limited number of optically different plankton species and does not include several important optical constituents (e.g. viruses, minerals

 </sup> that could impact the accuracy of the reflectance and also the ability to capture the natural interannual variability. The parameterization of CDOM and detrital matter is still simplistic, and we caution that the model cannot yet be used to make definitive comments on these changes, but can provide a unique chance to explore the potential alterations.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). However, there are discrepancies, with the model overestimating Chl-a in high latitudes and suggesting a much more limited region of variability in the Equatorial Pacific than observed. The interannual variability of

 <sub>RS</sub> at higher wavebands is also underestimated. These discrepencies suggests that the model is still missing important processes and constituents that affect variability. The model has relatively coarse (25 nm) wavebands, which differ in size and spacing from historic and current satellite sensors. Thus, the model can only provide broad estimates of the wavelengths, and cannot in its current form suggest bandwidths, that will encompass the strongest long term change signals. However, despite these caveats, the model provides a unique opportunity to investigate trends in ocean colour over the 21st century, and identify which signals will have the strongest response to anthropogenic climate change. Very few models currently include a radiative transfer component or simulate products such as reflectance
