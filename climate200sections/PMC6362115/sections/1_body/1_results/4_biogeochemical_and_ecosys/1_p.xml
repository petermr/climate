<p id="Par21">We first explore when the anthropogenic climate change signal exceeds the natural variability in Chl-a. We calculate the linear trend of Chl-a between 1995 and 2100 (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a, c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>) using a generalized least squares fit (see Methods). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, we show only regions with statistically significant trends (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). That the patterns in the trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>) are similar to the differences shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, gives confidence that a linear trend analysis is appropriate (note that Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows absolute differences and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref> shows % trend, which magnifies the changes at lower Chl-a). The North Atlantic shows a strong negative trend (less than −0.5%/year) and the North Pacific shows a weaker negative trend (alterations in limiting nutrient lead to a few regions showing a positive trend

 </sup>). However, we find that many regions of the ocean do not have a statistically significant trend over the 21st century.
