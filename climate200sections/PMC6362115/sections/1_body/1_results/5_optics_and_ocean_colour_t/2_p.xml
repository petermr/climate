<p id="Par28">Globally, all wavebands of the model reflectance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10g</xref>) have a stronger trend than the individual optically important water constituents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b–d</xref>) other than community structure changes. However, given that the model underestimates the natural variability especially in the high wavebands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), we focus only on our results for the lower (&lt;600 nm) wavelength bands.
