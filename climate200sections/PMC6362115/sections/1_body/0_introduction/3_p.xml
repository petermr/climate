<p id="Par5">However, a key question remains: How long will it take to detect an unambiguous signal of climate change in phytoplankton populations? Modelling studies have been used to caution that it will take many decades for significant trends in Chl-a and primary production to be detectable

 </sup>. This is due to the magnitude of the signal of change relative to the often-large interannual-to-decadal variability in these quantities. Thus, while satellite ocean colour products provide regular and global coverage, even these data will require additional decades of observations before the signal of climate change is obvious over large regions of the ocean.
