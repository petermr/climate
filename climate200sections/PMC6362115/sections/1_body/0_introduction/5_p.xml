 <sub>RS</sub> (ocean colour). In this paper, we specifically address how strong the climate change signal will be in ocean colour and the different factors that affect it. We determine which optical property is likely to respond most rapidly to climate change, and thus should be the focus of efforts to detect robust climate-driven trends in satellite ocean colour records. The model also allows for estimating Chl-a from the model
