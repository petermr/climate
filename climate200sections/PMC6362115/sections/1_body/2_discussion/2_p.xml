<p id="Par36">We find that the most widely used indicator of marine phytoplankton, Chl-a, does not evince rapidly detectable long-term trends, due to large natural variability. Instead, our study suggests that individual wavebands of colour (here the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub>) have a more readily detectable climate change trend, over a greater proportion of the ocean, than the hue angle, Chl-a, CDOM or detrital matter. For instance, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> centred at 500 nm has a significant trend by 2100 over 63% of the ocean, compared to only 31% of the ocean for Chl-a. Reflectance has lower natural variability than Chl-a and other in-water properties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> also integrates the alterations of all the optically important constituents. These two aspects lead reflectance to be a more sensitive indicator of change than any single constituent by itself. Changes to reflectance might provide the earliest alert from ocean colour satellites of climate change impacts on the bulk marine ecosystem. However, the precision and drift in ocean colour sensors will need to be sufficiently low to capture these signals (trends generally &lt;1% per decade).
