<p id="Par38">We find that the optically important water constituents do not all alter in the same manner. For instance, CDOM is increasingly bleached with higher stratification and community shifts alter the relative amount of detrital matter. The shifts in the relative importance of the optical constituents alter the spectral makeup of the water leaving irradiance and the ocean colour. Such a change will pose a problem to any of the ocean colour products that utilize in situ knowledge of the ocean’s current optical make up. We show that Chl-a derived from

 <sub>RS</sub> with a reflectance ratio algorithm developed for the current day does not capture the correct trends over the course of the 21st century. New algorithm development need to keep the ocean’s altering optical properties in mind. Shifts in optical properties should be taken into account when studying trends in Chl-a and productivity in the real ocean, even in the near term. Such studies might consider time-varying algorithms. Techniques that separately estimate the different water constituents
