<p id="Par41">Our results thus suggest several focus areas important for monitoring the response of ocean productivity to climate change: maintaining ocean colour sensor compatibility and long term stability, particularly in the 490â€‰nm waveband; maintaining long-term in situ time-series of plankton community, e.g. the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey and repeat stations (e.g. HOT, BATS); reducing uncertainties in satellite-derived phytoplankton community structure estimates.</p>
