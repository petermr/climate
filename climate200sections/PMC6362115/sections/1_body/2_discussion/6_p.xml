<p id="Par40">The estimates of bulk ocean phytoplankton, such as Chl-a, commonly used in assessing the influence of both natural variability and climate change on marine ecosystems mask more nuanced changes to the community structure and in turn their impact on other optically important constituents of the ocean. Although overall ecosystem productivity may change more slowly, relatively rapid changes to phytoplankton community structure may have significant knock-on effects for the fecundity and composition of the local higher trophic level community.</p>
