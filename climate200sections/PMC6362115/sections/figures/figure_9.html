 <caption> Trends and time of emergence. Model linear trend (%/year) for a actual Chl-a, and b remotely sensed reflectance at 475 nm; and time of emergence of trend for c Chl-a, and d R RS at 475 m. A generalized least squares (GLS) fit was used to quantify the trends. Only regions with statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05) trends over the 21st century and that were largely ice-free in the current day (as model R RS are only valid for such regions) are shown. The symbols (+,o) indicate two locations highlighted in Fig.  8 </caption>
