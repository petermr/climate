 <caption> Relative magnitude of interannual variability. Global median of the ratio of the annual composite temporal standard deviation to the 18 year mean composite for a satellite derived Chl-a (dChl), actual Chl-a (Chl), detrital matter (det) and CDOM; and for b remotely sensed reflectance. Blue indicates model output, red for OC-CCI products, and black for the model interpolated to the OC-CCI wavebands. The OC-CCI reflectances are at 412, 443, 490, 510, 555, 670 nm. See Supplementary Fig.  4 for spatial patterns of relative magnitude or both model of OC-CCI products </caption>
