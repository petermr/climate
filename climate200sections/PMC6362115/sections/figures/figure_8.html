 <caption> Time series of changes in two locations. a, b are in the North Atlantic, indicated by circle in Fig.  4. c, d are in North Pacific, indicated by cross in Fig.  4. a and c show the changes in model actual Chl-a (black) and model Chl-a product derived from reflectance ratio (red); b, d show changes in R RS for 475 nm (dark blue) and 550 nm (light blue). Straight solid lines indicate the linear trend using generalized least squares (GLS), the dashed horizontal lines indicate plus and minus two standard deviations (STD) of the interannual variability from 1998 to 2015, and the vertical dashed line shows the time of emergence (trend &gt; twice the STD) </caption>
