 <caption> Three leading modes governing simulated summer SAT anomalies in d4PDF and their time series. ( a– c) Regression patterns of JJA-averaged SAT (shading), 500 hPa geopotential height (contours: 5 m intervals), and wind vectors (m s −1) against the normalised score from each ensemble member (grey lines in d– f) for ( a) first, ( b) second, and ( c) third PCs. Wind speeds &lt;0.5 m s −1 are omitted. ( d– f) Interannual variations of the normalised scores (grey) and their ensemble averages (black). Blue and green lines in ( d) represent JJA means of sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean and northern hemispheric SAT, respectively. The sea ice area is presented as a percentage change relative to the 1951–2010 average. </caption>
