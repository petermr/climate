 <caption> Relationship between summer leading SAT modes and spring soil moisture. ( a, c) Probability that score of ( a) PC2 and ( c) PC3 is positive computed for each 1.0 kg m −2 interval bin of soil moisture anomalies (bars). Blue and red crosses indicate the probability computed for samples whose deviations from the ensemble average are greater than one and two times the standard deviation, respectively. ( b, d) Scatter plots between the soil moisture anomaly in May averaged over 50°–70°N, 50°–70°E (see Fig.  3), and scores of ( b) second and ( d) third PCs for 6,000 samples. The soil moisture anomaly was computed with respect to the ensemble averages. Blue and red lines in ( b) and ( d) represent average plus/minus one and two times the standard deviation, respectively. </caption>
