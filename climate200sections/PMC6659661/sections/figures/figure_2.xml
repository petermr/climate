  <p>Three leading modes governing simulated summer SAT anomalies in d4PDF and their time series. (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) Regression patterns of JJA-averaged SAT (shading), 500 hPa geopotential height (contours: 5 m intervals), and wind vectors (m s
   <sup>−1</sup>) against the normalised score from each ensemble member (grey lines in 
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) for (
   <bold>a</bold>) first, (
   <bold>b</bold>) second, and (
   <bold>c</bold>) third PCs. Wind speeds &lt;0.5 m s
   <sup>−1</sup> are omitted. (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) Interannual variations of the normalised scores (grey) and their ensemble averages (black). Blue and green lines in (
   <bold>d</bold>) represent JJA means of sea ice area in the Arctic Ocean and northern hemispheric SAT, respectively. The sea ice area is presented as a percentage change relative to the 1951–2010 average.
