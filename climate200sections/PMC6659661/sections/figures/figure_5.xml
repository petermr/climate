  <p>Seasonal variations of snow water equivalent and soil moisture associated with internal forcing. Monthly evolution of snow water equivalent (Left) and surface soil moisture (Right) anomalies reconstructed based on a linear combination of regression patterns for PC2 and PC3 (Methods) derived from d4PDF. The grey shading represents the area where climatological snow cover fraction is &lt;0.1. Soil moisture in 0–10 cm depth is presented. The box indicates the area (50°–70°N, 50°–70°E) for statistical analysis in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The anomaly indicates the deviation from the 6,000 year average (60 years by 100 members).
