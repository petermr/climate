<p id="Par2">Social awareness of abnormal weather is growing, particularly regarding the adverse effects of heat waves and droughts. Despite substantial efforts intended to mitigate climate change, the potential for the occurrence of extreme hot events is projected to increase in the future

 </sup>. Over northern Eurasia, the difference in summer surface air temperature (SAT) between the 2000s and the 1980s shows a distinct spatial contrast, forming a continental-wide tripole pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Two regions with prominent SAT increases are around the Eastern European Plain and Central Siberia–Mongolia, in contrast to weak SAT changes around the West Siberian Plain. This tripole pattern has been recognised in many studies both in terms of summer mean SAT

 </sup>. However, questions remain regarding the drivers of both the recent change in summer SAT and the occurrence of extreme hot events on a regional scale. Here, we examine the leading factors that alter summer SAT over northern Eurasia. We analyse a dataset derived from a 100-member ensemble experiment called the “database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change”
