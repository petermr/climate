<p id="Par9">The tripole pattern in summer SAT trend is characterised by internal processes involved in the coupled land–atmosphere system. Therefore, multi-GCM averaging or ensemble averaging of model projections might smooth the spatial variability of summer SAT. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, the wave train-like SAT change in d4PDF disappears due to the ensemble average. It is likely that future change in regional extreme hot events will exceed future projections based on multi-model ensemble averages. Closer monitoring of land surface conditions will be necessary to produce accurate projections of future change in summer SAT. We found that land surface anomalies in spring modulate the likelihood of summer SAT patterns over northern Eurasia. Therefore, our findings can improve the seasonal predictability of abnormal weather in the Eurasian summer.
