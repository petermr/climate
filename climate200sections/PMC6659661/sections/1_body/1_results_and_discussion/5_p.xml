<p id="Par7">Soil moisture in May over the Western Siberian Plain (50°–70°N, 50°–70°E) correlates weakly with the PC2 (r = 0.11) and PC3 (r = 0.17) scores (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). For both PC2 and PC3, the share of samples with positive scores increases with the soil moisture anomaly. The soil moisture anomaly modulates the diabatic heating of the atmosphere, which helps initiate the quasi-stationary wave

 </sup>. Through the positive feedback of land–atmosphere interactions, the wet soil and low SAT anomalies evolve simultaneously under the low pressure anomaly. The strong dependency of the sign of the PCs on the soil moisture anomaly is obvious for samples with large magnitude scores (exceeding one and two times the standard deviation). This indicates that strong land-to-atmosphere feedback is essential for the maintenance of substantial wave propagation over northern Eurasia. Resonance of PC2 and PC3 with positive sign, which accounts for the recent summer SAT change, is more likely to occur with increasing soil moisture around the Western Siberian Plain in May (Supplementary Fig.
