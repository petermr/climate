<p id="Par6">To understand the processes underlying the recent SAT change, key factors that determine a phase of the wave train pattern are investigated. While many previous studies have emphasised the role of North Atlantic SST in initiating trans-Eurasian teleconnection patterns

 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows combined regression patterns of surface anomalies with respect to the PC2 and PC3 scores (Methods), which represent surface anomalies associated with internal forcing. During the preceding winter, high values of snow water equivalent extend around the Western Siberian Plain, which indicate large amounts of water are supplied to the soil layers during the spring snowmelt. Wetter soil starts to emerge in May when the snow melt is finished in the mid-latitude areas. A low 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly develops in May over the Western Siberian Plain where the underlying soil is wet (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Positive feedback between soil moisture and the atmosphere further intensifies the positive soil moisture anomaly in combination with the intensified mid-tropospheric low pressure anomaly. The wave train pattern, which resembles the decadal SAT change, develops in June. These results provide evidence supporting earlier studies that have claimed the Arctic winter climate influences mid-latitude summer climate
