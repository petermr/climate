<p id="Par12">The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was conducted over 22°–90°N, 0°–180°E. For the computation of eigenvectors, a variance-covariance matrix was used. Before the EOF analysis, the d4PDF data was re-gridded from the original 60 km resolution to 240 km. For d4PDF, 6,000 snapshots (60 years, 100 ensemble members) of JJA-averaged SAT were analysed, and the normalised PC scores for the 6,000 snapshots were arranged on the time axis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The EOF analysis presented in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> was based on the detrended SAT in which the deviation of JJA-averaged SAT of each member with respect to the ensemble average was used. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, simulated SAT differences between the 1980s and the 2000s for each ensemble member (n = 100) were analysed. For the EOF analysis using the JRA-55 dataset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we used the period of 1958–2017.
