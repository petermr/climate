The experiment was performed for the period 1951–2010 using MRI-AGCM3.2 (Meteorological Research Institute AGCM version 3.2)

 </sup> with TL319 resolution, which approximately corresponds to 60 km resolution. To constrain the model, historical SST, sea ice concentration, and sea ice thickness information was used. The ensemble members were also generated by numerical integration over the same period but with perturbed initial conditions and SST, taking account of analysis error in the observed SST estimates. In addition, concentrations of greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols were used for external forcing. Further detailed specifications are available in the dataset description
