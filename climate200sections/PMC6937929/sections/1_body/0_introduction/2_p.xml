<p id="Par16">Several studies have reported that two important AGI, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, have seasonal variability and may therefore be affected by climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Extreme precipitation events have been implicated in several waterborne AGI outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and in sporadic AGI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Extreme precipitation may increase pathogen transfer from environmental reservoirs (e.g. animal manure) into surface water either directly, by increasing stream discharge, which increases turbidity and promotes the re-suspension of infectious cysts/oocysts from river sediments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], or indirectly, by increasing overland runoff into water systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such increases in water turbidity can reduce the efficacy of drinking water treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Ascertaining the vulnerability of drinking water systems to extreme weather events in the present and the future is necessary for climate change adaptation approaches to protect public health.
