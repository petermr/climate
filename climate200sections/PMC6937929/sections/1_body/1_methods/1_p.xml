<p id="Par18">Estimation of the future impact of climate change on the risk of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis required two stages:1) Characterization of the exposure-outcome relationship between precipitation and disease through analysis of historical data (1997–2009) using distributed lag non-linear Poisson regression models; and 2) projection of the exposure-outcome relationship to future periods (2020–2099) using climate model predictions to derive expected annual numbers of cases under various climate change scenarios. The details of Stage 1 were described previously [
