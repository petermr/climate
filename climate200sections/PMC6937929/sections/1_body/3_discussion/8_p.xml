<p id="Par36">In this study, we developed a modeling framework that can be used with available downscaled precipitation projections to provide empirical evidence of how precipitation is likely to change and affect the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in the absence of sophisticated filtration. Given that downscaled future climate projections are readily available for Canada from PCIC, Ouranos (Quebec), USA (Scripps Institute) and other jurisdictions, a modeling framework such as ours can help understand the risk future climate poses to health through drinking water systems such that possible mitigation strategies can be implemented. We have designed an open-access software tool named ImpactR for the Public Health Agency of Canada to enable such estimation for those with access to local disease registries. ImpactR, enables calculation of future waterborne illness disease rates, then using 1/12 degree (~â€‰6 X 10 km) precipitation projections from PCIC to estimate future rates. Model coefficients and covariates selected in Stage 1 may require new calibration should the model be applied in climate regimes dissimilar to Metro Vancouver to account for contextual variations in local precipitation, case counts, and turbidity. The tool is available here:
