<p id="Par30">The results from this study indicate that extreme precipitation will become more common in the future in Metro Vancouver. This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes for the region [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since these extreme weather events contribute to water contamination through environmental factors such as increased turbidity, effective adaptation strategies that include turbidity control with filtration are needed to reduce water system vulnerability. Many medium to small-scale drinking water systems are operated with limited resources and are often unfiltered with poor infrastructure. These may be particularly at risk from extreme weather events [

If water treatment mitigation measures had not been implemented for Metro Vancouver as they were between 2010 and 2015, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis would likely increase overall between the 1990s to the 2080s driven primarily by expected changes in precipitation and increase in the population-attributable-risk. Within this overall annual increase, more cases would be expected from October to March and fewer would be expected from May to August [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Since 2009 the DWS for Metro Vancouver has had staged increases in the proportion of filtered finished water beginning with the Seymour Reservoir, followed by the connection of the Capilano Reservoir water to Seymour Capiliano filtration plant in 2014. The Coquitlam Reservoir, the third source for the system, is unfiltered relying upon ozonation as pre-treatment, UV (added in 2014 to enhance treatment), chlorine and pH control for treatment. Though it varies, usually about half of Metro Vancouverâ€™s finished water is filtered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We would expect these interventions have reduced the effect size seen between 1997 and 2009, but because turbidity remains a feature of source water from surface sources, we would expect the relationship between extreme rain events and waterborne disease risk to remain.
