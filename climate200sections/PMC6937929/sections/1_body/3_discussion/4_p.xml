<p id="Par32">Our final model, built on historical data, did not include temperature since this was not a significant factor controlling cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in the historical period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While temperature has consistently been associated with bacterial acute gastrointestinal illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], such a link with cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis is less clear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The model does however account for seasonal variation by including month as a factor in the model which acts as a proxy for temperature. Summer drought may increase the risk of waterborne diseases due to concentration of pathogens that are then washed into a DWS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], a phenomenon also observed in the lagged response of disease to precipitation in the present study. In the future very high temperatures and the risk of drought in the summer may lead to a muted summer decrease compared with the model we developed.
