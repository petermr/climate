<p id="Par33">The estimated additional number of waterborne disease cases reported in the future is relatively small (approximately 91 more cases per year). However, it is estimated that less than 3% of such cases are currently reported to public health authorities (1 out of 48.5 and 40.7 cases of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. If this holds for our projections, then between 3703 to 4414 additional cases per year could be attributed to climate change. Additionally, for the precipitation estimates sensitivity is less than specificity, so our disease estimates likely represent a lower-bound since we are necessarily conservative in the estimate of extreme rain events.
