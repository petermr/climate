<p id="Par26">In the absence of the additional water filtration which was installed, the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis was projected to increase in the future in association with the projected changes in precipitation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Across the twelve models, the combined incidence relative to 1970–2000 mean baseline increased by an average of 6% in the 2020s, 8% in the 2040s, 12% in the 2060s and 16% in the 2080s. Compared to the historical average of 558 cases per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], this corresponds to an expected 591 cases per year in the 2020s (ensemble range: 559–627) to 649 cases per year in the 2080s (ensemble range: 613 to 694). Differences in magnitude of climate projections between models occur due to both natural climate variability and model construction and uncertainty; each model simulation can represent different “phases” of climate variability which can be larger than the structural difference between models. Some climate model projections consistently resulted in either higher or lower changes in disease incidence. In our AGI model the projected case count increases ranged from 10 to 24% by the 2080’s relative to the historical period. To reduce the influence of these potential outliers in individual runs we removed the upper and lower 10% of model values at each year before averaging the remaining eight projections to arrive at our final annual estimate.
