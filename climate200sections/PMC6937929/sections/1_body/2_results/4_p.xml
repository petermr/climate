<p id="Par28">The retrospective model validation indicated a reasonable model fit with mean absolute error of ~ 1 case per week. Diagnostic plots showed no gross indicators of model misspecification (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Using the observed Environment Canada (EC) weather station data as the ‘gold standard’ for weekly precipitation, we compared the weekly cumulative precipitation for EC with the PCIC interpolated precipitation for the grid containing the EC weather station. This generated a specificity (true negative/(false positive + true negative)) for PCIC data to detect observed extremes of precipitation of 97% while the sensitivity was 75% ((true positive/(true positive + false negative)).
