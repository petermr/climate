<p id="Par37">Without the filtration added in 2010â€“2015, the risk of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis would have been expected to increase with climate change, particularly precipitation changes, in our study area. These findings add to the growing evidence regarding the need to prepare, manage and become resilient to climate change-related risks. Although uncertainties remain in modelling the host-pathogen-interactions, we present a framework to study the future impact of water-borne disease illness using downscaled climate data that is suitable for local conditions. Further research is necessary to incorporate multiple exposure pathways, health outcomes and water system specific drivers to understand the present and future waterborne risks more clearly.</p>
