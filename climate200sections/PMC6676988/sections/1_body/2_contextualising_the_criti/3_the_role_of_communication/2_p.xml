<p>Participation, a central tenet in development planning discourses, refers to the inclusion of those who are affected or who can affect a decision (Hobley 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Rowe and Frewer (
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) conceptualise participation from a two-way flow of communication in terms of information dissemination to passive participants and gathering information from participants. The rationale for participation in natural resources management, however, is largely informed by local resistance to state control of natural resources and need to address tragedy of the commons arguments (Bixler et al.
