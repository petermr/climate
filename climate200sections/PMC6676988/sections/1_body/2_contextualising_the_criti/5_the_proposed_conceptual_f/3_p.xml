<p>Adaptation-Mitigation-Sustainable Development (AMSD) frameworks are an integral part of wider development goals in transition to sustainability and critical in policy formulation, decision-making, governance and behavioural development (Bizikova, Robinson &amp; Cohen 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). AMSD includes the creation of local implementation pathways that increase opportunities for social learning processes and capacities for effective adaptation and mitigation (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). As the status of soil salinity as well as its temporal variation can be used as an indicator in the monitoring of degradation risks and as a sustainability indicator (Metternicht &amp; Zinck 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), salinity levels can serve as an indicator of maladaptation in AMSD frameworks.
