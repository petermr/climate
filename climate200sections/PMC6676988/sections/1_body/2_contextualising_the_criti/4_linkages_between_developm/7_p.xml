<p>Though risk communication can be used in creating awareness about risks, it has some drawbacks, such as linearity that renders them ineffective (Evans et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As the communication for development is concerned with re-engineering diffusion research into a process of innovation, identifying the problem, stakeholder mapping, stakeholder engagement, critical evaluations and reviews as well as addressing the social costs in a participatory manner are some of the prerequisites in re-engineering the process (Leeuwis 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We argue that communication for development lenses can be utilised in enhancing the robustness and utility of risk communication in adaptation planning.
