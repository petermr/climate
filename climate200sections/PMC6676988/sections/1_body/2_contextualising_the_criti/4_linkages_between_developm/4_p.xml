<p>The risk message model, the risk dialogue model, governability risk model and risk field communication model have been explored in detail by Wardman (
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The risk message model is about one-way provision of information about the nature of risks (Jaeger &amp; Renn 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In the risk message model, it is assumed that people communicate to convey information which may be used by others to enhance their understanding about a given risk. The model focuses on providing or disseminating information about risks which does not necessarily lead to greater understanding (Wardman 
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Further, it does not consider the effect of complex social networks on expectations, commitment and understanding and co-construction of risk messages and meanings (Jaeger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Horlick-Jones 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The mechanistic nature of risk message model (sender–receiver model without engagement or interaction) limits participation thus excluding knowledge from risk message recipients. Such asymmetry reduces the likelihood of the recipient accepting or adopting a particular risk proposition or viewpoints advanced by the experts (O’Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In addressing such drawbacks, risk dialogue, risk governability and risk field model have been suggested.
