<p>Risk dialogue model seeks to promote participation and inter-subjectivity with an objective of overcoming linearity weaknesses associated with risk message model (Jovchelovitch 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Hence, it utilises a two-way communication model to incorporate interests of all actors involved in a particular risk issue. Under the model, the actors are regarded equally and treated like partners. The approach nurtures responsibility and allows for debates as well as collaborative interaction in risk management (Fischhoff 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The inter-subjective understanding of risk allows for consensus building between citizens (Jovchelovitch
