<p>Maladaptation is underlying risk in climate change action (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>). Hence, there is a need to investigate policies, plans and programmes in terms of risks and opportunities critical in sustainable development agenda. Underlying risks refer generally to the socio-economic and environmental factors that are the primary causes of a disaster. Individual and societal stocks of knowledge, attitudes, skills and the consequent risk behaviour are among the key factors that influence vulnerability (Satya 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Nuanced against the urgency for adaptation action in an environment of cognitive failure, the critical question is on who has the power to act or the ‘agency’ in safeguarding public good (interests). To answer the question requires an understanding of how hazards (trigger events), vulnerability and capacity interact. Models for such analysis are provided by Mimura et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and Turner et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). In the current article, we contextualise the risks of salinisation from irrigation among small-scale farmers.
