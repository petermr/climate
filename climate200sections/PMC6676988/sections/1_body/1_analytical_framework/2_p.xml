<p>Proactive engagement of stakeholders in early phases of disaster risk management is a requisite for resilient societies and built environment against disasters (Mojtahedi &amp; Oo 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). As adaptation is a continuous stream of activities, actions, decisions and attitudes that inform all aspects of life that reflect existing social norms (Nelson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), it is important to frame it from social system lenses, the structure of which is provided by various individuals and groups of which it is composed (Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). This is critical because social relations influence expectations, commitment and understanding of risks by individuals and communities (Kasperson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). As the functional element within a social system is the potential or actual behaviour of the individual and the collectives in a social system in terms of knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, there has been a shift from diffusion and transfer of technologies to a broader understanding of how to involve multi-stakeholders through communication activities (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This could be extended to holistic approaches that apply feedback loops between the climate system, the human system and ecosystems in assessment of adaptation planning (David &amp; Elise 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Effective communication of the risks is thus posited to play an important role in smallholder farmersâ€™ adaptation to climate change.
