<p>The characteristics that impact risk perception and behaviour and the degree of dread associated with the risk vary with the public’s familiarity with the risk (Slovic 
 <xref rid="CIT0074" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). As hazards interact with psychological, social and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate individual and social perception of risk and shape risk behaviour (Renn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), debates concerning societal values and world views require good understanding of the social context on which risk management decisions are made (OECD 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). More critical is the observation that collective action influences individual action in climate change risk management (David &amp; Elise 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). As individual and social characteristics, in particular risk perception, interact with underlying values to form subjective and mutable limits to adaptation that currently hinder society’s ability to act, it could preclude adaptation at societal scales (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). This creates the need for integration of social learning and communication concepts in adaptation planning (Servaes &amp; Lie
