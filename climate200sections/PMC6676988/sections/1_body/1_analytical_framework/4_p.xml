<p>Under risk perception normalisation theory (Becker, Ronan &amp; McClure 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), people tend to think that they are not at risk from an existing risk. Perceptions of being safe may, however, change to perceptions of being at risk immediately after a disaster by providing a window of opportunity to motivate preparedness and mitigation. The impact of seeing what other people have performed to prepare and mitigate a disaster is a stronger motivation for taking action than receiving information about the need to take action (Mileti &amp; Darlington 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Diffusion of technology models (Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) could be used in partly explaining such observation. Diffusion innovation theory holds that observability is critical to adoption processes. In this way, people can bring direct, indirect and vicarious experiences to bear on their risk assessments and preparedness decision-making (Becker et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
