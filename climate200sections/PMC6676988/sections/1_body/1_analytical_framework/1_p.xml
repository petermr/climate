<p>Stakeholder attributes such as agency play essential role in the proactive and reactive approaches to disaster risk management (Mojtahedi &amp; Oo 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This includes factors such as perception of risk, habit, social status and age which operate at individual and consequently collective action decision-making levels (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Cognition or knowledge about risks is thus critical in risk reduction planning. Accordingly, approaches in climate change action need to integrate indigenous knowledge with latest scientific insights, address multiple stressors and trade-offs, build adaptive management capacity as well as focus on information management, sustainability, monitoring and evaluation of risks (DEA

 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, individual adaptation hinges on whether an impact, anticipated or experienced, is perceived as a risk and whether it should (and could) be acted upon through adaptation policies, or is constrained by inertia and cultures of risk denial (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). As existing models are inadequate for effective public participation (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), there is need for a hybrid climate change communication model that integrates bottom-up and top-down processes, embraces information and communication technologies (ICTs), empowers local communities and nurtures collective action (Evans et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
