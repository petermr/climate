<p>While the inherent post-disaster emergency relief planning approach that is implicit in the risk normalisation bias theory (Becker et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) is relevant in reinforcing positive risk behaviour, it stands at crossroad with proactive approaches advocated by the disaster risk reduction paradigm. It is also at variance with precautionary principles in the management of environmental risks. According to the isolation paradox (Baumol 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), individuals are willing to make a sacrifice on their present consumption (through abatement of ecological degradation risks) to benefit future generations if others do so. However, under the free rider analogy (Hardin 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>), individuals expect benefits from other peopleâ€™s abatement initiatives, yet they are unwilling to do the same. As the agency of safeguarding and enforcing public interest through abatement falls on the government enforcement and compliance systems and institutions (Rose
