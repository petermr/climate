<p>Most of the natural resource management technologies, such as irrigation, have both larger spatial scales and longer time horizon impacts or externalities (Knox, Meinzen-dick &amp; Hazell 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Failure to recognise and/or discount such threats constitutes cognitive failure and imposes long-term social costs on society (Coase 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>). The socio-ecological dilemma is rooted in isolation paradox (Baumol 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and free rider (Hardin 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>) analogies. This is particularly critical in planning adaptation to climate change because existence of strong environmental and conservation polices and legislation in many countries does not necessarily imply effective implementation and enforcement (Shivakoti, Ullah &amp; Pradhan 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Designing cost-effective collective action strategies required for abatement of environmental externalities inherent in climate change action is thus a development planning challenge.
