<p>Though sustainable development thinking has benefitted immensely from a number of conceptual frameworks such as the nexus model (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and environment-livelihood sustainability (Biggs et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) models, existence of autonomous adaptation and maladaptation (Adger, Arnell &amp; Tompkins 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2010a</xref>) and attendant ecological risks suggest failure by policy makers, farmers and community of practice to recognise the underlying drivers of risks in adaptation planning. Maladaptation occurs when adaptation action or investment taken to avoid or reduce climate change impacts increases vulnerability to other risks that impact adversely on, or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups (Barnett &amp; O’Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Maladaptation thus imposes negative externalities on third parties and ecosystems. Accordingly, meaningful integration against maladaptation is a challenging task in adaptation planning (Mimura et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). An externality is present when the production or consumption activities of one economic agent have direct, non-price-mediated effects on the production or consumption activities of another economic agent (Coase 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>).
