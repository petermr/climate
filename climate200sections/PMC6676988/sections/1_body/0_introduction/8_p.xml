<p>Dissemination of information or successful risk communication increases people’s knowledge and motivates the public and households to prepare and mitigate disasters (Dennis et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Though risk communication has potential in the raising awareness about environmental and health risks, it has several limitations. Such limitations include risk of information overload (O’Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and a high likelihood of targeted people failing to pay attention (Renn 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Further, the linearity in the coding, transmission and decoding can lead to substantial disengagement and the generation of meaning of the disseminated risk messages, distortion and redundancy (Jaeger &amp; Renn 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The utility of risk communication in the construction of collective knowledge and attitudes towards climate change, a long-term sustained crisis, is thus debatable (Servaes &amp; Lie 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Linearity or one-way communication is a form of passive participation that limits the extent to which a community or individuals can influence a programme (Arnstein 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Evans et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). One-way communication depresses learning and alienates intended recipients of communication (Fischhoff 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).
