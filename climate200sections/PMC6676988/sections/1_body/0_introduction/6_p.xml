<p>Mitigation of disasters requires active public participation and strong political mobilisation, which may be achieved through assessment of community perceptions, experiences and responses to disasters (Wisner, Blaikie &amp; Davis

 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). As the extent to which opinions and interests of stakeholders are taken into account are important in sustainability discourses (Del Rio &amp; Burguillo 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), we attempt to explore how cognitive dissonance of various actors, such as farmers, extension workers and policy makers in adaptation planning, can be addressed.
