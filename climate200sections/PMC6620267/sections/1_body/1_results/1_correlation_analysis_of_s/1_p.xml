<p id="Par7">THMs in potable water from the five case study Scottish DWTPs described in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> in Supplementary Information showed strong seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The peak THM concentrations measured in September were on average more than twice as high as the minima measured in March. Our monthly monitoring of water quality at the five case study sites in Scotland comprised 42 parameters of potable water quality and 38 parameters of raw water quality. However, amongst the many parameters monitored (summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> &amp; S3 in Supporting Information), only the monthly averages of water temperature, and various indicators of the water organic carbon content (TOC, HPI and TPI, transmission at UV wavelengths 254 and 270 nm) had statistically significant Pearson correlations (p &lt; 0.05) with the monthly averages of total THMs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The significant correlation between water temperature and TOC (0.689, p &lt; 0.05) motivated us to investigate the effect of each factor on THMs separately, as described below, to assure their relationships with THMs were not spurious. Observed correlations were generally strongest for chloroform, and then became weaker and/or statistically insignificant with increased bromination of the THMs. Average bromide concentrations in raw waters at case study sites varied from 19 to 173 mg/L, and from 8 to 81 mg/L in potable water. The THM speciation varied accordingly, with brominated THMs being more prevalent at higher bromide concentration, as would be expected

 </sup>. Further, there were very strong and significant positive correlations between potable and raw water temperature (r = 0.989, p &lt; 0.0001). Equally, there were statistically significant strong and positive correlations between potable and raw water TOC (r = 0.845, p = 0.0005 for unfiltered raw water TOC, r = 0.938, p &lt; 0.0001 for filtered raw water TOC, equivalent to DOC), showing similar seasonality for these parameters in raw and treated water. This is despite substantial TOC reductions during water treatment, by an average 87.0 ± 0.7%. We also analysed seasonal changes in indicators of organic carbon quality in potable water, such as the percentage of organic matter belonging to the hydrophobic organic fraction (HPO), the transphilic organic fraction (TPI), and the hydrophilic organic fraction (HPI). However, no clear seasonal trends in these indicators of organic carbon quality were apparent in potable water (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) that would correspond to the seasonality observed for the THMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and there were no statistically significant Pearson correlations between monthly averages of the percentage of TOC belonging to each of the HPO/TPI/HPI fraction and total THMs.
