<p id="Par16">The predicted increases in THM formation for the various scenarios ranged from 0 to 100%, with an increase of 39% being the mid-range scenario (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The effect of a warming climate on surface water DOC levels is the main contributor to this predicted increase for the mid-range scenario (33.5%), while the direct water temperature effect on THM formation accounts for 5.4%.
