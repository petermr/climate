<p id="Par8">In the months of March, June, September and December water samples were obtained from the five DWTPs to separately investigate, with controlled laboratory experiments, the effects of organic carbon concentration and temperature, and hypothetical changes in DOC quality between the months on THMs formation. The raw water from the case study sites was diluted to either 5 or 1 mg/L DOC concentrations (to create common chemical conditions for parallel experiments) before disinfection with a fixed amount of chlorine at a fixed temperature of either 5, 15, or 25 °C. The treated water from the case study sites sampled before the point of disinfection was diluted to 1 mg/L DOC concentration, if it exceeded this concentration level. By repeating these experiments in the months of March, June, September and December, the potential influence of seasonal changes in DOC composition on THM formation could be investigated.</p>
