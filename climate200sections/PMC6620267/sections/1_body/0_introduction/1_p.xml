 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. This becomes particularly evident in regions with extensive peatlands in drinking water catchments where warming effects have been related to increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, which then impacts water treatability in DWTPs
