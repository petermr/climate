<p id="Par6">We used correlation analysis and extensive monthly monitoring data from five full-scale DWTPs in Scotland to first firmly establish changing DOC and ambient temperature as the main causes for seasonality in THMs formation. We next used controlled laboratory experiments to investigate, for each correlation factor separately, how variations in water temperature and DOC concentration will influence THM formation. We then derived from the laboratory data a quantitative relationship between the changes in water temperature, water DOC and THMs formation, and validated this relationship with the monitoring data from the DWTPs. By combining the insights thus gained with climate change scenarios published in the literature, we were finally in a position to discuss the likely magnitude of future climate change impacts on THMs formation in DWTPs. While this work is particularly relevant for drinking water treatment in regions with extensive peatlands in drinking water catchments, the broader implications apply globally to DWTPs using chlorine for disinfection.</p>
