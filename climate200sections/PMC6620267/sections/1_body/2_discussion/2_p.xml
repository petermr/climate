<p id="Par18">To exclude the possibility that these correlations observed in full-scale water treatment data are spurious, we separately investigated, with controlled laboratory experiments, the effects of variations in organic carbon concentration and temperature, and potential seasonal changes in organic carbon quality on THMs formation. From the laboratory test results it was evident that the parameters water temperature and DOC both directly influence THMs formation, as more THMs were consistently formed for a fixed amount of DOC of the same origin, but at higher water temperature, or for a fixed water temperature, but at a higher DOC concentration of the same origin. The findings are in line with earlier literature reports of higher water temperature or higher DOC during disinfection enhancing the formation of by-products in water treatment plants

 </sup>. In addition, our study excluded from both, monitoring and laboratory data, seasonal DOC quality changes as a major cause for the seasonal variability in THMs, since the DOC quality indicators HPI, TPI and HPO, if expressed as % of DOC, were not correlated with total THMs in the monitoring data, and since in the laboratory experiments, THM formation per mg of DOC was similar for water sampled in different calendar months.
