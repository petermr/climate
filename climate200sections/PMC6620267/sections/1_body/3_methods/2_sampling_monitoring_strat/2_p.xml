<p id="Par26">The second sampling strategy collected samples quarterly in 5 L high density polyethylene containers with caps purchased from VWR, Poole, England. Samples were delivered to the School of Engineering (Newcastle University) where samples were filtered through glass fibre pre filters (Millipore, Cork, Ireland) to remove larger particulates and then through 0.45 µm polyamide membranes (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) to be stored at 4 °C until for further use. These samples were used for THMFP measurements.</p>
