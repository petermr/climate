<p id="Par28">Water solutions with DOC content of 1 mg/L or 5 mg/L (270 mL) where transferred into amber glass bottles with glass caps and buffered with 2.74 mL phosphate buffer solution (34 g KHPO
 <sub>4</sub> and 5.85 g NaOH in 250 mL deionised water) and immediately chlorinated with 1.4 mL of a 1000 mg/L sodium hypochlorite solution previously standardised with 0.1 M sodium thiosulphate according to APHA methods and filled to the brim with deionised water to prevent any oxygen from entering the reaction vessel. Each sample was prepared in triplicate and incubated at 5 °C, 15 °C and 25 °C. After seven days (+/−4 hours), THMs were liquid-liquid extracted and analyzed following a previously described method protocol (Werner 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2016).
