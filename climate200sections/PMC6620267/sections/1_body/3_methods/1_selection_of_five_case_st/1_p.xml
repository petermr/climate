<p id="Par24">Case study sites were selected from a total of 93 DWTP sites across Scotland to identify five representative sites. Cluster analysis was performed to achieve this objective using the K-means algorithm by R Studio free software (Integrated Development for R. R Studio, Inc., Boston, MA. Version: 3.3.1). Preliminary exploratory analysis of data involved the division of DWTP sizes into three categories: small, medium and large. Size was defined by applying a histogram of frequency for size (ML/day) using also R Studio software. Minimum size was allocated at 0.006 ML/day and maximum at 110 ML/day. Frequency plots showed that 47 of the DWTPs from the selected 93 sites (51.6%) were small ranging from 0.006 ML/day to 0.838 ML/day, 26 DWTPs (28.6%) were medium size ranging from 0.838 ML/day to 13.5 ML/day and 18 DWTPs (19.8%) were large ranging from 13.5 ML/day to 110 Ml/day. Twenty centroids were used for K-means with a maximum number of 100 iterations. The K groups were plotted against the following quality variables: total THMs (distribution and potable water), TOC (raw water, final potable and distribution networks), colour (raw water), chloride (distribution networks) and bromide (raw water) to determine outliers (anomalies). This approach selected a preliminary set of 21 DWTPs that were grouped per region from which the final selection of five case study sites was narrowed down according to accessibility, type of treatment (conventional coagulation and membrane filtration) and geographical location. The five sites are described in Table
