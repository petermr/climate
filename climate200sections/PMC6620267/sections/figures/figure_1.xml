  <p>Seasonality in (
   <bold>a</bold>) the average potable water quality, and (
   <bold>b</bold>) the average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) composition, expressed as % hydrophobic organic fraction (HPO), transphilic organic fraction (TPI) and hydrophilic organic fraction (HPO), in potable water of five Scottish water treatment plants. Error bars indicate the standard error (n = 5) for the monthly average, relative to the annual average, calculated for the case study sites. Annual average values were 9.66 °C for temperature, 1.08 mg/L for TOC, 43.93 mg/L for THMs, 40.1% for HPI, 18.6% for TPI and 41.3% for HPO.
