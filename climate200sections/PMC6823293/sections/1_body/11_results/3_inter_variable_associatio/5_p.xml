<p id="Par36">Consequently, a revised and simplified process model was estimated which excluded the interaction term between the experimental variables, as well as the direct effect of type of comment on 
 <italic>AGW</italic>. The revised model is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and was found to be associated with acceptable levels of model fit, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(17) = 45.93,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>F</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .964, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <italic>L</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .941, 
 <italic>RMSEA</italic>= .066, 
 <italic>SRMR</italic>= .052. All weights and correlations shown in the figure are significant. It can be seen that the type of post (TP) had a direct effect on 
 <italic>AGW</italic> (
 <italic>b</italic> = .16,
 <italic>β</italic> = .13,
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Thus, exposure to the scientific post was associated with greater levels of acceptance of the mainstream science, as already indicated by the corresponding main effect in the earlier ANOVA. A corresponding direct effect for type of comments (TC) was absent. However, both types of post, 
 <italic>b</italic> = .07,
 <italic>β</italic> = .05,
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and type of comment, 
 <italic>b</italic> = .09,
 <italic>β</italic> = .07,
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, had indirect effects on 
 <italic>AGW</italic> via the reflected reader consensus score. Thus, people’s acceptance of mainstream science was in part determined by their perception of how many other readers shared their view, and that perception in turn was influenced by our experimental design variables, namely the type of post and type of comments. The multiple 
 <italic>R</italic> associated with the model was .280 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Thus, 7.7% of the 
 <italic>AGW</italic> true score variance was accounted for by the direct effect of the type of comment variable and the indirect effects of both experimental variables.
