<p id="Par23">The five items probing climate attitudes were reverse-scored as appropriate (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for a description of all items) and then averaged to form a single composite score, called 
 <italic>AGW</italic> in the figures, that was used for the descriptive statistics. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows summary statistics and distributional information for all dependent variables across the four cells of the experimental design (panels a–e), and pairwise correlations between perceived reader consensus and acceptance of AGW for the four cells separately (panel f). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the cell means for the same set of dependent variables. Skewness and kurtosis for all measures were within ± 1 and there were no particularly outlying observations based on the interquartile range outlier detection rule (Hoaglin &amp; Iglewicz, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1987</xref>).
