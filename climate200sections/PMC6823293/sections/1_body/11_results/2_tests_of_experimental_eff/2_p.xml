<p id="Par24">The variables in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> were analyzed by frequentist as well as Bayesian techniques. We report the Bayesian analysis in the 
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>; here we present a series of 2 × 2 ANOVAs that explored the pattern in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Except where noted, the Bayesian analysis supported identical conclusions. For the item querying whether readers felt they were affected by blog comments (item 
 <italic>Unaffected</italic> in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), no effects reached significance, all 
 <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. The overall mean of this item also did not differ from the mid-point of the scale (
 <italic>M</italic> = 3.02, 
 <italic>t</italic>(392) &lt; 1), suggesting that participants were ambivalent about whether or not they were affected by others’ views and this ambivalence was invariant across all conditions.
