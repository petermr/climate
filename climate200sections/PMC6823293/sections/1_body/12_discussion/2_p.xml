<p id="Par38">Although our indirect effect was small in absolute magnitude, it may be of some practical significance when it is scaled up to the number of readers of scientific blogs (for other examples of the relevance of seemingly small effects, see Kahan &amp; Braman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2003</xref>). Specifically, the observed difference in perceived reader consensus between the two comment conditions involving the mainstream scientific post can be converted into the expected change in AGW acceptance based on the model in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. When this is done, contrarian comments are associated with a decline in acceptance of AGW by .13 on the items’ five-point scale.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> Given that 13.5% of our sample scored 3 on the AGW items, representing exact neutrality or complete indifference, the contrarian comments may suffice to nudge those respondents off the fence and towards rejection (i.e., a score below 3). Scaling up this effect to an audience of 1.5 million of popular blogs (Batts et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>), our results suggest that a large number of readers may be nudged towards rejection of climate science if they encounter a stream consisting of contrarian comments.
