<p id="Par43">There are, however, other theoretical frameworks that could be applied to the present results. For example, Walther, Woo Jang, and Edwards (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2018</xref>) examined the effects of user-generated online health advice within the heuristic–systematic model of social influence (Chaiken, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1980</xref>) and warranting theory (Walther, Heide, Hamel, &amp; Shulman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2009</xref>). Those models present a more nuanced and complex route to social influence; however, both subsume heuristics such as the effects of consensus explored here. Thus, within the heuristic-systematic model, a perceived consensus might trigger attitude change based on a “consensus implies correctness” heuristic (Todorov, Chaiken, &amp; Henderson, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2002</xref>). Within warrant theory, the presence of multiple seemingly independent sources can likewise provide epistemic warrant for the shared underlying opinion that is being articulated (Walther et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2018</xref>). Our results do not differentiate between those nuanced theoretical positions.
