<p id="Par44">We conclude by highlighting several open questions for researchers that our results helped bring into focus. First, how much dissent in a comment stream is required to disrupt the perception of a widespread consensus? Our streams were uniform in their orientation towards one position or the other, but in reality this rarely occurs. Might a single deviating comment be sufficient to disrupt consensus perception, as is suggested by the results of Koehler (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>) in a simulated “journalistic-balance” environment? Or might a pervasive consensus be perceived even when the share of supporting comments is at only 70%, as is suggested by some quantitative models of social influence (Muthukrishna et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>; Muthukrishna and Henrich, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>)? Second, can the effects of comments be moderated by information about hidden base rates (e.g., how many readers did the post have, relative to the number of comments; what was the proportion of “likes” and “dislikes” among readers who did not comment?). Third, to what extent do the self-report measures explored here translate into actual political behaviors, such as increased climate activism or disengagement with the issue. In light of current concerns about the erosion of truthful public and political discourse (Lewandowsky, Ecker, &amp; Cook, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>; Lewandowsky, Cook, &amp; Ecker, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>), those questions await urgent exploration.
