<p id="Par41">The fact that a small fraction of readers who leave comments—some of whom may even be “sock puppets” (Bu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>; Lewandowsky, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>)—can leverage public opinion about scientific issues must be of concern. This concern appears widely shared among Internet news services, although there is disagreement about the appropriate response. One response has been to discontinue commenting facilities altogether. Several large online news services have taken this step, including NPR (Jensen,

 <italic>TheConversation.com.</italic> which has entertained options such as a “community council” to provide moderation (

A further alternative that is being explored by a Norwegian site is the requirement that readers must pass a brief comprehension quiz before being permitted to post comments (
