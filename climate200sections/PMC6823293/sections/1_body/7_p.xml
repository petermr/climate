<p id="Par10">It is largely unknown whether anonymous blog comments provide effective social consensus information. We are aware of only two studies that examined this issue (Stavrositu &amp; Kim, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>; Winter &amp; Krämer, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>), both of which considered the effect of contrarian comments on readers’ responses to a scientific post. In both cases, comments that opposed the post decreased the impact of the scientific content by altering the perceived social norm among readers. Specifically, (Stavrositu &amp; Kim, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>) presented participants with a blog post relating to skin cancer, and found that behavioral intentions (e.g., to get screened for skin cancer) were a function of perceived consensual intentions among “other readers”, which in turn were (weakly) determined by the type of blog comments: When comments supported the tenor of the post—i.e., medical information about skin cancer—participants perceived this as indicative of a consensus among readers and reported their own intentions accordingly. However, when comments were dismissive of the content, the perception of a consensus and behavioral intentions were reduced. Along similar lines, Winter and Krämer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>) presented participants with a blog post that summarized the evidence for the adverse psychological effects of violent video games. The presence of dissenting comments was found to undermine support for the evidence presented in the post among participants who were not vested in the topic.
