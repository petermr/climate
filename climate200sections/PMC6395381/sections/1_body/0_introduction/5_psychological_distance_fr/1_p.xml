 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Spence et al. (2012)</xref> conducted the first study to systematically examine perceptions of psychological distance from climate change along all four dimensions proposed by CLT. In a survey of UK residents, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Spence et al. (2012)</xref> measured participants’ reported psychological distance from climate change: whether it was perceived to be spatially, temporally, socially or hypothetically distant from the self. They tested whether pro-environmental engagement is best predicted by abstract, distant perceptions of climate change, or concrete, close perceptions of climate change. This rationale was motivated by contrasting research suggesting that both types of perceptions and associated construals may predict pro-environmental engagement. Abstractness fosters a goal-centered mind-set and facilitates decision-making and planning for more distant, abstract events (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Trope and Liberman, 2010</xref>). Therefore, a psychologically distant and abstract mind-set may to lead to actions that adhere to one’s core beliefs (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liberman and Trope, 2008</xref>). Conversely, research also suggests that setting specific and concrete goals promotes behavioral engagement (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rabinovich et al., 2009</xref>). A concrete construal may promote a psychologically close view (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Trope and Liberman, 2010</xref>), one that fosters emotional and cognitive engagement with climate change (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Van Boven et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, making climate change psychologically close and concrete may make the consequences more tangible.
