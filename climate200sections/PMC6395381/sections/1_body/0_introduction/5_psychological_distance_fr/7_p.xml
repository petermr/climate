<p>A few studies that have examined psychological distance in contexts such as emotional intensity have found that psychological distance and construal level do not directly relate with one another (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). There is further evidence to suggest that construal level and psychological distance operate independently in the climate change context, and may constitute separate pathways to climate action. 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Devine-Wright (2013)</xref> argued that the relevance of local climate change effects does not necessarily negate the relevance of distant, global effects; it is possible to conceive of climate change affecting both local (close), and global (abstract) regions simultaneously, and to be concerned about both. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rabinovich et al. (2009)</xref> argue that it is possible, and even beneficial, to focus on a combination of close and abstract conceptions of climate change. In sum, it is important, both theoretically and practically, to study the unique contributions of psychological distance and construal level to climate change engagement.
