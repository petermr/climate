<p>To examine the effect of adding the BIF-E, we conducted the regression in two steps, adding BIF-E at the second step. The contribution of the variable to the model was small but significant (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> change = 0.021, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 7.109, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008). The step-wise model is shown in
