<p>Further, whereas the psychological distance items dealt specifically with climate change, the BIF items measured construal of “general” actions, but did not measure construal of “climate change” or “pro-environmental” actions specifically. In Study 1, we used two putative measures of construal level, namely the BIF (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Vallacher and Wegner, 1989</xref>) and the RCW scale (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pettigrew, 1958</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Krüger et al., 2014</xref>), with only the latter measuring environment-related items. Accordingly, it remains possible that the BIF might predict environmental behavior, and perceived psychological distance from climate change, if it contained items measuring construal of climate change directly. To test this possibility, a replication of Study 1 was conducted using an augmented version of the BIF that contained items assessing general and environmental construals.
