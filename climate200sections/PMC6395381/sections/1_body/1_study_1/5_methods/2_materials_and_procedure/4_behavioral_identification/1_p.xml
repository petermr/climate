<p>To verify the compatibility of psychological distance and construal level in the context of climate change, we used the behavioral identification form (BIF; 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Vallacher and Wegner, 1989</xref>), an established measure of construal level (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Soderberg et al., 2015</xref>). The BIF is a measure of cognitive processing, and assesses whether participants consider issues in an abstract, vague manner, or in a specific, concrete manner. The task involves a series of two-option forced-choice questions distinguishing whether participants construe actions concretely or abstractly. An example of an item would be whether the participant considers “Growing a garden” to be best described by “planting seeds” (concrete construal), or “getting fresh vegetables” (abstract construal).
