<p>An

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) to determine the minimum required sample size. Assuming an effect size of 0.29, based on previous work by 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Spence et al. (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brügger et al. (2015b)</xref>, a sample size of 111 would yield a power level of 0.99, at α = 0.05. A total of 218 (114 female) Australian adults recruited by Qualtrics–a survey company specializing in representative Internet surveys–participated in the study. The mean age was 47.35 years (range 18–84), and the median gross annual income bracket was $35,000–49,999 per year. Age, gender, and income groups approximated a representative distribution of Australia’s population, although high income earners were somewhat over-represented (
