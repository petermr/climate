<p>As discussed earlier, individual difference studies rarely measure both psychological distance and construal level and this problem is also true of the experimental literature on this topic. Additionally, those studies that have experimentally induced different levels of construal to selectively influence pro-environmental behaviors (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Shwom et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pahl, 2010</xref>) have not measured construal level or psychological distance post-manipulation. Accordingly, in these studies there was no way to verify whether pro-environmental actions have been encouraged by a change in psychological distance, or construal level, or both variables.
