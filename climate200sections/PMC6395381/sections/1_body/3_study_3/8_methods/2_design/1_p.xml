<p>The study adopted a 2 (construal level: concrete vs. abstract) Ã— 3 (time horizon: past vs. present vs. future) between-participants design. An additional control condition was included in which participants were not exposed to either the construal level or time horizon manipulations. Participants were allocated at random to the seven resulting between-participant conditions. The total number of participants in each of the seven conditions was as follows: control (
 <italic>N</italic> = 46), concrete/past (
 <italic>N</italic> = 47), concrete/present (
 <italic>N</italic> = 43), concrete/future (
 <italic>N</italic> = 47), abstract/past (
 <italic>N</italic> = 45), abstract/present (
 <italic>N</italic> = 48), and abstract/future (
 <italic>N</italic> = 44).
