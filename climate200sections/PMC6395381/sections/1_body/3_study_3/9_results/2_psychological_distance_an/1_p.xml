<p>The short-form of the PD1 scale (PD) had satisfactory internal consistency reliability (α = 0.72) and the reliability coefficients did not vary appreciably across the different conditions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows mean responses on the PD measure. To test whether mean scores differed between conditions, we dropped the control condition and conducted a 2 (construal level: concrete vs. abstract) × 3 (time horizon: past vs. present vs. future) ANOVA on the PD scores. There was no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 0.02, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.89, no significant main effect of time horizon, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 0.22, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.80, and no significant interaction between the two variables, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 0.60, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.55.
