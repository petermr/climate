<p>The RCW scale was largely only correlated with itself, although the RCW-G scale was weakly negatively correlated with the BIF-E. A detailed analysis by condition showed that this correlation was only significant in two conditions: concrete/future, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = -0.30, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, and abstract/future, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = -0.35, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02. In the concrete/future condition, the environmental subscale of RCW was also negatively correlated with the BIF-E, 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = -0.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02.
