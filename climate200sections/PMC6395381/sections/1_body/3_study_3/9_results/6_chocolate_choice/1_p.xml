 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> shows the chocolate choice data for the different conditions. These data were subjected to a multinomial logistic regression analysis, with chocolate choice (no chocolate vs. non-Fairtrade vs. Fairtrade) as the outcome measure (with “Fairtrade” as the reference category) and construal level, time horizon, and the construal level × time horizon interaction as predictors. A test of the model against a constant only model was not statistically significant, indicating that the predictors as a set did not reliably distinguish between people who chose no chocolate, a non-Fairtrade chocolate, and a Fairtrade chocolate, χ
 <sup>2</sup>(10) = 9.26,
