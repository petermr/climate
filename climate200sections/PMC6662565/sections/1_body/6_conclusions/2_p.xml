<p>While this study focuses on one single species, further work is needed to assess other taxa at the species, genus, and family levels to examine whether the relationship between δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> is consistent, and furthermore, generalizable. δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of individual fossil leaves (in particular of 
 <italic>Thuja</italic> leaves) cannot be used to reconstruct paleo-MAP as proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Kohn (2010)</xref>, but average δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of sites, as recorded in bulk soil organic matter, may allow us to predict precipitation ranges. Aboveground δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> is thought to translate directly into the isotopic value of soil carbon (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>org</sub>; 
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Arens, Jahren &amp; Amundson, 2000</xref>). Bulk soil organic matter (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>org</sub>) is the combination of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C of all decaying material from the ecosystem, with leaves especially abundant due to sheer volume. The average δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> value of all trees found in a certain region will be found in the soil; therefore, soil δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>org</sub> values could be more reflective of particular precipitation at time of deposition than δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values. Further studies could evaluate the reliability of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>org</sub> as a tool for MAP prediction and reconstruction.
