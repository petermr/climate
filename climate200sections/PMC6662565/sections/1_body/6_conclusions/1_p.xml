<p>Though δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> and Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values have been proposed as a proxy for [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] and MAP based on previous research, this natural-world, species-controlled study shows no indication of such relationships. Thus, the use of Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values to reconstruct MAP and [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] in the fossil record without taxonomic identification should be reconsidered. The relationship between δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values is more informative, and may provide a new proxy (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of 
 <italic>Thuja</italic>) for reconstructing paleo- δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> or may indicate a lag in plant adaptation to unprecedentedly rapid climate change. 
 <italic>Thuja</italic> extends up to 100 million years back to the Late Cretaceous, which makes this relationship potentially useful throughout the Cenozoic and into the Mesozoic era (
