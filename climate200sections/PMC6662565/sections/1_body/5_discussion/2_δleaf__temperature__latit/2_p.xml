<p>Because MAT and latitude are inherently related, we expected Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values to relate to latitude in the same way as when compared to MAT. As predicted, there was no relationship between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> and latitude. In order to ensure that these two codependent variables were treated as such, we ran a multiple linear regression, which gave a similarly low coefficient of determination (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.002) comparing actual Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values with Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values predicted using this regression. Thus, we are confident that both treated as independent and co-dependent variables, MAT and latitude do not play a role in variance of Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values.
