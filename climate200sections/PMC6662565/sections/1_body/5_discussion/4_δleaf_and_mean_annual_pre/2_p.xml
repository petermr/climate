<p>It is also possible that the predicted relationship between Î”

 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Diefendorf et al. (2010)</xref> is a result of incorporating sensitive plants. Indeed, other studies using rapidly growing, highly sensitive herbaceous angiosperms have found a relationship between water treatment and carbon isotope discrimination (
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Lomax et al., 2019</xref>). However, the fossil record is biased toward preserving less sensitive, often woody plants due to preservation potential as well as presence within the fossil record (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Looy et al., 2014</xref>); therefore, the utility of relationships based on highly sensitive plants may be muted in the fossil record.
