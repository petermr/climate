 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Giguère-Croteau et al., 2019</xref>). This increase in tree productivity was demonstrated in the results of free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) experiments as well; in northern USA mid-latitude forests with loblolly pines (
 <italic>P. taeda</italic>), FACE experiment results indicated that elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> induced increased carbon assimilation, resulting in increased carbon biomass, in woody tissues and increased %C of foliar storage as compared to trees grown under ambient CO
 <sub>2</sub> (

 <sub>2</sub>] related to Industrialization resulted in an increase in foliar %C with no change in %N (as source of N remains constant), and thus increased C:N ratios in some species (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Mervenne, 2015</xref>). In order to contextualize changes in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub>, this study examined coeval trends in leaf chemistry through elemental analysis of C and N (using N as a comparison point to see whether %C changes significantly with time).
