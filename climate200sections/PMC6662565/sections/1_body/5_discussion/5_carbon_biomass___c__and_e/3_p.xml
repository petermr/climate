<p>In fact, 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> specimens collected between 1804 and 2017 did not show changes in assimilation rates due to elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub>. C:N values of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> showed no response to changes over time (with increased [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]) or with atmospheric isotopic value (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">S2B</xref>). Though other organs in previous experiments responded to [CO
 <sub>2</sub>], leaves, which are instrumental in the photosynthetic process as they are the organs directly in-taking atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, do not. A better understanding of all plant organ behavior is imperative to defining and quantifying potential carbon sinks or plant chemistry responses to global change (
