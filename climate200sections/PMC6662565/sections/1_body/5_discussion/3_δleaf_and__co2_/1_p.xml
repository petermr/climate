<p>In this study we found no relationship between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> and [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] from 280 to 410 ppm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Fig. S4</xref>). It is possible that the relationship observed by 
 <xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr">Schubert &amp; Jahren (2012)</xref> exists only for idealized controlled growth chamber conditions and not in natural environments (
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Lomax et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, gymnosperms may respond more slowly than angiosperms to increases in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] due to their longer average lifespans and lack of senescence (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb, Pittermann &amp; Coomes, 2012</xref>). The changes in carbon assimilation as represented by increased carbon fractionation under short-term, ideal growth chamber conditions cannot be used to predict biological response to rapid changes in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]. In other words, plants, especially slow-growing woody plants, may not successfully adapt to anthropogenic changes of the present and future (
