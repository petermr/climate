<p>Complex nitrogen dynamics, as well as those of other macro- and micro-nutrients, may play a role in vital effects that relate ultimately to carbon assimilation and/or carbon isotope fractionation, but these changes are very difficult and complicated to reconstruct in the geologic record and thus were not investigated in this study (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Godfrey &amp; Glass, 2011</xref>). It is not possible to understand shifts in regional nitrogen availability fully even within the historical record: without soil cores collected and preserved from the same sites and times of leaf collection, it is not straightforward to consider anything other than nitrogen content. Given that no one collected soils at each historical site, we cannot address changes in nitrogen dynamics quantitatively. Furthermore, for geologic applications fossil leaves and corresponding paleosols (fossil soils) are not typically preserved together. In order to account for the potential range in nitrogen dynamics, we focus here on using many specimens from across a wide landscape of different land-uses and thus a wide range of potential nitrogen dynamics, but under known [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] conditions. To account for historical and geological limitations of reconstructing the nitrogen cycle, this study focuses instead on the relationship between systemic changes in C:N ratios in relation to δ
