 <italic>C
  <sub>a</sub>

 <sub>leaf</sub> values as plants adapt to increased [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] or subsequent regional climate changes, for example, systematic changes in local precipitation). Alternatively, Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of leaves may stay constant but show marked changes in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values corresponding to changes in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values if leaves are incorporating δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> into leaf tissues at a rate unaffected by other climate conditions.
