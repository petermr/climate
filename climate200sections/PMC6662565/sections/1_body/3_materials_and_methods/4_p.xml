<p>Five-point moving averages of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values were calculated to eliminate random noise caused by estimating older specimens’ exact collection dates (a result of long collecting expeditions and limited recording resources). We regressed isotope values against climate variables (MAT, MAP, δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> and annual [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]) to examine potential drivers of the δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values. We calculated the best-fit line using linear least squares regression to minimize the average distance between modeled 
 <italic>y</italic>-values and actual 
 <italic>y</italic>-values (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> and Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub>) and calculated coefficients of determination. We used 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> to determine predictive relationship between the given 
 <italic>x</italic>-variable and 
 <italic>y</italic>-variable. Additionally, we calculated 
 <italic>p</italic>-values using the 
 <italic>F</italic>-test to determine the chance of null hypothesis (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &gt; 0.05).
