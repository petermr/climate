 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr">Lowdon &amp; Dyck, 1974</xref>). Typically, more positive values are found in the winter (indicative of less isotopic discrimination) and more negative values occur in the summer (indicative of more discrimination). This effect strongest in arid and semiarid environments because they experience amplified seasonal temperature, precipitation, and evaporation effects (up to 4‰;
