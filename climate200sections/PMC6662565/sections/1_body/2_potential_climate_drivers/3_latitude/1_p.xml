<p>Latitude is expected to affect stomatal traits and therefore be related to carbon isotope fractionation due to its inverse relationship with light (specifically length of growing season and length of day) and temperature, and consequent effects on the maximum operating times for photosynthesis. A meta-analysis across 760 species in nine Chinese forest ecosystems showed a latitudinal variation in stomatal density and stomatal length at the community level (

 <sub>leaf</sub> values would be inversely related to latitude as well (
