<p>This study incorporates the natural shifts in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] concentrations as driven by fossil fuel combustion and other anthropogenic inputs since the Industrial Revolution (280 ppm: Pre-Industrial, to ∼410 ppm in 2014; 
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2014</xref>) and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values (from −6.5‰: Pre-Industrial to −8.5‰: present; 
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Araus &amp; Buxó, 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Elsig et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">White, Vaughn &amp; Michel, 2015</xref>) to examine the relationship between 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic>’ carbon isotope fractionation and leaf chemistry (C:N ratios) within a range of climate variables. The patterns of Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values over a range of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values highlight the limitations of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> change as a tool for better understanding the biosphere and atmosphere. If δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values change in sync with δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values, this could mean that carbon assimilation is continuing in this species as it was prior to Industrialization, perhaps indicating 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic>’ lack of adaptation to increased [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]. Additionally, it may indicate that δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> provides another way to track anthropogenic changes to the environment in the recent past and the future.
