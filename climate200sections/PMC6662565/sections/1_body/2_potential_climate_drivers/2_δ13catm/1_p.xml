<p>With the current increase in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>], we have observed the aforementioned Suess Effect, wherein Î´
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> has changed in response to increased inputs of more isotopically negative CO
 <sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Keeling, 1979</xref>). The composition of CO
 <sub>2</sub> involved in the making of organic tissue is likely to affect the composition of that organic tissue (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Arens, Jahren &amp; Amundson, 2000</xref>); our study will test if this effect is compounded or mitigated by changes in other climate variables over this chronologically robust natural experiment.
