 <caption> δ 13C leaf and seasonality. a) Box and Whisker plot showing median (lines), mean and range of spring, summer, fall and winter residual values of δ 13C leaf. T-tests assuming unequal variance comparing Spring vs. Summer, Fall, Winter, Summer vs. Fall, Winter, and Fall vs. Winter could not prove a null hypothesis; that the mean for all seasonal collections was significantly different. Seasons were categorized by mean monthly temperatures &lt;°2C, from 2–15°C and rising, &gt;15°C, and between 2–15°C and falling in the Great Lakes Region (centralized lower Peninsula Michigan), b) Scatter plot including residual from mean δ 13C leaf values as divided by month. </caption>
