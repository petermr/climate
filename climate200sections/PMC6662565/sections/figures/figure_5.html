 <caption> δ 13C leaf vs. δ 13C atm values of Thuja occidentalis. There is a linear relationship between δ 13C leaf and δ 13C atm values (‰) of T. occidentalis, defined by δ 13C leaf = 1.20 (±0.06 standard error) * (δ 13C atm) − 16.52(±0.44 standard error) with an R 2 value of 0.74 and a p-value &lt;0.001. Error bars along the y-axis represent the ±0.3‰ replicate reproducibility of standards, error bars along the x-axis represent the ±0.1‰ replicate reproducibility associated with the isotope-ratio mass spectrometer at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Data points represent specimens collected for this study. The regression line below is derived from Jahren, Arens &amp; Harbenson (2008), which used Raphanus sativus grown under elevated [CO 2] within growth chambers to look at the relationship between δ 13C leaf and δ 13C atm values. </caption>
