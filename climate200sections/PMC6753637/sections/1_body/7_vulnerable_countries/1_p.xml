<p>The countries that are most vulnerable to climate change
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> are often those that face the greatest barriers to achieving UHC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">fig 2</xref>). This is not surprising—both are related to the country’s economic strength and availability of resources. Because of the unique challenges they face, these regions have enormous opportunity to take a more integrated approach to their agendas. This would not be easy; given the financial restraints many of these countries already face related to healthcare, they might see tackling climate change as impossible. Implementing and optimising UHC, however, is a key strategy to minimise the health burdens of climate change and will probably be financially beneficial in the long run. Some countries might benefit more than others, but all can make immense gains from taking an integrated systems approach.
