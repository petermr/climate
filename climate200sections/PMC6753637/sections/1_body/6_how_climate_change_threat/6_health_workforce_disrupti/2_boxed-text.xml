  <title>Climate sensitive health and travel concerns</title>
  <p>Healthcare workers might provide lower quality of care if they have impaired cognitive function due to climate change (extreme heat,
   <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> nutritional deficiencies, and infectious diseases). Heat is of particular concern where air conditioning is permanently or frequently unavailable or water for cooling is scarce. Healthcare workers might also have difficulty reporting to work during extreme weather situations, such as when flooding disrupts roadways.

  <title>Climate change and health knowledge deficits</title>
  <p>Climate change alters existing disease burdens through various routes. Although a growing proportion of the healthcare workforce recognises that climate change negatively affects health, there are gaps in understanding around the details.

   <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Only 19% of disease control workers in China understood that poor people were at greater risk of climate change related health problems. In addition, only one-third had a good understanding of how climate change affects the transmission of infectious diseases.
