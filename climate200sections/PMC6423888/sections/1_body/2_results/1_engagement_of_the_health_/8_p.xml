<p id="Par24">While adaptation is classically defined as the ability to deal with change, it also encompasses the capacity to learn from it. Doing so requires investments in research and analytical systems, especially among public health practitioners. Of concern, a collaboration across several countries, including South Africa, noted that climate change and environmental health, in general, have not been mainstreamed within curricula at medical schools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The group noted that, given the limited capacity in this area, international assistance maybe required to develop curricula and teaching materials. Other studies in have documented considerable gaps in knowledge on climate change among university students across disciplines and the limited ability of these future leaders to engage with others on the topic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Overall, the research outputs by South Africa scientists on climate change has grown (around 600 academic publications in 2015), but only 3%, or about 20, of these publications make reference to health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Of more concern, a report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change group, using a narrower search strategy, located only about 20 papers related to climate change and health in the whole of Africa in 2017, constituting well under 10% of the total 300 such papers worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Reviews have also noted that little interdisciplinary work between meteorology and health has been done [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. But, perhaps most importantly, research investigating the performance of interventions to reduce the health impacts of climate change are largely absent [
