<p id="Par9">Accounting for the vegetation-fire feedback had the largest effect on the upper quartile of fire size, with this distribution being significantly lower under the dynamic scenario during mid- and late-century periods (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The distributions of the largest wildfires, which are often the most costly in terms of fire suppression efforts, were only significantly different during the mid-century period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). During the early-century period, the mean percentage of area burned was similar for the dynamic (15.2%) and static (15.7%) simulations. Accounting for the influence of prior area burned demonstrates the constraints imposed on the size of upper quartile and largest wildfires are substantial.
