 </sup>. The severity with which a forest fire burns is a function of fuels (forest structure and biomass density), topography, and weather

 </sup>. Given that we held the fire weather distribution constant between the scenarios, the only potential influence on fire severity was the effects of prior fire events on fuels. As a result, we found little difference in mean fire severity between the two scenarios (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) Thus, area burned was the sole factor influencing C storage on the landscape. Total ecosystem carbon (TEC) did not begin to deviate between the two scenarios until mid-century (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). By 2100, the dynamic scenario mean TEC was 729 Tg (±7.9, 95% CI) and the static scenario mean was 717 Tg (±10.6, 95% CI). This is largely driven by the fact that even with the vegetation-fire feedback, 44% of the mountain range burns over the simulation period.
