<p id="Par14">Our results demonstrate the importance of adequately characterizing the relationship between climate, ecosystems, and area burned over large landscapes for understanding how additional climate warming will alter future wildfire and carbon. Future wildfire and carbon trajectories in the Sierra Nevada will be the result of complex interactions between climate and weather, ecosystem and disturbance processes, and land management, all driven by accelerating climate change. Past experience provides inadequate analogues for interactions between climate-driven increases in disturbance magnitude and frequency. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating dynamic vegetation feedbacks to fire and carbon, we can better constrain our understanding of potential futures in the Sierra Nevada. However, the potential for extreme climatic events and their effect on disturbance processes such as widespread beetle and drought-related tree mortality, subsequent wildfire, and resulting forest succession pathways, assure us of surprises ahead.</p>
