<p id="Par11">While our results demonstrate that accounting for the vegetation-fire feedback leads to a lower rate of increase in area burned with changing climate, area burned remains likely to increase. Our simulations estimate that the vegetation-fire feedback is only responsible for 7.5% of the cumulative area burned because vegetation re-growth happens with sufficient speed that the fuel limitation effects from fire are short-lived
