<p>Human-pathogenic fungi constitute only a very small minority of an enormous number of fungal species in the environment, numbering in the few hundred (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In contrast to ectothermic animals and plants, mammals are remarkably resistant to invasive fungal diseases. Mammalian resistance to invasive fungal diseases is proposed to result from a combination of high basal temperatures, which create a thermal restriction zone, and advanced host defense mechanisms in the form of adaptive and innate immunity (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this regard, the emergence of such thermodynamically unfavorable animals as mammals as the dominant large animals has been proposed to have resulted from a fungal filter at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary that prevented a second reptilian age (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). According to this theory, fungal pathogens are rare in mammals because this group of animals was selected by the fungi at the end of the Cretaceous period (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Supporting this view are the facts that the majority of fungi grow well in ambient temperatures and that only a small percentage of species can replicate at 37Â°C (

For example, the high prevalence of mycoses in individuals with advanced HIV infection was a result of a weakening of the immune system, while the white-nose syndrome in bats occurs during their hibernation process, when their temperature drops (
