 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> is an ascomycetous yeast and a close relative of the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida haemulonii</named-content> species complex, which includes species occasionally pathogenic in humans and animals and demonstrates a high level of baseline antifungal drug resistance (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). This phylogenetic connection may explain its low susceptibility to antifungal agents and the possession of virulence attributes that confer it with pathogenic potential. To evaluate our hypothesis, we compared the thermal susceptibility of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> to those of some of its close phylogenetic relatives and found that the majority of these relatives were not tolerant for mammalian temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.Â 1</xref>). Although this tree reveals that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> is capable of growing at higher temperatures than most of its closely related species, it does not inform as to whether this is a new trait. It is noteworthy that the earliest description of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> came from a strain recovered from a human ear, which is much cooler than core body temperatures. Hence, this fungus may have gone through a short transient period during which it inhabited human surfaces before being associated with disease. Currently, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> preferentially colonizes the cooler skin rather than the hotter gut mycobiome, a preference that may be consistent with a recent acquisition of thermotolerance.
