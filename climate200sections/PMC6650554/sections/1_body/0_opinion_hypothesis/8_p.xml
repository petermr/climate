<p>Although global warming-related changes in the environment might have played a prominent role in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content>â€™s emergence, this variable is unlikely to explain the whole story. For example, it is difficult to see how global warming alone explains the spontaneous emergence of four clades of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> strains in geographically disparate regions, each separated by thousands of years of evolutionary distance from each other, unless there is another common epidemiological variable that facilitated the interaction with humans for virulence to become apparent. Assuming that 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> has other hosts in the biosphere, it is possible that climate change affects those hosts also and provides an additional variable for the emergence of this organism as a human-pathogenic fungus. We note that the recent clustering of cases in certain geographic regions, such as the northeastern United States, is a postemergence event that follows the proposed adaptation to climate change and probably reflects local infection control issues (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Finally, we note that all four clades contain MTLa and MTLa loci (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which raises the possibility that they may interact through mating if their current geographic isolation is ended by inadvertent human transport or migratory bird patterns.
