<p>The distribution of each species in current climatic conditions was estimated using 300 predictions (6 SDMs x 50 randomizations). The simulations for future climatic conditions were estimated obtaining 1,200 predictions (6 SDM’s x 50 randomizations x 4 AOGCM’s) for each future scenario (2050 and 2080) and carbon emission scenario (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5), totaling 4,800 future predictions. This replication allowed us to generate a frequency of projections for each SDMs, which were weighted by the True Skill Statistics (TSS), i.e., better models according to this metric will have more weight in our consensus projections. The TSS statistic varies from -1 to +1, where values equal to +1 are a perfect prediction and values equal to or less than 0 are no better than random ones [

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to obtain the final consensus model for each species. This method considers the species present only in cells where at least 50% of the models retained in the ensemble predicted the species to be present. The modeling of species distribution was performed in the BioEnsembles computational platform [
