<p>The range size of each species was the sum of the number of occupied cells within the MDB. Temporal variations of the range size were analyzed by comparing the frequency distribution of the number of cells occupied by individual species. Taxonomic diversity and range size of individual species were obtained for current, 2050 and 2080 scenarios and for the different carbon emission levels, considering the outputs of our combined model (i.e. correlative models described by CONS truncated by the upper thermal tolerance limits).</p>
