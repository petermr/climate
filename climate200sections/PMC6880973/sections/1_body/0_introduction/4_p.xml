<p>Australia’s freshwater ichthyofauna is impoverished due to the country’s long isolation from other continents, combined with an arid climate and low rainfall, which result in widespread freshwater scarcity [

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Australia’s largest river basin, the Murray-Darling Basin, freshwater fishes are already exposed to numerous threats, such as flow regulation, habitat degradation, introduced species, exploitation and stocking [

Native fish population sizes in the Murray-Darling Basin have been estimated to be 10% of their pre-European-settlement levels, and more than half of the Basin’s native fish species are now listed as threatened or of conservation concern [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The impacts of climate change on fish communities can be even greater for species-depauperate systems, in which the loss or the gain of a small number of species may lead to a disproportionate shift in assemblage composition [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Forecasting the potential impacts of climate change on fish species composition and functional diversity in the Murray-Darling Basin is crucial in identifying effective conservation strategies to preserve this already threatened ichthyofauna and the important ecosystem services they provide [
