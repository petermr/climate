<p>The highest values of FDis corresponded with the highest values of FRic in the current scenario. Rivers from the Northeast region (e.g. Macintyre, Gwydir, Namoi) showed the highest FDis values. The upper Murray River and its major tributaries such as the Ovens and Goulburn Rivers also exhibited high functional dispersion values, and in the future, the trend of constraining of high values toward high altitudes in the Southeast region was the same for taxonomic and functional indices (
