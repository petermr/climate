<p>Regions of the MDB with highest values of FUni for the present scenario were the Condamine River catchment upstream of St George, the lowlands reaches of Northeast Region catchments, the lower Darling River together with small areas of some of the eastern rivers (e.g the Macquarie-Castlereagh; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225128.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This spatial pattern differs from both species richness and functional richness for the current scenario. These areas (North and Northeast) are also predicted to be the most heavily affected in the future. For 2050, areas of high FUni contract the very upper reaches only of smaller rivers such as the Border Rivers, Gwydir and Namoi are predicted to retain the highest functional uniqueness, while for 2080 the highest values were predicted in the upper reaches of the Macquarie, Lachan, Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers, following the taxonomic and functional richness tendencies (
