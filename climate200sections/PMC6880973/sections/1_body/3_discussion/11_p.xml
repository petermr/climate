<p>In conclusion, this paper models the response of taxonomic and functional diversity of freshwater fishes of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, under two carbon emission scenarios (

 <italic>business-as-usual</italic>) for the years 2050 and 2080. The addition of physiological parameters representing the upper thermal tolerance limit of individual fish species offers some advantages over correlative modelling alone, because it can indicate locations in geographic space with a heat safety margin for species survival, thus guiding conservation efforts to the most promising areas. Our study suggests that native fish assemblages of the Murray-Darling Basin are sensitive to climate change, given the pronounced range contractions, species extinctions and changes to ecosystem functionality predicted to occur between now and the end of the century. Currently, there is a considerable effort being made to rehabilitate and sustainably manage the Basin. Initiatives such as the Native Fish Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin (2003â€“2013) and Murray-Darling Basin Plan (2012 and ongoing), have outlined holistic targets for rehabilitating native fish including through investment in the provision of environmental flows, the installation of fishways, physical habitat restoration, the management of non-native fish species, and fish translocations and stocking [
