<p>The southern portion of the MDB basin (Murray River catchment) currently supports a larger number of fish species than the arid western and northern parts of the basin (Darling River catchment), where rivers can dry to isolated waterholes in low-rainfall years [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the southeast portion of Murray-Darling Basin is predicted to retain the highest number of species and greatest functional diversity in the face of predicted climate change, our results also predict great losses of habitat suitability, with regions of greater richness retracting to higher altitudes as climate refuge. Indeed, favorable climatic-environmental conditions at higher altitudes in the face of climate change have been documented in several studies ([

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]). For temperate species of stream fish in France, predictions suggest systematic species range shifts towards higher elevations and upstream reaches basin in response to climate change, with mean shifts in range center of 13.7 m decade
 <sup>-1</sup> and 0.6 km decade
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively [
