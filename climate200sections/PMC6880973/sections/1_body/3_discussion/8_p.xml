<p>The reduction of all functional traits under future climate scenarios tends to imply declines in the ability of fish assemblages to continue to provide comparable ecosystem services. Consistent with previous studies evaluating climate change responses of ichthyofauna in the MDB [

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], some functional traits even decreasing in response to the loss of some species, can enlarge the proportional contribution within the future scenarios, as we observed in our most pessimistic (2080 8.5). When considered only future scenarios, the traits AGEMAT, EGG, TMAX, TMIN, LONG, NON-MOV, PARC, INV, INV-PISC and VPBEN tend to show better performance, especially in the pessimistic
