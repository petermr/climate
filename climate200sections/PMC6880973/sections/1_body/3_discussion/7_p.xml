<p>Regions of the MDB showing the highest current values for functional dispersion and uniqueness (e.g. the lower Darling River and the upper Condamine River catchment) also have the lowest fish species richness. In this circumstance, it is more likely that the loss of a given species will have large impacts on ecosystem processes and functionality. In this context, the conservation of these areas is arguably as important as protecting the richest areas. The future scenarios of 
 <italic>stabilization</italic> (RCP 4.5) predicted high functional uniqueness in some smaller rivers in the northeast region (e.g. Gwydir and Lachan Rivers), however, in the 
 <italic>business-as-usual</italic> scenarios (RCP 8.5) it was primarily the upper Murray River and Murrumbidgee Rivers in the southeastern region of the MDB that displayed more distinct assemblages. Such areas will become increasingly significant for conservation, because high values of functional uniqueness contribute disproportionately to maintaining a high level of functional diversity than species having common traits shared by other species (i.e. high functional redundancy) and may actually help to stabilize ecosystem processes as a result of functional niche complementarity [
