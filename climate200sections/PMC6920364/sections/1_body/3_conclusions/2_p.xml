<p id="Par33">It is found that it is desirable for all constituent components to have the same directional elasticity to a composite indicator for robustness of vulnerability scores generated by multiplicative multi-attribute utility forms in order to avoid undesirable ranking reversals. It is also implied that the uncertainty in vulnerability outcomes can increase with the use of potential impact with more weighted coping that tends to have more uncertainty

 </sup>. Multiplicative aggregation allows lesser compensation for low value components whereas additive aggregation provides constant trade-offs among constituent components. When the assessment components are mutually preferentially independent, full substitution should not be allowed across components in general. In such contexts, this study suggests that the coastal flood vulnerability to climate change be evaluated by a multiplicative composite indicator

 <sub>2</sub> from the IPCCâ€™s three components with all the positive elasticity to vulnerability, since regions with a lower component value cannot be fully compensated for by other component values. If trade-offs are not allowed at all, the vulnerability should be assessed by non-compensatory multi-criteria methods. It is important to select a proper framework and aggregation method to construct vulnerability composite indicators, since an undesirable composite indicator outcome due to overlooking irrational features in some aggregations may cause preference reversals in policy and decision making. It should therefore be prudent to select aggregation frameworks for composite indicators with careful consideration of the objectives and features of the vulnerability assessments, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each aggregation method that may have problematic limitations in construction processes and schemes.
