<p id="Par27">For further comparative analysis of various flood vulnerability outcomes as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> also lists the ten selected administrative districts that showed significant ranking fluctuations across various flood vulnerability outcomes, including the normalized values of three assessment components 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>, and 
 <italic>LC</italic>(
 <italic>C</italic>), and the flood vulnerability rankings by the six composite indicators 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. Higher flood vulnerability rankings are determined by the multiplicative aggregation forms 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, compared to the additive indicators 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, as shown in districts 2620, 2811, 3114, 4122, and 4127, where the value of neither 
 <italic>E</italic> nor 
 <italic>S</italic> is too low. On the contrary, the flood vulnerability rankings of districts 2611, 4678, 4682, and 4885 are mostly higher in the additive indicators 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> that have higher compensability by the highest level value for either 
 <italic>E</italic> or 
 <italic>S</italic>, as compared to the multiplicative outcomes by 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> also shows that there is a notable ranking difference between 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> in district 2611, which has the three component values comparable to reference case (11) in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> produces an identical vulnerability for both reference case (11) with H-M-L(H) and reference case (9) with H-L-M(M), in which both combinations are equivalent to each other. However, the vulnerability of reference case (9) is much lower than that of reference case (11) in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, although the two cases have equivalent scores for the three constituent components. A similar ranking fluctuation between 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> occurs in district 5011, ranked as the most vulnerable district by 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, where a low denominator value of the coping component 
 <italic>C</italic> will generate abnormally large composite indicator outcomes, as addressed in Section 3. In some districts, the flood vulnerability rankings of the 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> aggregated from the three components 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>, and 
 <italic>LC</italic> with the equal weights of 1/3 are different from those of the 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> derived from more weighted 
 <italic>LC</italic> by 1/2 and less weighted 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic> by 1/4. As compared to 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> showed lower flood vulnerability rankings in districts 2611, 2811, 3144, and 4122, with relatively low values of 
 <italic>LC</italic>, while higher flood vulnerability outcomes were observed in districts 4678, 4682, 4885, and 5011, with relatively high values of 
 <italic>LC</italic>. Such ranking changes appear more prominently in comparing the two multiplicative indicators between 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, rather than in the two additive indicators between 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. The flood vulnerability outcomes are similar between 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and between 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> in districts 2620 and 4127, respectively, with middle level values of 
 <italic>LC</italic>.
