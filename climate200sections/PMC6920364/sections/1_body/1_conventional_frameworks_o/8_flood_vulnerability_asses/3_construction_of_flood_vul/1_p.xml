<p id="Par20">The proxy variables need to be carefully selected and constructed based on the full context of availability, representatives, measurability, integrity, analytical soundness, relevance to phenomena, and relationship to each other

In the selection of proxy variables for this study, the main focus was on human and property damage by coastal flooding due to climate change. With reference to previous studies
