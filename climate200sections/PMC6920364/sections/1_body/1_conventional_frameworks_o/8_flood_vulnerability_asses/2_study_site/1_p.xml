<p id="Par19">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the study site comprises the 73 coastal administrative districts in the Republic of Korea for a comparative analysis of the flood vulnerability ranking orders to climate change across various composite indicators by different aggregation frameworks. The study site is located between 33~43°N and 124~131°E, which extends southwards from continental Asia into the Pacific Ocean. The Korean peninsula is surrounded by the East Sea to the east, the West Sea to the west, and the Korea Strait to the south. The western and southern coasts are irregular with many islands, whereas the eastern coastline is relatively straight. More than half of the annual precipitation falls over the study site between June and September mainly due to the East Asian monsoon and several typhoons. There have recently been severe flood damages in coastal areas of the Republic of Korea due to climate change impacts, as well as geomorphological features.
