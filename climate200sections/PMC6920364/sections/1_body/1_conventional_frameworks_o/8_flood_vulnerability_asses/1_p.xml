<p id="Par18">Flood vulnerability assessment is one of the essential tools for providing preemptive information on current flood mitigation plans, wherein severe flood damages occur more frequently. Flood vulnerability has been commonly evaluated with a composite indicator compiled from multiple assessment components by easily selecting one of the various aggregation schemes. Although it is natural that different aggregation schemes may generate different composite indicators, it is necessary to understand the impact of different aggregation schemes on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Therefore, a case study on flood vulnerability assessment to climate change is conducted by various aggregation frameworks for the three relevant components in the IPCC TAR
