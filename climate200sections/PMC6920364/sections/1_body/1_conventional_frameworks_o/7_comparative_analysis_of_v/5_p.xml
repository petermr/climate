 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for comparison of the additive and the multiplicative aggregation functions, the multiplicative composite indicator 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> (where excluding 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> with some anomalies) generates higher vulnerability scores in case (12) with M-M-L(H) and case (13) with M-L-M(M) than cases (14) with L-L-H(L) and (15) with H-L-L(H). These four reference cases all have the same vulnerability scores in the additive composite indicators 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>. Case (6) with M-M-M(M) is higher than case (7) with H-H-L(H) in the multiplicative outcomes by 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, but case (6) is less than case (7) in the additive outcomes by 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>. Thus, the outcomes of the additive composite indicators could be compensated with a higher score in any of the three components, while a lower score in any of the three components could drastically reduce the outcomes of multiplicative composite indicators. This is due to the fact that the additive aggregation functions show the higher compensability in that the composite indicators from deficient components can be compensated for by surplus scores of other components, which can hardly compensate for low components in the multiplicative aggregation functions.
