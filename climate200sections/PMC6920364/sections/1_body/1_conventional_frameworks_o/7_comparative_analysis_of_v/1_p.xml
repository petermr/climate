<p id="Par12">To investigate the performance of vulnerability indicators aggregated from the three components of exposure, sensitivity, and lack of coping (or coping) by the six multi-attribute utility functions in Eqs. (
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) through (
 <xref rid="Equ8" ref-type="">8</xref>), after assigning equal weights to all component indicators, the three normalized values of 100.0, 50.5, and 1.0 are chosen for representing high (H), middle (M), and low (L) level scores for each constituent component. Note that 1.0 is taken to represent the low-level score to avoid dividing by zero for coping in Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, a total of eighteen possible combinations of the three components are implemented for the variation of vulnerability composite indicators. There can exist the six combinations of exposure and sensitivity levels without order of two, H-H, H-M (or M-H), H-L (or L-H), M-M, M-L (or L-M), L-L with respect to the three levels, H, M, and L for lack of coping (or L, M, and H for coping). For example, case (1) comprises three score levels of H-H-H(L) for 
 <italic>E</italic>||
 <italic>S</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>||
 <italic>E</italic>, and 
 <italic>LC</italic>(
 <italic>C</italic>) (where “||” denotes “OR”).
