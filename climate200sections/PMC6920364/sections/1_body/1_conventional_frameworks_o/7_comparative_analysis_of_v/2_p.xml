<p id="Par13">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the eighteen reference cases are arranged from the highest in case (1) to the lowest in case (18) by scoring patterns of the three components. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> present the comparisons of vulnerability values (in lines) and ranking orders (in bars) across different aggregation forms, such as the two addictive forms (
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) and the two multiplicative forms (
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, and across different aggregation components such as the three components (VA
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) and the two components (
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Note that in order to approximately present the vulnerability changes between the two discrete reference cases, the vulnerability values for each of the two adjacent cases are linearly connected by lines in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.
