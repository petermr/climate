 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> also demonstrates that the vulnerability ranking results can significantly differ depending on the selection of the vulnerability indicators in this case study. As already mentioned, it is desirable to rank the coastal districts vulnerable to flooding using the multiplicative indicators because higher vulnerability results are expected for the coastal areas where all the assessment components are more vulnerable. However, a multiplicative indicator 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is problematic in that low-level coping values generate undesirable ranking changes as typically denoted in district 5011. The undesirable impact of this problem can also reach the unfavorable ranking alterations in districts 2814, 2650, 2629, 2638, 2617, and 2611. Meanwhile, the additive vulnerability indicators generate higher vulnerability outcomes by one of the much higher-level values in the constituent components, which results in the overestimated districts 2611 and 5011, where one of the assessment components is at the highest level. On the contrary, there are the underestimated vulnerability outcomes by the additive vulnerability indicators in some districts, 2629, 2638, 2617, and 2818, without very high level components. District 2611 has an abnormally higher ranking in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> due to ranking changes with other underestimated districts. It likewise has a higher ranking in 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> by compensation of the maximum 
 <italic>S</italic> than in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, which is also higher than in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> with more weights to the minimum 
 <italic>LC</italic>. As low-level coping values will generate undesirable ranking changes in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>, district 5011 with the minimum 
 <italic>C</italic> shows the abnormally highest ranking in 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. District 5011 also has higher rankings in 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, with more weights to the maximum 
 <italic>LC</italic>, compared to rankings in 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. Note that districts 2611 and 5011, with the extreme level coping values, might provide much different flood vulnerability outcomes in the aggregation framework using a denominator coping or a more weighted coping.
