<p id="Par4">Since there is no prominent scheme or standard method for constructing the vulnerability composite indicator from individual attribute components, vulnerability to many aspects of natural and social sciences and humanities has been estimated somewhat discretionally by simply selecting one of several aggregation frameworks and methods. Many vulnerability assessment studies have presented various vulnerability composite indicators generated from the constituent components by either additive utility functions or multiplicative utility forms conventionally and in general

 </sup>. Some of the previous studies addressed multiple frameworks for constructing vulnerability composite indicators

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, but it is deemed acceptable in most studies that a single aggregation method is simply selected without considering the purpose and characteristics of each vulnerability assessment. Although there is limited comparison of the vulnerability outcomes from different aggregation methods by using only the correlation coefficients between them

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
