 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00672-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)—comprised of shrimp farmers, fry collectors, and shrimp and fry traders—in order to complement the ethnographic data. In order to conduct an in-depth qualitative study, we set specific selection criteria for the respondents that prioritized experienced participants who have the greater depth of understanding and knowledge of shrimp aquaculture and local climate change. Shrimp cultivators: (1) Residing in the village or locality since their birth, (2) Spent at least 15 years in shrimp farming, and (3) Experienced at least one major climate extreme in their lifetime. Shrimp fry (postlarvae) collectors: (1) Residing in the village or locality since their birth, (2) Spent at least 15 years in shrimp fry catching, and (3) Experienced at least one major climate extreme in their lifetime. Shrimp/PL trader: (1) Spent at least 15 years in shrimp or fry trading, and (2) Experienced at least one major climate extreme during their business years.
