<p>This research finds two issues that explain the similarities between perceptions of common people and scientific data on climate change in Bangladesh. First, people living in the coastal areas of Bangladesh are among the first victims of climate change in the world. Coastal Bangladesh is an ideal zone for gradual onset changes in climate due to global warming as well as for climate extremes. This is a vulnerable area for sea-level rise (SLR), salinity intrusion, severe cyclones, storm surges, increase of sea surface temperature (SST) and other climate chaos. People living here experience the shifting weather patterns directly through extreme events and indirectly through consequent changes in the quality of water, air, and food as well as changes in human settlements, ecosystems, agriculture, industry, and the economy [

To them, vivid and recent experiences overwhelm abstract statistics about climate change. As we know, human brain is designed to attend to the immediate situation, not out-of-sight data and beyond-the-horizon dangers [

 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, the coastal people can very well map the regime change. Inhabitants of all the three areas live within 70-80 km up-estuary. They regularly monitor the height of tide in the rivers, feel the changes in salinity level in water and soil, and watch catastrophic cyclones and storm surges. The coastal people in Bangladesh, as a vulnerable group, see climate change as something already occurring, rather than something coming in the future. Thus, their perceptions are based on the real changes in the exposed ecosystemsâ€”they do not just rely on theoretical narratives.
