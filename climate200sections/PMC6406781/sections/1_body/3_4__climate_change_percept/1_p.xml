<p>Climate change is a well-established policy discourse in Bangladesh. Most people are more or less aware about it. Shrimp farming communities in Mongla, Koyra and Shyamnagar also understand environmental and climate change in their own ways. Shrimp farmers consider environmental and climate perturbations—together with disease outbreaks in shrimp, scarcity of disease-free post-larvae, lack of sufficient credit flow, lack of proper knowledge and training, and illegal status of fry catching—as one of the major challenges to the industry [

One notable point is that their perceptions were influenced by the season and timing of the interviews and the immediate past season. For example, a major part of data collection for this study was conducted in the summer of 2014, so they replied questions on heat waves and temperature changes judging that year’s experience; similarly, they answered questions on changes in winter weather mainly based on their experience of the immediate past winter season. Nevertheless, despite this type of ‘incumbency effect’ of weather, shrimp-farming people strived to compare weather patterns between the present and the past 10–15 years. Overall, aquaculturists from all the three sites have fairly similar opinions on changes in weather/climate parameters and changes in the climate. While the impact of changes in climate and environmental conditions and shocks may be different in line with the level of well-being of the household, there are no differences between them in perceiving the changes, since all households of the three areas tend to witness the same climate phenomena.
