<p>From a biopsychological point of view, human perception is the final part of a complex psychophysical process. At first, an information from the environment (e.g., light, sound) activates a person’s sense receptors in sensory organs. Then, through transduction process, the sense receptors convert the physical energy from stimulus into electrical signals called neural impulses and send them to the brain. When neural impulses reach the particular area in the brain, they are changed into meaningless bits of information called sensation, which involves the detection of sensory stimuli. These meaningless bits of information are finally changed into meaningful and complete images called perception—the interpretation of sensory stimuli [
