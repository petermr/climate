<p>Media representation of environmental risks is also influenced by dominant debates on the risks. Giddens (2008) distinguished three different positions of scientists in climate change debates. First, the climate change 
 <italic>skeptics</italic> claim there is no ample evidence that present-day processes of global warming are produced by human activity. They argue that the current fluctuation in climate is produced by natural causes, as were the similar cases in the past. Second, the 
 <italic>mainstream</italic> scientists, led by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are at consensus about anthropogenic causes of global warming. Ninety seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and is human-made [

The radicals, who originated from the mainstream bloc, see climate change as a present reality, and not merely a future possibility, since they argue that many parts of the world has already been affected by global warming. Neverla and colleagues (2012) identify a fourth group of scientists whom they call ‘pragmatists’. The 
 <italic>pragmatists</italic> hold that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming; however, they are unconvinced of mainstream scientists’ predictions about future climate changes, which they believe are often exaggerated in media [
