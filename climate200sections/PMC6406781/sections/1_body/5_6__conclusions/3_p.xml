<p>In a warmer regime, traditional sources of livelihood are seriously threatened and people’s quality of life is in danger of deterioration among vulnerable communities around the globe. In addition to scientific data and grand models, local stakeholders’ perceptions are crucial in determining the changes and variations in local-level weather pattern in different agroecological zones. Appropriate policy and programmatic interventions for exposed communities can be formulated based on the findings of studies on climate change perceptions in those communities. This research is an addition to the systematic collection of such information from a climate hotspot. </p>
