 </bold> show that these propositions apply to views on renewable energy and climate change. In each figure the (a) panels depicts 2018 New Hampshire data, and the (b) panels the 2018 Oregon data. Generally similar results also occurred in the North Country and nationwide surveys, and in earlier years from the New Hampshire and Oregon projects (not shown). Younger, female and better educated respondents more often prioritize renewable energy, and more often agree that humans are changing Earthâ€™s climate. Across each of these four panels, ideological or political indicators have by far the strongest effects, with liberal-conservative or Democrat-Republican gaps of 53 or 44 points on renewable energy, and 71 or 50 points on climate. Age differences are less strong but also consistent, with young versus old gaps of 13 or 17 points on renewable energy, and 16 or 22 points on climate.
