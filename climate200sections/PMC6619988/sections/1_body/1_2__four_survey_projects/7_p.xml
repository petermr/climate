<p>Comparisons between renewable-energy and climate-change views in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g002">2</xref> suggest that renewable energy development is viewed favorably by many people who do not believe that human activities are changing the climate. Moreover, the aggregate results imply that renewable energy views correlate less strongly with politics. The next section tests this inference directly, and explores how other characteristics correlate with these views.
