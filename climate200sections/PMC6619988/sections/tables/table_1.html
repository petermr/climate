    <i>Polar</i>, 
    <i>Environment</i>, 
    <i>and Science</i> (POLES, nationwide). The POLES survey involved random-sample telephone interviews (cell and landline) with respondents from all US states, carried out in two stages: before the 2016 presidential elections (August, 
    <i>n</i> = 704) and immediately afterwards (November/December, 
    <i>n</i> = 707). Response rates in four subsamples of the POLES survey ranged from 15 to 30%, calculated by AAPOR definition 3.[

    <i>Granite State Poll</i> (GSP, New Hampshire statewide). These landline and cell telephone surveys interview independent, statewide random samples of New Hampshire residents four times each year. Along with standard background and political questions, the GSP often carries items about environment or science. New Hampshire responses on environmental questions commonly fall close to national benchmarks. Several recent papers make comparisons between New Hampshire and nationwide surveys.[

    <a rid="pone.0217608.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</a>] The GSP from April 2010 to October 2018 conducted 20,786 interviews that included our climate-change question, and from July 2012 to October 2018 conducted 7,707 with the question about renewable energy. Median response rate over this period was 21.5 percent.

    <i>Communities and Forests in Oregon</i> (CAFOR, northeast Oregon). Under the CAFOR project, landline and cell telephone surveys involving independent random samples of northeast Oregon residents were conducted in four stages: September/October 2011 ( 
    <i>n</i> = 1,585 from Baker, Union and Wallowa Counties); August/October 2014 ( 
    <i>n</i> = 1,752, from the same three counties along with Crook, Grant, Umatilla and Wheeler Counties); October/November 2015 ( 
    <i>n</i> = 651, repeating the seven counties from 2014); and September 2018 ( 
    <i>n</i> = 1,097) in just the three original counties. Median response rate of the CAFOR surveys was 38 percent. For consistency, our analysis in this paper focuses on 3,782 interviews from only those counties (Baker, Union and Wallowa) that were surveyed in all four years. Voting patterns in all of these northeast Oregon counties tend to be politically conservative, and surveys find lower-than-national recognition of anthropogenic climate change.[

    <i>North Country</i> (northern New England). In summer 2017, researchers with the Carsey School of Public Policy (University of New Hampshire) conducted this random-sample cell and landline telephone survey of 1,650 residents in four contiguous northern New England counties, collectively termed the North Country: Coös and Grafton Counties, New Hampshire; Essex County, Vermont; and Oxford County, Maine. Designed to assess changes in residents’ perceptions of their rural communities, the 2017 survey (response rate of 19%) replicated some questions from earlier surveys, but also included new environmental and climate items. Some results are analyzed in papers by Hamilton et al.[
