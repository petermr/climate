<p id="p0065">To measure BGB, It was used root-to-shoot ratio, which has become the standard method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. The equation developed by 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">MacDicken (1997)</xref> to estimate belowground biomass was used. The equation is given below:
 <disp-formula id="fd4">
  <label>(4)</label>BGB = AGB Ã— 0.2 (2)
 </disp-formula>Where, BGB is below ground biomass, AGB is above ground biomass, 0.2 is conversion factor (or 20% of AGB).
