<p id="p0165">In both land use systems, the proportion of carbon stock was higher for above ground carbon, which is 41.49% and 41.28% in PNV and CGL, respectively. The second highest carbon stock proportion was the soil organic carbon and its percentage value 32.72% and 37.08% in the PNV and CGL, correspondingly (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Oliva-García et al. (2006)</xref> reported that 51% by proportion from the total carbon stock of tropical forest of Mexico was found in the soil. Normally, soils are the largest carbon pools in global terrestrial ecosystems, because they can contain three times more carbon than that contained in vegetation (
