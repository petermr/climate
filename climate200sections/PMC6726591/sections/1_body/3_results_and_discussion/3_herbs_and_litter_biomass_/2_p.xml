<p id="p0145">The biomass carbon stock of herbs and litters were showed statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.001) between the two-land use systems (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The litter carbon stock was significantly lower in the CGL compared to the PNV. The mean carbon stock of herb and litter biomass in PNV was 0.60 and 0.10 ton/ha, and 0.34 and 0.03 ton/ha in adjacent CGL, respectively. The reason for relatively higher litter and herb biomass carbon stock in PNV could be due to the presence of higher species density, and less human and livestock interference than in CGL. A higher herbs and litters carbon stocks in the PNV compared to the adjacent communal grazing land in our study was consistent with the report of 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Solomon et al. (2017)</xref> where the herbaceous biomass were significantly higher in exclosure than the adjacent communal grazing land. This might be due to the fact that continuous heavy grazing in communal grazing land inhibits the growth of herbaceous layers and decrease aboveground herbaceous biomass through direct removal, leading to the depletion of herb and litter carbon stocks. Similar reports indicated a significant difference in herbaceous carbon stocks between PNV and the adjacent communal grazing land (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bikila et al., 2016</xref>). The significant increase of herb and litter carbon biomass compared to the communal grazing land may be indicates the potential for the restoration of the herb and litter biomass through range restoration.
