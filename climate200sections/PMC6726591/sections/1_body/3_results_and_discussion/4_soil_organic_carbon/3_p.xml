<p id="p0155">The mean values of soil organic carbon were 16.60 ± 4.45 and 13.76 ± 4.76 ton/ha for PNV and CGL, respectively. This value indicated that, the mean value of SOC was higher at the PNV than CGL and have significantly difference (P &lt; 0.05) (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Derner and Schuman (2007)</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wolde and Aynekulu (2011)</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bikila et al. (2016)</xref>, who reported that restoration of rangelands soils and ecosystems with permanent vegetation has high potential for soil carbon sequestration. The differences in SOC stocks between the PNV and CGL could be attributed to an increased vegetation biomass and the subsequent production and decomposition of litter fall from the vegetation that could add more organic matter into the soil systems. Thus, grazing lands with more aboveground vegetation biomass contribute more to carbon sequestration potential of the soil as compared to CGL having less aboveground vegetation biomass. This result agreed with the work of 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bikila et al. (2016)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Mekuria (2013)</xref> who reported that SOC was higher for PNV than open grazing areas. 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sheikh et al. (2009)</xref> also reported that high SOC mass was recorded in the protected areas compared to open grazing lands. The management practice through area exclosure has been contributed to increased soil organic carbon. Exclosure, which removed grazing pressure and allowed regeneration of native vegetation, increased SOC in the top soil (
