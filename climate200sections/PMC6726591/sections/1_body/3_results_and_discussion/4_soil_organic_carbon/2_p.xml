<p id="p0150">The soil organic carbon (SOC) showed variation among the different soil depth in both land use systems. Statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) were observed in soil organic carbon across the three soil depth profiles i.e. 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm and 20–30 cm (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which has been reduced down across the soil depths. The pattern indicates that soil carbon was highly accumulated in the upper soil layers at both land use systems. Similar reports by
