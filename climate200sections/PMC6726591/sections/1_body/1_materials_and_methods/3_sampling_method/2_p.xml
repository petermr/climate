<p id="p0030">Reconnaissance survey was made throughout the study areas prior to the field layout for vegetation, biomass, and soil sampling. Accordingly, sampling sites were identified in the protected natural vegetation (PNV) of 3500 ha and communal grazing land (CGL) of 3700 ha for data collection. Each land use types were further stratified based on on homogeneity in floristic composition and distributional pattern. Then systematic transect sampling technique was used to collect the vegetation and soil data within the strata of the two land use systems (PNV and CGL). A parallel line transects were laid at 500m interval that lie with parallel to the slope of the stand (19 transect sampling, 10 from PNV and 9 from CGL). The first quadrat was laid randomly and the others systematically at 500m intervals along the transect line, which were laid parallel to the slope. The locations of the quadrats were marked by GPS and slope along transects were measured using clinometers. Along the transect lines, a total of 62 quadrats (31 from PNV and 31 from CGL) measuring 20 m × 20 m for trees, 5 m × 5 m sub-quadrats for shrubs, and 1 m × 1 m sub-quadrats for herbs/grasses, litter, and soil were laid down (
