<p id="p0045">The soil samples were collected in each quadrat along the transect line at three levels of soil depths i.e. 0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 cm using a soil auger. Then one soil core sample was taken from the centre of each transect line for soil bulk density (SBD) determination (

An equal weights of each sample of the corresponding depth were pooled and mixed together from a given transect line, air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve to separate debris and gravel. Finally, composite samples were equally divided into four and one has been randomly taken as a representative sample, which has been packed in plastic bags, labelled, sealed and transported to the soil laboratory. A total number of 57 soil samples were taken for bulk density determination. Thirty soil samples (10 transect x 3 soil depth) from PNV and 27 soil samples (9 transect x 3 soil depth) from CGL were collected. Then the soil sample was air-dried followed with oven dried at 105 °C for 24 hours at Mekelle soil laboratory research centre. Bulk density was measured using the core method (
