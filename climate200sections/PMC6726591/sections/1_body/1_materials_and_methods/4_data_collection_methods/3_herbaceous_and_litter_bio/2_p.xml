<p id="p0040">Destructive sampling method was used for measuring the biomass of grasses and herbs by harvesting whole parts of fresh samples within each quadrat, a size of 1 m × 1 m, using sickle from. All the herbaceous vegetation emerging within the quadrat areas were cut at the ground level, weighed, and a composite sample was obtained from each sub-quadrat for oven-dry mass determination in the laboratory (

The herb and litter samples (62 herb and 62 litters) were weighed using a digital scale (0.1-gram accuracy) and recorded. The samples were mixed well and 10–20% sub-sample was taken for dry to fresh biomass ratio. The samples collected were subjected to air and oven drying. Oven drying was set at 70 °C and observed for 24 hours or until the samples reached their stable weight (
