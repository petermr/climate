<p id="p0010">The decline of vegetation cover is one of the most serious environmental issues faced humankind today. In this respect, Ethiopia is facing severe degradation in both the highlands and the lowlands. Particularly, the Ethiopian grazing land ecosystems were faced challenges of intense degradation due to deforestation, agricultural land expansion, and continuous and heavy grazing (

Overgrazing is one of the major factors aggravated ecosystem degradation, which causes an increase in unpalatable species by destroying the most palatable species and reduce plant cover and biomass, thereby increase erosion hazard and reduce the overall productivity of the land (

As part of this national initiative the country has been broken the global record by planting more that 350 million tree seedlings per day on 29July 2019. Especially, the northern part of Ethiopia known as Tigray Regional State was much effective in practicing diverse conservation strategies on the severely affected and degraded landscapes for decades, in which area exclusion of livestock from free grazing and human interference were the most common (
