<p id="p0020">Rehabilitation of degraded communal grazing lands through establishing PNV has become increasingly important in Tigray region, northern Ethiopia. Hence, approximately 1.5 million hectares of land has been excluded from grazing in the last three decades in the region (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Seyoum etÂ al., 2015</xref>). However, information on carbon sequestration potentials of degraded grazing lands in the Tigray region of Ethiopia following the management practices such as area exclusion is lacking under the ever-changing climate. Such management influence on carbon sequestration potential of different land use types are least known in the country. Hence, this study was designed to determine carbon sequestration potentials of the two land use types, protected natural vegetation (PNV) and communal grazing land (CGL), of Gra-Kahssu natural vegetation. This would help to evaluate the impacts of conservation and management practices to support the planning process in effective conservation strategy for multiple benefits i.e. biodiversity conservation, livelihood support, and climate change mitigation.
