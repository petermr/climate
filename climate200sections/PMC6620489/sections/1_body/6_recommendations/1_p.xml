<p>The social workerâ€™s assessment is essential for collecting and disseminating information and assessing the severity of a given situation. Having chosen a framework for assessment in disaster interventions, the social worker should include an awareness of social work theories; knowledge of assessment; and principles of assessments. Of utmost importance in any assessment that involves interdisciplinary collaboration, the information collected should be integrated with the professionals who are also intervening in the disaster, although it could be stored separately. The social work profession has an important role to contribute to disaster research and practice. The outcome of the study recommends that social work interventions dealing with natural disasters should be developed in a participatory way in cooperation with the affected communities.</p>
