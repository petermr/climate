<p>The second theme emerged from the analysed data of the 10 participants from households affected by natural disasters. The participants provided diverse, but intense, descriptions indicating their experiences of climate-change-induced disasters and their vulnerability to these, including the role played by social work in such interventions. The participants remarked on the level of support received from social workers after experiencing natural disasters. The important coping strategy after a climate-change-induced disaster occurrence was threefold: having support from the social workers; the provision of food parcels; and the intervention of SRD.
