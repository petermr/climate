 <p>Yes, the social workers comes to visit us after a disaster to check the extent of damage.</p>
 <p>However, some social workers disappear and come back 6 to 8 months after the disaster has occurred.</p>
 <p>They will only give you money to assist to rebuild the damaged house property. We have received the money from social workers, but since it is long after the disaster has occurred, we use the money for something else.</p>
