<p>The findings of the study revealed that the majority of the participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) indicated that the types of natural disasters assessed were pertinent to climate-change-induced disasters. The social work assessment was conducted owing to various damages to property and livelihoods attributable to rain or floods [
 <italic>pula</italic>], windstorms [
 <italic>ledimo</italic>] and lightning [
 <italic>legadima</italic>]. The 50 households assessed by social workers reported that they had experienced the shock of natural disasters between 2012 and 2014. The duration of recovery from various disaster shocks took place over 2 months. The three most significant disaster shocks experienced by households were as follows: people had their property struck by lightning; their corrugated roof was blown away by hail and windstorms; and their crops damaged by floods. The findings are consistent with the findings of Zapf (
