Equally, like all other stakeholders, social workers are required to respond appropriately to the disaster impacts in order to address these adverse effects of climate-change-induced disasters.

 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) attest that social work should address factors that make communities vulnerable to natural disasters.
