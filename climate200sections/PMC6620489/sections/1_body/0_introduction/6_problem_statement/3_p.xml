<p>In most cases, in spite of social work centrality in the normal functioning of people, social workers are side-lined and considered only after the damage has been caused. If involved, they are required to perform miracles and be welfarists by distributing food parcels and other basic amenities. Social workers, in times of climate-change-induced disasters, can contribute positively by conducting multidimensional assessments, which can be of help for their intervention to incite responsibility in other stakeholders during such a critical and painful time.

Although social workers are responsible for conducting assessments on victims’ households, the key focus of their function is to render services to alleviate the impact of natural disasters on the livelihoods of people and increase their resilience capabilities. It is against this background that this article addresses the role of social work in disaster interventions.
