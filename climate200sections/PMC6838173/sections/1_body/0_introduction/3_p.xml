<p id="Par4">Here we study, theoretically, the role of both institutional reward and punishment in the context of climate change agreements. Previous works consider the public good as a linear function of the number of contributors

 </sup>). We depart from this linear regime by modeling the returns on the public good as a threshold problem, combined with an uncertain outcome, represented by a risk of failure. As a result – and as detailed below – the dynamical portrait of our model reveals new internal equilibria
