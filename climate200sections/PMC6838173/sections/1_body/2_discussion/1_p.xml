<p id="Par15">One might expect the impact of Reward and Punishment to lead to symmetric outcomes â€“ Punishment would be effective for high-cooperation the same way that Reward is effective for low-cooperation. In low-cooperation scenarios (under low risk, threshold or budget) Reward alone plays the most important role. However, in the opposite scenario, Punishment alone does not have the same impact. Either a favourable scenario occurs, where any policy yields a satisfying result, or Punishment cannot improve outcomes on its own. In the latter case, the synergy between both policies becomes essential to achieve cooperation. Such optimal policy involves a combination of the single policies, Reward and Punishment, which is dynamic, in the sense that the combination does not remain the same for all configurations of the population. It corresponds to employing pure Reward at first, when cooperation is low, switching subsequently to Punishment whenever a pre-determined level of cooperation is reached.</p>
