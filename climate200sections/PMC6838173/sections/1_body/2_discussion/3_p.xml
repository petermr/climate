<p id="Par17">The model used takes for granted the existence of an institution with a budget available to implement either Reward or Punishment. New behaviours may emerge once individuals are called to decide whether or not to contribute to such an institution, allowing for a scenario where this institution fails to exist

At present, and under the Paris agreement, we are witnessing the potential birth of an informal funding institution, whose goal is to finance developing countries to help them increase their mitigation capacity. Clearly, this is just an example pointing out to the fact that the prevalence of local and global institutional incentives may depend and may be influenced by the distribution of wealth available among parties, in the same way that it influences the actual contributions to the public good
