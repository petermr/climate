<p id="Par13">The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show that Reward can be instrumental in fostering pro-social behavior, while Punishment can be used for its maintenance. This suggests that, to combine both policies synergistically, pure-Reward (
 <italic>w</italic> = 1) should be applied at first, when there are few cooperators (low 
 <italic>k</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic>); above a certain critical point (
 <italic>k</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> = 
 <italic>s</italic>) one should switch to pure-Punishment (
 <italic>w</italic> = 0). In the Methods section, we demonstrate that, similar to linear Public Goods Games
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, in 
 <bold>CRD</bold>s this is indeed the policy which minimizes the advantage of the defector, even if we consider the alternative possibility of applying both policies simultaneously. In Methods, we also compute a general expression for the optimal switching point 
 <italic>s</italic>*, that is, the value of 
 <italic>k</italic> above which Punishment should be applied instead of Reward to maximize cooperation and group achievement. By using such policy — that we denote by 
 <italic>s</italic>* — we obtain the best results shown with an orange line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. We propose, however, to explore what happens in the context of a 
 <bold>CRD</bold> when 
 <italic>s</italic>* is not used. How much cooperation is lost when we deviate from 
 <italic>s</italic>* to either of the pure policies, or to a policy which uses a switching point different from the optimal one?
