<p id="Par8">In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> we compare the average group achievement 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub> (as a function of risk) in four scenarios: (
 <italic>i)</italic> a reference scenario without any policy (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., no reward or punishment, in black); and three scenarios where a budget is applied to (
 <italic>ii)</italic> rewards, (
 <italic>iii)</italic> punishment and (
 <italic>iv)</italic> a combination of rewards and sanctions (see below). Our results are shown for the two most paradigmatic regimes: low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) and high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) coordination requirements. Naturally 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub> improves whenever a policy is applied. Less obvious is the difference between the various policies. Applying only rewards (blue curves in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is more effective than only punishment (red curve) for low values of risk. The opposite happens when risk is high. On scenarios with a low relative threshold (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), rewards play the key role, with sanctions only marginally outperforming them for very high values of risk. For high coordination thresholds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) reward and punishment portray comparable efficiency in the promotion of cooperation, with pure-Punishment (
 <italic>w</italic> = 0) performing slightly better than pure-Reward (
 <italic>w</italic> = 1).
