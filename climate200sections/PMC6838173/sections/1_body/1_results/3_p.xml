<p id="Par10">Naturally, both mechanisms are inoperative whenever the per-capita incentives are inexistent (

 <italic>e</italic>., adjacent finite population states with opposite gradient sign, representing the analogue of fixed points in a dynamical system characterizing evolution in infinite populations). Above a certain fraction of cooperators the population overcomes the coordination barrier and naturally self-organizes towards a stable co-existence of cooperators and defectors. Otherwise, the population is condemned to evolve towards a monomorphic population of defectors, leading to the tragedy of the commons
