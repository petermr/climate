 <caption> Average group achievement η G as a function of the location of the switching point s. The switching point s corresponds to the configuration (fraction of Cs in the population, k/ Z) above which w suddenly switches from pure-Reward ( w = 1) to pure-Punishment ( w = 0). Assuming both policies are equally efficient, the optimal switching point occurs at 50% of cooperators ( k/ Z = 0.5). The far-left values of s correspond to a static policy of always pure-Punishment – the switch from pure-Reward to pure-Punishment occurs immediately at 0% of cooperators. On the far-right (switching point = 100%) a pure-Reward policy is depicted. We can also see what happens when the switch occurs too late or too early, for different values of risk. For low values of risk, it is significantly less harmful to have a late switch from Reward to Punishment than an early one, meaning that when the population configuration cannot be precisely observed, it is preferable to keep rewarding for longer. See Methods for the calculation of the optimal switching point ( s*) that maximizes cooperation fitness relative to defection – and consequent group achievement. Other parameters: Z = 50, B = 1, µ = 0.01, β = 5, N = 10, M = 3, c = 0.1, and δ = 0.025. </caption>
