  <p>Average group achievement

   <sub>

   </sub> as a function of risk. Left: Group relative threshold M/N = 3/10. Right: Group relative threshold M/N = 7/10. In both panels, the black line corresponds to a reference scenario where no policy is applied. The red line shows 
   <italic>η</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>G</italic>
   </sub> in the case where all available budget is applied to pure-Punishment (
   <italic>w</italic> = 0), whereas the blue line shows results for pure-Reward (
   <italic>w</italic> = 1). Pure-Reward is most effective at low risk values, while pure-Punishment is marginally the most effective policy at high risk. These features are more pronounced for low relative thresholds (left panel), and only at high thresholds does pure-Punishment lead to a sizeable improvement with respect to pure-Reward. Finally, the orange line shows the results using the combination of Reward and Punishment, leading (naturally) to the best results. In this case, we adopt pure-Reward (
   <italic>w</italic> = 1) when there are few cooperators and, above a certain critical point 
   <italic>k</italic>/
   <italic>Z</italic> = 
   <italic>s</italic> = 0.5, we switch to pure-Punishment (
   <italic>w</italic> = 0). As detailed in the main text (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Methods), 
   <italic>s</italic> = 0.5 provides the optimal switching point 
   <italic>s</italic>* for cooperation to thrive. Other parameters: Population size Z = 50, group size 
   <italic>N</italic> = 10, cost of cooperation 
   <italic>c</italic> = 0.1, initial endowment 
   <italic>B = </italic>1, budget 
   <italic>δ</italic> = 0.025, reward efficiency 
   <italic>a</italic> = 1, punishment efficiency 
   <italic>b</italic> = 1, intensity of selection 
   <italic>β</italic> = 5, mutation rate 
   <italic>µ</italic> = 0.01.
