 <caption> Emissions in the absence of behavioural change. In the socio-climate model, the factor ϵ( t) corresponds to the global CO 2 emissions should there be no change in human behaviour. Preceding 2014, ϵ( t) takes the historical emission trajectory (solid line) as human behaviour is not modelled here. Post 2014, ϵ( t) follows a saturating function (dashed line) to capture the saturation of global population size and energy needs. Details of this functional form can be found in the Methods section.
