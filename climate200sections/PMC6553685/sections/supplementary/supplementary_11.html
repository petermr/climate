 <caption> Functional form for perceived costs associated with climate change. The incentive of individuals to mitigate is in part based on their perceived costs of climate change f at some projected temperature T. We adopt a sigmoidal response curve for f( T) with variable curvature Ï‰ and horizontal shift T c (the explicit form of f( T) is provided in Methods). This form captures the expected non-linear increase in climate change impacts (cost) as temperature increases. (TIFF) </caption>
