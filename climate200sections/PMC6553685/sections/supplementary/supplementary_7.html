 <caption> Comparing temperature projections from the simple Earth system model with those of more complex climate models. a. Ensemble of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) using the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) as emission scenarios (figure from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [ 45]). Displayed are 95% confidence intervals based on annual means. Numbers and their colour denote the number of models used for each RCP scenario. b. Ensemble of simulations from the simple Earth system model that we use in our socio-climate model under the same RCP emission scenarios. Parameters are drawn from triangular distributions with upper and lower bounds given in S2 Table. (TIFF) </caption>
