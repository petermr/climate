 <caption> CO 2 emissions per capita by country. Total industrial CO 2 emissions per capita from the ten countries with the greatest cumulative output. Data was obtained from the CDIAC data repository [ 35]. From 1950-1980 we observe strong increases in emissions per capita among most of these countries as is seen globally in S8 Fig. Many of the countries peak in 1980 and follow slight downwards trends demonstrating a degree of country-level movement towards mitigation. Globally, this is not the case, however. (TIFF) </caption>
