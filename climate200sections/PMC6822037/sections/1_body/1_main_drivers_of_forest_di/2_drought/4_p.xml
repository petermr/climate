<p>Another uncertainty regarding the role of HF in drought‐induced tree mortality is the fact that most of the studies that seek to investigate the vulnerability to cavitation in trees are made in leaves and segments of branches (e.g., trunks and roots). Thus, little is known about in which scale other more basal organs are affected by extreme drought events (Mcculloh, Johnson, Meinzer, &amp; Woodruff, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0152" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This is a matter of great relevance, especially when we take into account the hypothesis of hydraulic segmentation, which postulates that more distal organs (leaves and small branches), which represent a lower carbon investment, tend to be more vulnerable to cavitation than more basal organs (trunk and roots) (Charrier et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0230" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). In this sense, to better understand the real impact of drought on water transport in different species, it is essential to better characterize the events of cavitation in different organs. This type of integrative approach has become possible thanks to the emergence of noninvasive methodologies such as the “optical vulnerability technique (OV)” and the “X‐ray computed microtomography (micro‐CT),” which allow the in vivo monitoring of the emergence and propagation of embolism events in different organs of plants exposed to drought (Brodribb et al.,
