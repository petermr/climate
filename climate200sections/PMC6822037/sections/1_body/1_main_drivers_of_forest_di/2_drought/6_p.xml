<p>Although tree mortality under drought conditions can be triggered by a combination of different effects (Adams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Hartmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Kono et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), the impact of such effects can vary significantly depending on the phenological stage and size of the plant (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0133" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Olson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0174" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). As trees grow taller, the distance to move water from roots to leaves gets longer, which increases the resistance along the pathway (Ambrose, Sillett, &amp; Dawson, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Fajardo, McIntire, &amp; Olson, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), resulting in an increase in the tension inside xylem vessels and in the risk of HF under drought conditions (Bennett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Fajardo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In fact, several studies already showed that taller trees, both within and across species, are more prone to drought‐induced cavitation, which greatly explain the reduction in growth, and the higher incidence of branch and whole dieback of taller individuals worldwide (Bennett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Fajardo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Lindenmayer &amp; Laurance, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0131" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). To keep the water transport and avoid the risks of HF, taller trees usually display a set of morpho‐physiological alterations on their hydraulic system, such as the reduction in leaf area to sapwood area (Ambrose et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; McDowell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0154" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Although these alterations can significantly compensate for the reduction in hydraulic efficiency, the reduced leaf area can potentially limit the global carbon assimilation of taller trees, possibly making them more prone to carbon starvation on extreme drought events (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0134" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Conversely, other studies have shown that the set of adjustments in the hydraulic system to deal with the increased stature might increase the hydraulic safety margin and, consequently, the resilience of taller trees in a scenario of reduced precipitation (Ambrose et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In fact, a recent study showed that taller Amazonian forests are less sensitive to precipitation variation (Giardina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), a result that contrast directly with other studies which show that larger trees suffer more during drought events in forests worldwide (Bennett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Olson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0174" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). These contrasting results highlight the uncertainties about how species with different ages and heights will respond to the increase in drought intensity and duration. In order to shed light on this controversial topic, there is an urgent need to better understand how the differences in water uptake (e.g., root density and depth) and storage capacity (e.g., trunk capacitance) between small and taller plants can impact the stability of water transport of those trees under drought conditions (Hartmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Martinez‐Vilalta, Anderegg, Sapes, &amp; Sala, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0147" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>).
