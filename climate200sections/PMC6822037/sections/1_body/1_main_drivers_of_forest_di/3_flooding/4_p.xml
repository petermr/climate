<p>Alterations in respiratory metabolism are equally important in species death under flooding conditions (Ferner et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Martínez‐Alcántara et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0146" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). These changes are largely due to the switch from aerobic to fermentative metabolism induced by the low concentration of oxygen in flooded soils (Bailey‐Serres, Lee, &amp; Brinton, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Kreuzwieser et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). As fermentation generates approximately 16 times less energy than oxidative phosphorylation, an energy deficit is expected under flooding conditions, particularly if photosynthesis is also reduced. This energy imbalance can be partially overcome through consumption of reserve materials (e.g., nonstructural carbohydrates and lipids) and/or decreases in the activity of energy‐intensive processes (e.g., nitrogen (N) assimilation and cell wall formation; Christianson, Llewellyn, Dennis, &amp; Wilson,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, depending on the flooding duration, reserve consumption can lead to carbon deprivation, making the plant even more vulnerable to this and other stresses (e.g., high temperatures and pathogen attack). Moreover, decreased reserve levels may also limit and/or increase the time required for a plant to fully recover its physiological activities (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0129" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Loreti et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), placing species inhabiting regions that undergo recurrent flooding events at even greater risk (Angelov et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). Thus, the ability to maintain a positive carbon balance appears to be one of the main determinants of the survival of species in flooding situations (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0129" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Loreti et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), even more so in a scenario that forecasts more frequent and intense flooding events (Lehmann, Coumou, &amp; Frieler,
