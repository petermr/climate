<p>Similar to the responses observed for photosynthesis, an increase in temperature also enhances 
 <italic>R</italic> rates to an optimal point, above which cell damage hinders respiration (Griffin &amp; Prager, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; O'Sullivan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0177" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The optimal temperature and thermal limit of respiration are significantly higher than those of photosynthesis (O'Sullivan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0177" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Teskey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0225" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Due to the different thermal sensitivities of these two metabolic processes, higher temperatures tend to increase the 
 <italic>R</italic>/
 <italic>A</italic> ratio, resulting in a significant reduction in daily carbon fixation (Stangler, Hamann, Kahle, &amp; Spiecker, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0218" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Zhao, Hartmann, Trumbore, Ziegler, &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0255" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In addition to reducing the amount of CO
 <sub>2</sub> fixed, exposure to high temperatures may also lead to a decrease in carbohydrate reserves (e.g., starch) in response to enhanced maintenance respiration (associated with protein turnover and membrane repair; Hüve et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35663-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Carbon balance may also be negatively affected by changes in Rubisco specificity and by reductions in CO
 <sub>2</sub> solubility relative to O
 <sub>2</sub>, a process that may increase 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>R</sub> rates (Carmo‐Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Carmo‐Silva, Scales, Madgwick, &amp; Parry, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Galmés et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Thus, even small increases in temperature can cause significant reductions in the net productivity of several plant communities, making these plants even more vulnerable to the effects of the stress factors discussed above (Adams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Liang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0130" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; McDowell &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0153" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Park Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0178" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Overall, it is clear that the increase in global mean temperature, combined with other stressors, will have a devastating effect on the productivity and composition of various plant communities and, as a result, may lead to profound changes in the global carbon cycle.
