<p>The growing increase in the atmospheric [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] is one of the main effects of anthropic activities. In fact, from the industrial revolution to the present, [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] has increased from approximately 280 to 400 ppm. If the current greenhouse gas emission pattern is maintained, [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] is expected to reach levels of 750–1,300 ppm by the end of this century (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This significant rise in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] may place a large number of species at risk because the weather extremes previously discussed are directly related to the increase in the concentration of this gaseous molecule (Becklin, Walker, Way, &amp; Ward,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0239" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, although CO
 <sub>2</sub> is considered one of the main villains of climate change, its real effect on the performance and survival of forest species remains extremely controversial (Ellsworth et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0212" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). For example, in addition to the central role of CO
 <sub>2</sub> in driving climate change, several studies have shown that higher [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] can enhance the performance and productivity of forest species (Drake et al.,
