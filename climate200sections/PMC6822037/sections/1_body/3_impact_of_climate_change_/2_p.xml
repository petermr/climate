<p>As discussed above, the interaction between multiple climatic factors can trigger tree mortality due to the disruption of central physiological processes. Despite the uncertainties regarding the intensity, frequency, and duration of those extreme weather events for the decades to come (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), even in more conservative scenario several tree species probably will be exposed to climatic conditions that differ significantly from their physiological limits (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Moreover, depending on the speed at which these stressors reach particular regions, the species inhabiting these regions may not have time to adapt to the new climatic conditions. Thus, if climate model predictions are confirmed, profound changes in the composition of several biomes can be expected (Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0242" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0251" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In fact, some studies on plant dynamics indicate that climate changes predicted for the end of this century could result in the replacement of current biomes by those that are more adapted (Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Park Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0178" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), including the replacement of the Amazon forest by savannah vegetation (Lapola, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), leading to huge losses of biodiversity (Figure
