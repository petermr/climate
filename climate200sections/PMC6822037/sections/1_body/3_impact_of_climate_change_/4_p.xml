<p>Alterations in forest composition can also result from shifts in the geographic distribution along climatic gradients (Hisano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In fact, several pieces of evidence support the latitudinal and altitudinal shifts induced by alteration in climatic conditions (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Colwell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Hisano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). As an example, expressive increments in atmospheric temperature, along with reductions in water availability, are attributed to the upward movement of trees from the lower elevation range boundaries and also to elevational range contractions in a forest from southeastern Arizona (Brusca et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Similarly, an extreme drought event in the early 2000s leads to rapid vegetation redistribution in the southern California mountains (Fellows &amp; Goulden, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). It is important to note that those shifts in plant distribution are highly species‐dependent since their environmental requirements and capacity to adapt are highly variable (Butler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Thus, in a given forest community, species that display a set of morpho‐physiological traits that confer higher tolerance to a given environmental will tend to increase their dominance, while more sensitive species tend to decay (Hisano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Moradi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0161" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). This observation highlights the central role of biodiversity in minimizing the deleterious effects of climate change on forest communities (Hisano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), since a more biodiverse system tends to be more resilient (Chapin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>; Grossiord, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Sakschewski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0197" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). This link between biodiversity and forest safety can be clearly observed in a recent study in which the diversity in hydraulic traits of trees was a central factor in mediating ecosystem resilience to drought (Anderegg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
