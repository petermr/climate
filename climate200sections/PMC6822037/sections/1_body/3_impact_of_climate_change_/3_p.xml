<p>In addition to the prediction from climatic models, changes in forest composition can be already seen in several regions around the globe. For example, a recent study had shown that the increase in drought intensity had led to a shift in species composition in forests of the eastern United States toward species that are more drought‚Äêtolerant, but with lower growth rates (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0254" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Besides the losses in biodiversity, the resulting increase in mortality rates and reduction in forest biomass accumulation might also transform the global forest ecosystems from carbon sinks to carbon sources (Brienen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Hisano, Searle, &amp; Chen,

 <xref rid="ece35663-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). This situation was already observed in forest ecosystems which are crucial to the regulation of carbon dynamics worldwide, like the Amazon forest (Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Thus, it is clear that even small changes in forest composition can have a feedback effect which might increase the concentration of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and thus the rate of climate change itself (Phillips et al.,
