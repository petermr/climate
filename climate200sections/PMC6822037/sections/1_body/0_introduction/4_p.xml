<p>In addition to the massive loss of biodiversity, the increase in forest death events can also promote profound changes in global carbon and water cycles (Frank et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Indeed, as forests cover significant portions of the Earth's surface, and because they contribute to a large portion of primary carbon sequestration and water cycling, even minor environmental changes can disturb the complex dynamics of the terrestrial biosphere (Yan, Zhong, &amp; Shangguan, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0247" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Examples of such disturbances can be seen in recent studies that point to the widespread reduction in carbon sequestration in several regions of the globe, both in tropical and in temperate ecosystems (Doughty et al.,
