  <p>The controversial role of CO
   <sub>2</sub>. High [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] can stimulate plant growth through the increase in CO
   <sub>2</sub>/O
   <sub>2</sub> ratio inside the chloroplasts, which enhance photosynthesis (
   <italic>A</italic>) and reduce photorespiration (
   <italic>P</italic>
   <sub>R</sub>), besides contributing to the increase in water use efficiency (WUE), as a result of reduced stomatal conductance (
   <italic>g</italic>
   <sub>s</sub>), thus minimizing the deleterious effect of some abiotic stresses. On the other hand, the fertilizer effect of high [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] is not always observed or only transitory, as a result of the downregulation of 
   <italic>A</italic>, which is related to carbohydrate accumulation, repression of photosynthetic genes, and lower availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Moreover, some morphological and morpho‚Äêanatomical changes induced by high [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] may also enhance the vulnerability of tree species to abiotic stresses, as a result of increased transpiration, reduced water uptake, increased vulnerability to cavitation, and higher respiration (
   <italic>R</italic>) and photorespiration (
   <italic>P</italic>
   <sub>R</sub>) rates. High [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] can also compromise the interactions between plants and their pollinators, through phenology changes
