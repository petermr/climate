  <result pre="2.1 Drought One of the main factors commonly associated with" exact="forest" post="dieback events under drought conditions is the carbon starvation"/>

  <result pre="in order to better predict the impact of drought on" exact="forest" post="communities, it is essential to unravel the uncertainties about"/>

  <result pre="of drought events appears to be a predominant factor in" exact="forest" post="dieback events, yet it is rarely taken into account"/>
  <result pre="events. Finally, another factor that can increase the vulnerability of" exact="forest" post="ecosystems in a scenario of reduced precipitation is the"/>
  <result pre="the vulnerability from fire‐tolerant species, resulting in drastic changes in" exact="forest" post="composition and loss of biodiversity (Henzler, Weise, Enright, Zander,"/>

  <result pre="shown that a widespread mortality event in a tropical dry" exact="forest" post="from Mexico was related to an unusual combination of"/>
  <result pre="the large temperature fluctuations, can significantly increase the vulnerability of" exact="forest" post="species in virtually all biomes. 3 THE CONTROVERSIAL ROLE"/>

  <result pre="In addition to the prediction from climatic models, changes in" exact="forest" post="composition can be already seen in several regions around"/>
  <result pre="biodiversity, the resulting increase in mortality rates and reduction in" exact="forest" post="biomass accumulation might also transform the global forest ecosystems"/>
  <result pre="reduction in forest biomass accumulation might also transform the global" exact="forest" post="ecosystems from carbon sinks to carbon sources (Brienen et"/>
  <result pre="Chen, 2018) (Figure 4c). This situation was already observed in" exact="forest" post="ecosystems which are crucial to the regulation of carbon"/>

  <result pre="range boundaries and also to elevational range contractions in a" exact="forest" post="from southeastern Arizona (Brusca et al., 2013). Similarly, an"/>

  <result pre="(Anderegg et al., 2018). Another concern regarding the changes in" exact="forest" post="composition is related to tree recruitment since drastic changes"/>
