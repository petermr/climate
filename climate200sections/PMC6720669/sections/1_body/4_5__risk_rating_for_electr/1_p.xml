<p>As climate change accelerates, more frequent disasters are occurring. Electrical equipment is often installed outdoors, and if such electrical equipment is affected by natural disasters, they can have a significant impact on society. Therefore, efforts are needed to increase the resistance of electrical equipment to natural disasters that can be caused by climate change. Accidents in electrical equipment result from various internal and external causes. However, since the electrical equipment is mainly installed outside, it is affected by various climatic conditions (heat, heavy rain, heavy snow, etc.). Even in the case of the indoor equipment, it cannot be considered to be independent of climate various due to the abrupt load change and interlocking with outdoor facility.</p>
