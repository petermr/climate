 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02984-f021">Figure 21</xref> shows an electrical fire risk matrix indicating the prediction of the risk level for electrical fires by each type of equipment on a monthly basis. Similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02984-f017">Figure 17</xref>, the redder the color in the matrix, the higher the risk is. On the other hand, the more yellow the color is, the lower the risk is. The accident rate of all types of equipment is high in July and MCCB accidents happen frequently in January compared to other types of equipment. With the 10 years of data, in addition to the annual update, the accuracy of this matrix model will increase.
