<p>We first presented a statistical analysis of electrical fires on a monthly basis associated with various regional (metropolitan city) climatic conditions (temperature, humidity). Next, we presented an electrical fire risk rating for each different region and each type of equipment. Based on the risk rating analysis for each region and type of equipment, we presented risk matrix diagrams to visualize the likelihood of electrical fires by each region in any month of the year or the likelihood of electrical accidents by each type of electric equipment in any month of the year. Since this matrix diagram is based on 10 years of statistical data, it is possible to forecast approximately the risk level of electrical fires or accidents beyond that period. Such a prediction will be more accurate as the data accumulates annually accumulates.</p>
