<p>Abnormal climate phenomena appear in every corner of the world due to global warming, resulting in not only melting glaciers and rising sea levels but increasing the frequency of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and typhoons. Abnormal climate has led to a situation where human life as well as the ecosystem is threatened. Because of global warming triggered by the increased use of fossil fuels with the industrial development, the climate is changing the environment such that extremely cold and hot temperatures are deepened and the frequency and intensity of lightning and typhoons are increased, which adversely affects electrical equipment [

Abnormal climate phenomena such as sea level rise and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns due to continuous climate change are increasingly affecting various living environments and systems such as ecosystems, transportation, energy supply and demand, and infrastructure [
