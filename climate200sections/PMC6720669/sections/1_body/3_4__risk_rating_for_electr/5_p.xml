<p>If this matrix is made based on 10 years (from 2011 to 2019) of statistical data, it can be predicted that the risk level of any area in any month of the next year after that period will be similar to that of this matrix. For example, in 2020, most regions are predicted to have a high fire risk level from July to August and December to January. The risk level for electrical fires in Gangwon is likely to be particularly high through the entire year compared to other regions.</p>
