 <p>Lay Summary.</p>
 <p>How climate change impacts animal extended phenotypes (EPs) is poorly understood. We modelled how temperature and humidity affects the ability of spider webs to intercept prey. We found humidity had negative effects at the extremes. Temperature, however, likely interacts with humidity to affect web tension and prey retention.</p>
