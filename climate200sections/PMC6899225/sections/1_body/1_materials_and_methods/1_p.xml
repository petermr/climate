<p>For our dynamic model, we used the mean web geometric parameters reported for ‘large frame’ webs built by the orb-web spider 
 <italic>Argiope radon</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Harmer 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>). We selected this species because it has the most complete and, accordingly, most reliable data set available for modelling purposes (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Harmer 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>), and it is closely related to the most common summer-active orb-web spider from Sydney, 
 <italic>Argiope keyserlingi</italic>. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are many studies on the material properties of various spider silks, and the values reported may vary considerably. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Blamires 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2012
 </xref>) collected the values for MA silk for 10 orb-web species from Taiwan and showed a variation of 232–909 MPa for ultimate strength, 47–202 MJ m
 <sup>−3</sup> for toughness and 3.4–10.7 GPa for Young’s modulus (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Blamires 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). These value ranges might mask the variation found within a single web, e.g. 2.6–7.0 GPa for the Young’s moduli of radial, frame and mooring threads (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Alam 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>), as well as likely variation due to methodological differences and collection protocols, for instance between forcible silking and web-collected silks (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Blamires 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>).
