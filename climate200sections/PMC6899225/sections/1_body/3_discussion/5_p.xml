<p>Extreme climate change predictions posit a decrease in humidity of ~4% RH in and around Sydney (
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Webb and Hennessy, 2015</xref>). Our model showed that web function is negatively affected under extreme high- or low-humidity scenarios. We nonetheless do not expect a fall of 4% RH to adversely affect the functionality of spider webs in Sydney. Notwithstanding, the functionality of 
 <italic>Argiope</italic> webs is improved if they are built at high (&gt;70%) humidity (as occurs during the morning or evening), as supercontraction of the radial silks enhances the webâ€™s tension and compliance, hence its capacity to absorb the kinetic energy imparted by flying prey (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Boutry and Blackledge, 2013</xref>). It thus may be reasonable to predict that the performance of 
 <italic>Argiope</italic> webs might be detrimentally impacted by climate change if the morning and/or evening humidity decreases substantially during the summer.
