<p>There are a multitude of practical reasons, which we outlined in the Introduction, why there are not any comparative empirical studies of web performance across the temperature and humidity ranges tested herein. Accordingly, our findings should be considered primarily illustrative but nonetheless important. We expect that the data from which they are founded is robust enough to draw conclusions about the functionality of real-world spider webs under changing climate scenarios. We therefore conclude that humidity has a more direct effect on the performance of spider webs in a changing climate, but temperature could interact with humidity in additional ways to affect prey retention.</p>
