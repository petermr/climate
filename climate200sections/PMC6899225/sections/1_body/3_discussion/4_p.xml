<p>The temperature range used in our models exceeded even the worst-case scenario climate change projections (
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Schneider, 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, we considered it necessary to fully assess the dynamics of web property variability as temperatures rapidly change over a wide range to be able to predict the values that pertain to actual climate change scenarios. For instance, in and around Sydney, extreme climate change predictions have annual temperatures increasing by ~ 5°C by 2090, while humidity is predicted to decrease by ~ 4%RH (
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Webb and Hennessy, 2015</xref>). More significantly, the number of days per year that exceeds 35°C will profoundly increase (
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Webb and Hennessy, 2015</xref>). Our modelling herein, along with previous work (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Blamires 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2012
 </xref>), has shown that radial threads become brittle and liable to easily break when exposed to temperatures over 35°C for several consecutive days. If extreme climate change scenarios are realized, then the functionality of 
 <italic>Argiope</italic> webs will undoubtedly be negatively affected. Given that the particular species for which our model was developed (
 <italic>A. radon</italic> and 
 <italic>A. keyserlingi</italic>) are broadly distributed throughout Australia, any populations outside of Sydney may experience different climate change scenarios which could influence the properties of these spider’s webs differently.
