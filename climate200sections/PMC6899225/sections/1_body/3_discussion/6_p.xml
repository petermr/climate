 </xref>), the models presented here are just examples of the broader findings that might be expected. We used some common material and web geometry values rather than any specified values for a given spider species in a specific environment. There is a great deal of variation in all the parameters that make up the model, and to properly evaluate the effects on a particular species would require us to produce a set of species and environment-specific cases. There is nevertheless scope for increasing the realism of the model. The material properties of real spider silks are complex, and the effects of moderate environmental changes are largely unknown. Added to this complexity is the fact that orb webs are rarely constructed as a uniform plane, and the properties such as web size, mesh height and the number of, and angles between, radial threads are not the same across different web sectors (

Moreover, the impacts that prey impart on webs are more complex than a simple projectile with directed variations in speed, direction, mass and surface area. There are important effects imparted by aerodynamic forces as well as complex speed dependent stress-strain relationships for the individual silks that make up the web. In addition, because of the non-linear nature of MA silk, a thread either breaks if its breaking strain is exceeded or it does not if the breaking strain is not exceeded. We thus potentially have multiple cliff-edge scenarios when even small changes may lead to catastrophic effects in some situations. All factors accordingly need to be properly explored further to fully quantify the probable effects of particular climate change scenarios.
