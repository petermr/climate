<p>We found measurable effects for all the parameter manipulations we tried. The effects of temperature alone were relatively small as would be expected from the small percentage changes in material properties they would be expected to generate. However, because both breaking strain and mean stiffness decrease at high temperatures (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Guess and Viney, 1998</xref>), these factors would act together to reduce the overall toughness of the material. While prey capture success rates are not affected, web damage is greater with higher temperatures leading to higher strains as a proportion of breaking strain and a higher number of thread breakages. The effects due to humidity were nevertheless more prominent, as predicted from the much larger numerical effects on the material properties inputted. Because the effects of temperature and humidity on stiffness and breaking strain are in opposite directions, we might expect a complex picture to emerge. This is indeed the case, and we see that dramatic shifts in both factors lead to much poorer web performance. Webs at low humidity were projected to have a poor capture performance, although the high-humidity scenario also performed poorly with most projectiles passing through the web. The poor capture performance at low and high humidity leads to extensive web damage with marginally worse performance under the low-humidity scenario. The reduced stopping success of the web is clearly due to the reduced strain energy capacity of the silks due to the alterations in their stiffness and breaking strain. These predictions, however, depend on the precise values used in the model and, as noted earlier, there is considerable variation in the values reported in the literature. The values used herein, taken from 
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">Plaza et al. (2006</xref>), show an 8-fold increase in the maximum strain and a 30-fold reduction in the mean stiffness over the range of humidities they tested (
 <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). With a linear model, this means that the toughness reduces by a factor of 3.8. However, data on the effects of silk supercontraction at high humidities suggest that in some situations, the overall toughness (hence resistance to breaking under prey impact) increases (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Boutry and Blackledge, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Vehoff 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2007
 </xref>) showed a 1.2-fold reduction in toughness for 
 <italic>Nephila senegalensis</italic> at high humidity but a 1.3-fold increase for 
 <italic>Nephila clavipes</italic>, illustrating the complex nature of the interaction between stiffness and breaking strain even among closely related species. These discrepancies all illustrate the difficulties of trying to generalize from a single model and the problems of using inconsistent data sources as well as modelling spider silk as a linear spring. Ideally, all the required modelling parameters should be measured in a uniform fashion for a range of species with uncertainties and variation explored using sensitivity analysis (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Campolongo 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2000
 </xref>), but this is a major undertaking and beyond the scope of this paper.
