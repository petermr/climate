<p>The mechanical performance of the MA silks within spider orb webs are non-linear, i.e. they undergo initial softening up to a yield point whereupon the silk substantially stiffens until reaching a modestly large strain of failure (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2012
 </xref>). Indeed, the dynamic non-linear material property of MA silk is identified as a critical aspect of the web’s ability to intercept prey (

 </xref>). Similarly, the geometrical properties of the web, such as fibre diameter, are not uniform and likely to be functionally important (Jyoti 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 2018). We used a multibody dynamic model here rather than Finite Element Analysis (FEA) (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>), as it copes with the non-linear, large strain properties of silk better than FEA (

Moreover, web pretension can be adjusted to account for the compounding effects of web tension under different temperature and humidity scenarios in addition to the silk’s impact absorption properties. Again, supercontraction may be important since there is evidence that it greatly increases web tension (
