<p>The dynamic and interactive interplay between temperature and humidity on the stickiness of spider webs, and the variability in responsiveness across species of spider, renders modelling prey retention across changing temperature and humidity particularly complex. A similar dynamic model as that used herein might be utilized to test spiral thread adhesiveness across the same temperature and humidity ranges, but additional parameters such as spiral spacing, spiral thread length, the extensibility, adhesiveness and damping of the spiral threads and any interactions therein, need to be experimentally derived or attained from the literature for inclusion in the model (
