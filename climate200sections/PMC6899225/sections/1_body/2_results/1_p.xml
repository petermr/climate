<p>The simulations were run for a 500-ms duration from a position where the projectile was a few millimetres from contact with the web. 
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the forward and vertical components of the trajectory following impact with the web. The ability of the web to stop the projectile is not impaired across the different temperature scenarios, but under high humidity, the projectile passes through the web in all cases and in almost all cases under low humidity. These results show that in this case, temperature alone has little effect on prey capture, but that the effect of humidity can be extreme with both low and high humidity having potentially deleterious effects on prey capture.
