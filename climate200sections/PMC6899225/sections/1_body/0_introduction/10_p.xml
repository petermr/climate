<p>Here we used a multibody dynamic model that uses reported properties of spider MA silk to test whether the ability of spider orb webs to capture prey are likely to become affected by climate change. We created simulations of a projectile (representing a flying insect) hitting a web and varied the material properties of the web over a temperature range of 20–55°C and a humidity range of 15–100%. The outputs of the model across the temperature and humidity ranges tested were then used to make predictions about the likely future web performances of summer active spiders from around Sydney under extreme climate change scenarios.</p>
