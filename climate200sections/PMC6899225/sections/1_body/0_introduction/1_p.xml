<p>Animal phenotypic features, whether they are morphological, biochemical or behavioural features, can vary plastically across environments as a consequence of the interplay between genetic and environmental influences (Schneider, 1993;

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2004
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Borges, 2008</xref>). It is generally thought that plasticity in specific traits enhances Darwinian fitness by enabling an organism to retain critical functionality across environments (

 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Borges, 2008</xref>). Some organisms construct phenotypic features ‘beyond the body’ (

 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Waite and Broomell, 2012</xref>). These features have been called ‘external organs’ (
 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">Turner, 2000</xref>) or, more commonly, ‘extended phenotypes’ (EPs) (

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Blamires, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Bailey, 2012</xref>). EPs are not only physical constructs, such as spider webs, beaver dams, midge-induced plant galls, worm burrows and termite mounds, but anything that exerts indirect genetic effects (

 </xref>; DiRienzo and Aonuma, 2019), how plasticity in EP constructs affect the fitness of organisms across environments is not well known (
