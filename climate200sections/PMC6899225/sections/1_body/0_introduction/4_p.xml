<p>The influence of temperature and/or humidity on the performance of EP constructs is nonetheless not well understood, rendering it extremely difficult to make meaningful predictions about the impacts of climate change on the fitness of the animals that build them. Temperature might affect the biomechanical properties of EP constructs in one or both of the following ways: (i) exceeding the builderâ€™s upper thermal tolerance limit, i.e. its critical thermal maximum, thus impeding its ability to produce the materials from which the EP is constructed and/or to fashion the materials into a functional construct; (ii) directly affecting the structural integrity of the EP and/or the molecular integrity of the material from which it is manufactured (
