<p>Simulations using finite element, dynamic and analogous models are becoming increasingly utilized for resolving complex problems and making detailed predictions in biological engineering based on the properties of the structural elements (

 </xref>), and this works well for modelling the material deformation and contact interactions. However, an alternative approach is multibody dynamic analysis (
