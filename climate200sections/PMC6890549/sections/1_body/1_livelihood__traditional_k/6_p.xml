<p>In response to drought, households have developed a vast storehouse of knowledge on prediction and early warning signs that help them to prepare and manage drought effectively, even sometimes relocating whenever possible. As discussed earlier, there are diverse ways that individuals or households are influenced to adopt particular response strategies. In the field of prediction and early warning of disasters, communities in Kenya have a large number of climate monitoring indicators that enable them to know when it is the right time to start planting in anticipation of the rains or to preserve and store food in anticipation of a dry season (Mwaura 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>:21). These indicators include observation of the behaviour of animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, vegetation and trees, winds, temperatures and celestial bodies, such as the size of the moon and stars (Mwaura 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>:21). When a drought is predicted, the community devises strategies that may help them weather the shocks brought about by these disasters. Amongst the most common strategies are building stores and savings which could assist as a fallback (Chen
