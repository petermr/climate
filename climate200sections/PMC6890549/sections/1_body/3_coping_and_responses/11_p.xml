<p>Oelofse and Dodson (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), while examining poor rural households of the northern province of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, where restructuring of old age pensions has led to some pensioners being removed from the pension roll, found different coping mechanisms that have been employed as a result of this sudden shock. Households that had family networks, such as working children, and households which had savings and small businesses and were not fully reliant on pension money, were less vulnerable than households that had no family ties or reserves. The latter group was forced into a series of coping mechanisms such as borrowing or cutting back on food intake or taking children out of school. These actions made the households even more vulnerable.
