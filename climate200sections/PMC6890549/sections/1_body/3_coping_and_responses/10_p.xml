<p>During times of drought, as well as famine that occur as a result of drought, parents who have family in unaffected areas send their children to their relatives to be cared for (Rahmato 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>:167). Peasants may travel long distances to remote areas unaffected by the drought to borrow food from a relative, a friend or someone with whom such arrangements can be made (Rahmato 1999:167). Brewing beer is also an important source of income, especially for rural women, as a reduction in grain ingredients caused by drought can affect their income and nutrition.
