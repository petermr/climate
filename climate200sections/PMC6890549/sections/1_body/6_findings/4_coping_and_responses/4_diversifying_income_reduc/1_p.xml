<p>During times of uncertainty, communities in the study area engage in a number of activities. Evidences from group discussions revealed that there are very few opportunities in the areas, however, during drought, communities engage in small businesses, such as selling fat-cakes and other small items. During group discussions, it emerged that many participants were engaged in the business of selling basic items, such as sugar, soaps, chips and sweet. These have been identified by all participants as an alternative to escape the effects of drought. However, this strategy presents many weaknesses and limitations. One is that most of the households have no source of income to start such small business. For instance, one old woman claimed that she has never received more than R100 in the last 10 years. Another problem is that there are no formal markets where these items can be sold. Those engaged in this form of diversification have to market their product door-to-door, and in some instances sell to passers-by. This proved to be a difficult exercise for many of the participants.</p>
