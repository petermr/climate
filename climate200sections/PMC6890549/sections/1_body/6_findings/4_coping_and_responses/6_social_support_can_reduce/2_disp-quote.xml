 <p>I have no other source of income. I only rely on my daughter who is working in Durban as a domestic worker. Sometimes, she doesnâ€™t get the money on time, because her boss did not pay her. If it happens, then we have to struggle and find other ways. Sometimes we borrow food stuff[s] from a local shop dealer, when my daughter send[s] us the money, then we pay the shop dealer.
