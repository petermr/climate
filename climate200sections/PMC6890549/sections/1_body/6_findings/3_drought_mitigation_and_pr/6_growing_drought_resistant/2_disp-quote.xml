 <p>Every year we are experiencing crop failure as [a] result of the lack of rain. Some species of crops which used to be grown are no longer grown as they cannot resist … the dry conditions. As you can see, there is no crop that can be grown in a very dry place like this. If we should have water, it could have helped, but we do not have water to replace the rain that we do not have, if the government could bring us some water, that would help a lot, as we can grow crops even when there is no rain. The only crops that can resist … dry conditions are sorghum and sweet potatoes, but people here do not like potatoes, you cannot eat potatoes every day.
