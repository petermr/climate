 <p>It is rare to see a wild dog around the houses searching for food. When you see a wild dog coming around the houses looking for food, then know that will be a bad year. You will hear them crying around the houses and fighting with domestic dogs for food. (Participant 4, male, head of the household, age 42)</p>
