 <p>Cattle will lose weight as grass is dying. There will be foreign animals migrating to the areas and some indigenous animals will migrate elsewhere. You will always see goats and cows walking around houses and sometimes coming inside the houses and you will see some becoming very weak and canâ€™t go far to look for grass. When we observe all these signs, then we will know that drought is close to us. (Participant 1, male, head of the household, age 40)</p>
