 <p>When drought conditions are about to happen, you will always see the wind changing direction. Sometimes it is windy for a long period of time. For example it can be windy for three or six days successively, and when that happens, then we will know that drought is about to occur. (Participant 1, male, head of household, age 40)</p>
