<p>The Msinga local municipality is located in the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal. Msinga is predominantly mountainous, with rolling hills, loose stones and rocks, which make it difficult for farming. According to the Institute of Natural Resources (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), only 40% of the land has the potential for farming, but subsistence farming remains the major economic activity in the area. Added to this is the limited capacity of the land for productive agricultural development due to poor soil quality, adverse climatic conditions and poor agricultural practices, such as overgrazing (Msinga Local Municipality 2004 â€“ Integrated Development Plan 2004/2005). Despite the large irrigation potential covering up to 40% of agriculture practice, the area is subjected to water shortages, high soil erosion and low land carrying capacity (Institute of Natural Resources
