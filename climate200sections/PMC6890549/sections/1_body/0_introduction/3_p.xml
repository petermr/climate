<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the traditional or indigenous knowledge of members of a rural community in Msinga in relation to drought. Mwaura (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>:21) defines traditional and indigenous knowledge as ‘specific systems of knowledge and practice, developed and accumulated over generations within a particular cultural group and region, and as such are unique to that group and region’. The International Institute for Rural Reconstruction (IIRR) (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>:7) considers indigenous knowledge as that knowledge ‘that people in a given community have developed over time, and continue to develop, based on experience, often tested over centuries of use, adapted to local culture and environment, which are dynamic and changing’. Analysing traditional knowledge in this context, enables it to be understood as a tool and a combination of skills that help communities or households to withstand uncertainty, and adjust to changes in living conditions (Mwaura 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Potteir, Bicker and Sillitoe (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>:21) are convinced that traditional and indigenous knowledge play a central role in developing the self-reliance of a society or community, and have been recognised as important by many disciplines in the development sector. In relation to communities’ indigenous disaster management strategies, Save the Children UK (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) clearly understands traditional knowledge as one that needs to take into account the daily survival strategies of the communities, as this enables one to make sense of the complex ways in which individuals, households and communities achieve and sustain their livelihoods, as well as the likely impact of an external shock on such communities. Thus, understanding traditional and indigenous knowledge fits into the broader reconstruction and development of strategies in South Africa. It provides a new platform for self-discovery. Problems are identified, and solutions are built on knowledge of grassroots communities (Okumu
