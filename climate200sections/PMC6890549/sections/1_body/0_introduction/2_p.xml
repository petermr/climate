<p>A study conducted by the Institute of Natural Resources in 2007 reveals that Msinga is characterised by an annual rainfall of between 600 mm and 700 mm. In terms of international standards, this indicates drought of a high magnitude (Institute of Natural Resources 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The South African Weather Services (KwaZulu-Natal Station, pers. comm., June 2008) demonstrates that the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal, which includes Msinga, is prone to dry conditions. The changing nature of rainfall in most areas of Msinga makes it risky to invest in the production of crops, such as maize, vegetables and sorghum, which are the main sources of food in these areas. Msinga suffers intermittent and periodic droughts, with the last officially recorded drought occurring in 2004 (Drought Information Bulletin 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, despite the drought, the findings of this study showed that the communities in Msinga, in particular, continue to experience the effects of drought after this period, and its affects are severe (Personal interviews with members of Msinga). The researcher at the Maurice Webb Race Relations Unit (MWRRU 2006) supported the above argument by reporting that Msinga has high levels of illiteracy, reaching up to 79%. In his study he adds that 95% of households in the area rely on wood as fuel for cooking which places a burden on the already vulnerable environment. Drought conditions in Msinga are aggravated by the prevailing economic and social situation in the area. Therefore, there is no doubt that droughts have caused complex socio-economic consequences for members of Msinga communities and trigger vulnerability in the livelihood of these communities.
