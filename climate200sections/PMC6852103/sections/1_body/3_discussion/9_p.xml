<p>While seabed warming has had a largely positive demographic effect on lobster in the Gulf of Maine, this has not been true for the southern segment of the population. South of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, entirely different oceanography and thermogeography results in warming temperatures exceeding the 20°C upper threshold and has been associated with physiological stress, rising prevalence of epizootic disease (e.g., Castro &amp; Angell,

 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), and with mass mortalities (Pearce &amp; Balcom, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The widespread mortality in southern New England contributed to the reduced reproductive potential and settlement (Wahle, Dellinger, Olszewski, &amp; Jekielek, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Southwestern‐most parts of the Gulf of Maine occasionally exceed 20°C, but these periods are relatively short in comparison to southern New England where regions can exceed this threshold for over 2 months (Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Northeastern parts of the Gulf of Maine rarely exceed this upper threshold, and the relatively stable thermal regime may buffer this part of the Gulf of Maine from lobster declines related to excessive future warming. Poleward migration of other taxa including predatory fishes will have unknown impacts on American lobsters (Nye et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Nevertheless, our understanding of the role of climate change on marine organism distribution requires a better understanding of important details of both the oceanographic and organism attributes.
