<p>These results, however, fail to directly support or refute the thermally mediated dilution hypothesis. Observations from ALSI deep‐water settlement collectors, ventless trap surveys, and inshore trawl surveys do not yet provide a direct test of the thermally mediated dilution hypothesis. Although Maine lobster landings have shown signs of leveling off since 2013, consistent with the onset of declines in shallow water settlement density after 2008, ongoing fishery independent surveys, such as ventless trap surveys and inshore trawl surveys have failed to reveal declines in sublegal lobsters that might have been expected to lead the landings decline. These surveys appear to corroborate an increase in abundance across life stages at depths exceeding 25 and 50 m (Sherman, Stepanek, Pierce, Tetrault, &amp; O'Donnell,

However, these methods may introduce their own biases related to the interaction between warming waters and lobster catchability causing annual patterns to potentially misrepresent recruitment strength. Continued multilife stage monitoring over a full range of depths is, therefore, necessary to confirm how settlement and movements of postsettlement stages relate to water column thermal properties.
