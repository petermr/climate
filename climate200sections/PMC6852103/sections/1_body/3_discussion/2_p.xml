<p>We illustrated that lobster landings have been increasing for decades with the greatest expansion in northeastern Maine (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). This is consistent with studies of climate velocities attributed to rising ocean temperatures (Pinsky et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and contrasting rates of landings increase in the Gulf of Maine. However, often, the mechanisms driving these changes in distribution are unknown or difficult to quantitate. SST, used in most studies of climate–fisheries interactions (e.g., Pershing et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), offer generalized trends in ocean conditions. It is only when we couple these trends to biological thresholds that we get closer to process‐level understanding and improve our predictive capability. We considered warming in the context of thermally mediated lobster settlement behavior (Annis, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). It is influenced by the strong tidal mixing in the northeast region of the Gulf of Maine (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and we offer a mechanistic explanation for an economically important species that has been shown to have settlement‐driven demography (e.g., Incze et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Palma et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Wahle &amp; Incze, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>).
