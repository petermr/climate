<p>We demonstrated that the impacts of climate change are spatially variable in the Gulf of Maine due to local oceanographic conditions that change the susceptibility of nearshore areas to warming. Northeastern Gulf of Maine warming is largely uncoupled to synoptic conditions due to strong tidal mixing (Mountain et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>), and is most likely driven by offshore advective components of heat flux. However, interannual variability in surface heat flux in southwestern Gulf of Maine is highly correlated with local heat flux due to the importance of stratification in this region (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These local oceanographic conditions have resulted in uneven warming rates across the Gulf of Maine and the degree to which warming influences the seabed (Kavanaugh et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As a consequence, thermogeographic patterns of YoY lobster recruitment have followed the patterns of benthic warming.
