<p>The State of Maine lobster fishery has one of the longest time series of lobster landings in the world dating back to 1880 (MDMR, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). To the extent that landings (integrated over several years) are a reliable predictor of lobster population size (Steneck &amp; Wilson, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), these historical data help us identify population trends over the past century. Maine landings were used to identify the time frame over which landings have changed. To compare landing trends from areas with very different coastline lengths along the coast of the Gulf of Maine, landings over this time frame were standardized per unit length of coastline (e.g., Steneck &amp; Wilson,
