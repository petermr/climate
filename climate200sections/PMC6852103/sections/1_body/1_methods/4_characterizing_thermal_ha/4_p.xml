<p>We also used data from Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) buoys to evaluate the relationship between observed surface and bottom temperatures in the northeastern and southwestern Gulf of Maine. As a component of NERACOOS, the University of Maine Physical Oceanography Group develops, operates, and manages the Gulf of Maine buoy array that was founded in 1999 as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System. Data were collected from two buoys that are approximately equidistant from the mouth of Penobscot Bay (I01: Northeast of Penobscot Bay, LAT: 44.10, LON: −68.10 and E01: Southwest of Penobscot Bay, LAT: 43.71, LON: −69.35). These locations were chosen because they represent the stratification differences between the two regions in the Gulf of Maine. We compared daily average surface (1 m) and bottom (50 m) water temperatures over the lobster settlement season (August–October) from 2001 to 2017. The least‐squares regression of surface‐to‐bottom temperatures and a two‐tailed 
 <italic>t</italic> test assuming unequal variances on the mean surface‐to‐bottom temperature differences were performed to determine water column thermal structure and the magnitude of the southwest‐to‐northeast difference. We also compared daily surface (1 m) and bottom (50 m) buoy temperatures to modeled NECOFS temperatures at the nearest corresponding sigma layer depth by least‐squares regressions from 2001 to 2015.
