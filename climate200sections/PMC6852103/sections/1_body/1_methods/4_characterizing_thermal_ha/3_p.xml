<p>Daily bottom temperature output was collected during the lobster settlement season (August–October) from 1978 to 2015. Daily bottom temperatures were averaged over the lobster settlement season (August–October) per grid node per year. Average grid temperatures were calculated as the average seasonal temperature of the grid's nodes. The area of bottom habitat per grid were determined by using node depth via the USGS 15‐arcsec digital bathymetry dataset (Roworth &amp; Signell,

The annual bottom area of suitable thermal habitat (≥12°C; Annis,
