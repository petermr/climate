<p>On the strength of the inverse relationship between YoY density and area of thermally suitable habitat, we generated two additional indices of YoY abundance, which extrapolate YoY density over areas of a thermally suitable seabed in different ways. The first assumes uniform settlement across depths shallower than 50 m (Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; see above). In this case, extrapolated recruitment, 
 <italic>R</italic>, was taken as the product of YoY settlement density, 
 <italic>ρ</italic> , from shallow diver‐sampled locations and the area, 
 <italic>A</italic>, of thermally suitable sea bed subject to temperatures &gt;12°C:
