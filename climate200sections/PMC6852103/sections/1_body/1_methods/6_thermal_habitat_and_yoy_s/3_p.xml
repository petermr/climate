<p>We estimated the depth over which lobster settlement is relatively homogenous by reanalyzing data from Wahle, Bergeron, et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Our analysis focused on data from the northeastern Gulf of Maine where temperature was uniform across depths and was unlikely to influence depth‐wise patterns of settlement. We standardized annual settlement densities over the three depth strata (0–25, 25–50, and 50–100 m) to shallow settlement densities over the study period (2007–2008). We then performed a one‐way ANOVA and Tukey–Kramer post hoc test to determine the depth at which settlement density significantly deviated from shallow settlement densities. Based on this analysis, we chose 50 m as the limit for the relatively uniform distribution of YoY lobster over suitable thermal habitats (Figure
