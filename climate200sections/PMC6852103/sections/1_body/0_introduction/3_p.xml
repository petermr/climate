<p>We focus on the American lobster (
 <italic>Homarus americanus</italic> Milne Edwards) because it is the most valuable single‐species fishery in North America, with a combined value of more than $US 1.67 billion in 2016 (DFO,

 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1923</xref>) surmised that despite thriving lobster fisheries, the absence of juvenile lobster in the Bay of Fundy and northeastern Gulf of Maine could be attributed to the colder waters preventing larval development and settlement. Studies over the last three decades determined that the demography of this species is driven by the successful settlement of its pelagic postlarval stage on the seabed (Barshaw &amp; Bryant‐Rich,
