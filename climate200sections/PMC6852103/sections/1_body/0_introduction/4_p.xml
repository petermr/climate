<p>Thermal thresholds act in ways that directly impact species fitness and demographic processes. The 12°C threshold for lobster indicates a point at which colder temperatures induce lethal (e.g., irregular respiration and heartbeat; Quinn, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and sublethal (increased time spent in the plankton: MacKenzie, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>; behavioral avoidance and decreased size at molt: Annis, Wilson, Russell, &amp; Yund, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) effects. Small temperature changes about this threshold correspond with large changes in survival and settlement which decouples larval supply from settlement patterns (Annis et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Thus, the 12°C threshold can act as an ecological barrier to larval transport (Tilburg, McCartney, &amp; Yund, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and survival. Ocean warming, therefore, has the potential to significantly impact the distribution and survival of lobster larvae. This is especially the case in the Gulf of Maine where end‐of‐century projections suggest an expanded area and time the seabed spends above the thermal threshold (Rheuban, Kavanaugh, &amp; Doney, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
