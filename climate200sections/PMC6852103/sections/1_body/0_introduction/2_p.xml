<p>Global climate change is an information dense, but deceptively complicated, phrase. Most of the world's oceans are warming, but patterns in the distribution, abundance, and rate of warming varies in space, time, and in ways that can have profound effects on marine organisms (Kleisner et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Pinsky, Worm, Fogarty, Sarmiento, &amp; Levin, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Several studies have recorded the "climate velocity" of the net poleward shifts in the distribution of marine organisms that are commercially fished (Nye, Link, Hare, &amp; Overholtz, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Pinsky et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) or ecologically important to marine ecosystems (such as coral reef fish: Verg√©s et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; and kelp forests: Wernberg et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, to assess the effects of ocean warming requires understanding how those aspects of climate change affect organisms where they live. Most studies use trends in sea surface temperature (SST) as a convenient and important measure of local warming (e.g., Pershing et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), but such remote sensing metrics may not be indicative of exposure for organisms with key life history processes occurring on or near the seabed. Such is the case of the northwest Atlantic coastal and shelf waters where thermal properties of sea temperature vary dramatically in time and space (Kavanaugh, Rheuban, Luis, &amp; Doney,
