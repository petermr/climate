 </sup> is reflected in changes in species distribution (including latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal changes), phenology, invasions, changes in populations, loss of genetic diversity and extinction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. The threats to biodiversity produced by climate change are magnified by increased fragmentation of natural habitats and regional introduction of new species and diseases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. In order to have a clearer perspective on biodiversity losses and extinctions as we have moved into the Anthropocene
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup> we need to understand the multiple components of climate that drive biodiversity loss, including past changes in regional and local temperatures, precipitation and extreme events
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Here, a regional focus is crucial as species-range reduction, population loss, species invasions and extinctions are spatially heterogeneous

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
