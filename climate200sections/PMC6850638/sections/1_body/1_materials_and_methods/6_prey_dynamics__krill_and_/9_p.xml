<p>To explore how krill in our model could respond to changes in the environment and food availability, we first collated a summary of known direct responses of krill to changes in physical parameters (changing SST; changes in sea‐ice extent, duration and thickness; productivity‐driven variability; increasing CO
 <sub>2</sub> and ocean acidification; and UV/irradiance), based on experimental and observational literature (Table

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>; Quetin, Ross, &amp; Clarke, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). Although the intensity of impacts from environmental change on krill is spatially heterogeneous, experimental and observational studies agree that a rise in SST beyond the threshold of krill survival (~4°C) will consistently result in high krill mortality (Constable et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Hill et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Murphy et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Wiedenmann, Cresswell, &amp; Mangel, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Furthermore, due to the direct dependency of krill on primary productivity, both as adults and as juveniles, climate‐driven changes in chlorophyll are expected to affect krill directly through loss of food resources (Atkinson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), given that their life cycles are synchronous with phytoplankton blooms (Clarke, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>), while reductions in sea ice will affect krill indirectly through loss of habitat and associated ice algae (Arrigo, Dijken, &amp; Pabi, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Meiners et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
