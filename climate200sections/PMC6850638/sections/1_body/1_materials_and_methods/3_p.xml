<p>The MICE includes four spatial zones, delimited by splitting the Southern Hemisphere into two oceanic Areas corresponding to the Atlantic/Indian Oceans (and corresponding Southern Ocean region) (130°E–60°W) and the Pacific Ocean and Southern Ocean region (60°W–130°E). These zones followed standards used in previous Southern Ocean ecosystem models (Branch, Matsuoka, &amp; Miyashita,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), which follow whale stock management boundaries established by the IWC. Each region was then split into two seasons—winter tropics (0–40°S) and summer polar (40–80°S, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The southern “polar” area extending to Antarctica corresponds to the austral summer (November–April) where whales are present in their polar feeding grounds and the northern winter “tropics” area to the equator covers the annual whale migration north to warmer waters (May–October). We further separated the summer polar region into four 10° Latitude bands (
