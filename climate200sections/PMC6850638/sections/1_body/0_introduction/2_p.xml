<p>Historical commercial whaling in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in the Southern Ocean, pushed most whale species to the brink of extinction (Figure

After the cessation by the 1980s of most harvesting in the Southern Hemisphere due to a moratorium on whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), depleted populations began to slowly recover. Although the protection measures avoided extinction of baleen whales, new pressures from human‐induced climate change are now affecting the marine environment and potentially the species within (Constable et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It is not yet known how future climate change may facilitate or hinder the recovery of whales, particularly those that forage heavily on krill in rapidly warming regions of the Southern Ocean (Simmonds &amp; Isaac,
