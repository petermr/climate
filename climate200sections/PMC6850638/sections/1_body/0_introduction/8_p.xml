<p>The ecosystem model links to an existing Nutrient–Phytoplankton–Zooplankton–Detritus model (NPZD) forced by a General Circulation Model that includes ocean and atmosphere dynamics (Law et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Ziehn, Lenton, Law, Matear, &amp; Chamberlain, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0117" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We extend earlier models (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) to include links from projected sea‐surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll to the whale prey base and whale species dynamics, to evaluate potential impacts of multiple climate drivers on key baleen whale species and their krill prey across the Southern Hemisphere. Our model further builds on previous research (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) by including two‐way interactions to explore how competition for limited prey may differentially affect whale populations in the future. We then consider how future changes in sea‐ice extent given warming might affect whale populations if species are able to shift their range to access more favourable environmental conditions.
