<p>Baleen whales in the Southern Hemisphere are particularly dependent on stable environmental conditions and sustenance from polar waters, travelling long distances from nursery grounds in lower‐latitude warmer waters to high‐latitude feeding grounds in the Antarctic where their primary prey species krill (
 <italic>Euphausia superba</italic>) and other zooplankton prey are found in high numbers. Their slow population growth rates, tight synchrony between life history and water temperatures, and dependency on lower trophic level prey, such as krill linked directly to primary productivity, may make baleen whales likely to be particularly sensitive to future climate change (Leaper et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms of change are still unclear as little is known of the dynamics among interacting species in Antarctic ecosystems. Recent research shows that global climate indices influence southern right whale breeding success by determining variation in food (krill) availability (Seyboth et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Changes in predator populations in response to climate‐induced changes in their environment and/or prey have been observed for other species in the Southern Hemisphere. Local declines in ice‐dependent Adelie (
 <italic>Pygoscelis adeliae)</italic>penguins versus increases in ice‐intolerant gentoo (
 <italic>Pygoscelis papua</italic>) and chinstrap (
 <italic>Pygoscelis antarctica</italic>) penguins in the West Antarctic Peninsula have been attributed by some to a climate shift, with increasing maritime influences from the north affecting ice availability and snow accumulation (Ducklow et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Fraser &amp; Trivelpiece,
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Alternative hypotheses, however, purport availability of and competition for krill, the dominant prey for nearly all vertebrates in the Antarctic, is more likely driving historical and present changes in predator numbers throughout the region (Trivelpiece et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Euphausiids are known to be the major food source of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean (Laws, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>), but we have little in situ knowledge of interspecific and intraspecific competitions among those whales for food (Kawamura, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). What is clear from the examples given for these other krill‐dependent species is that spatial and/or temporal mismatches between species life history or phenology and food or habitat availability play a large role in structuring polar ecosystems and species populations. This match–mismatch paradigm (Anderson, Gurarie, Bracis, Burke, &amp; Laidre, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Cushing, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1974</xref>) may be key to understanding and predicting effects of climate change on the survival, growth and reproduction of higher tropic levels of the marine food web.
