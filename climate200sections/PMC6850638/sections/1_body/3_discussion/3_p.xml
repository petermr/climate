<p>Climate change may shape the survival of marine species both through temporal or spatial mismatches in trophic interactions and the seasonal timing of prey availability (Anderson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Cushing, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1974</xref>), as well as from changing environmental conditions, such as the impact of warming on species distribution and migration patterns (Lloyd, Plagányi, Weeks, Magno‐Canto, &amp; Plagányi, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Sharp, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Our findings highlight the possible effects of spatial mismatches in krill and copepod prey availability. Whale species predominantly feeding in mid‐latitudes (40–60°S), such as humpback, fin and southern right whales, were more heavily impacted than those distributed further south because of predicted declines in krill and copepod prey in mid‐latitudes. This highlight that areas around the Antarctic circumpolar current are highly vulnerable to climate‐driven changes (Hill, Murphy, Reid, Trathan, &amp; Constable, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), and supports recent evidence of the direct cause–effect of the climate–krill–whale relationship for southern right whales (Seyboth et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>).
