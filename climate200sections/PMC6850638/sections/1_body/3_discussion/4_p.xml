<p>Our model results suggest that increased competition for krill prey by initially recovering whale populations over the next 100 years combined with predicted increases in minke whale numbers may be driving some of the projected further declines in both krill prey and whale predators. Minke whales responded earlier to increasing levels of krill abundance because the whale–krill functional relationship is most sensitive for minkes based on historical dynamics (see Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) and their populations grow faster than the bigger whale species (Taylor, Chivers, Larese, &amp; Perrin,

Thus, minke whales track krill biomass declines in the latter part of the 21st century, particularly in the Pacific mid‐latitudes where minke populations are abundant. Environmental change is likely to have a large effect on Antarctic predator–prey interactions and thus on energy transfer in marine systems (also see Trivelpiece et al.,
