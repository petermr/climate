<p>Second, outputs from the sea‐ice–linked model are only a first approximation to the types of direct impacts that habitat change and warming might have on whales. Other possible adaptive mechanisms warrant future investigation, including whether predicted warming in lower latitudes where migratory whales breed might increase the chance of juvenile survival due to range contractions, and decreased energy expenditure during migrations between feeding and breeding grounds (Cooke, Rowntree, &amp; Payne, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Leaper et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0114" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). We also did not explicitly model krill–ice dynamics because of insufficient data to quantify the relationships, but did consider their observed temperature preferences. Expected decreases in sea ice in some regions of the Antarctic may reduce krill survival more than we have incorporated here due to their reliance on ice algae as a food source in high latitudes (Flores et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, other macrozooplankton species could move south from more temperate waters and replace Antarctic krill, and this could be explored in future research using alternative scenarios of krill distribution shift. Furthermore, research shows salps dominate Antarctic marine ecosystems during poor krill years (Atkinson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), and the effect of the dominance of salps with sea‐ice reduction due to warming could be explored in future models. This model helps reduce some unknowns in krill–climate dynamics, despite a paucity of data, but future work would benefit from using more accurate survey information and improved experimental understanding of the responses of krill to multiple climate impacts. On the other hand, our projections may be too conservative if as Steffen et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) note, self‐reinforcing feedbacks push the planet on a much more severe “hothouse trajectory”, with melting of the East Antarctic ice sheet identified as one potential tipping element.
