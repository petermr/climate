<p>Changing environmental conditions and associated spatial and temporal variability in krill biomass differentially affected whale numbers depending on their feeding distribution across latitudes and oceanic regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Predicted declines in krill and copepod biomass in latitudes 50–60°S resulted in declining numbers of southern right, humpback and fin whales that feed predominantly in the mid‐latitudes. In contrast, increases in krill biomass around Antarctica in the highest latitudes (70–80°S, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f) resulted in concomitant increases in numbers of ice‐associated blue and minke whales in the Atlantic/Indian region (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a,e).
