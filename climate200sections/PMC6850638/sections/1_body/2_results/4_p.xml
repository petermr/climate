<p>Reduced krill biomass due to climate change combined with increased competition for krill prey by initially recovering whale populations are largely driving the modelled future declines in whale predators and krill prey (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For southern right whales, however, declines were associated with changes in productivity and declines in chlorophyll (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and subsequently their primary food of copepods in sub‐Antarctic mid‐latitude foraging grounds. Despite model trajectories showing historical increases in krill biomass to present day (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), declining overall trends are projected from now until the end of the century. The magnitude of the projected krill biomass decline was greater in the Pacific region (19% decline overall) than in the Atlantic (16% decline overall) by 2100. Spatial disaggregation of climate drivers and krill biomass into 10° latitude bands allowed evaluation of finer‐scale trends, with model results showing disparate spatial trends between latitudes exhibited by climate drivers and krill biomass over the next century (Figures 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Although warming was predicted across all latitude bands, the greatest future warming by the end of the 21st century was predicted between 40 and 60°S. Changes in SST predicted in the climate–NPZD model were highest in the Atlantic/Indian region, with an average 2.5°C warming in 40–50° and 2.2°C warming in 50–60° (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), although in some areas of these oceans SSTs may increase by almost 5°C by 2100. The most rapid loss of krill biomass was predicted in the mid‐latitudes (50–60°S), where declines to &lt;15% of the estimated starting biomass were predicted by 2100 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f), due largely to projected warming in this latitude from ~2.5°C currently to &gt;4°C by 2060 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), considered the threshold for krill survival. Greater declines in krill of &gt;85% of historical biomass in this latitude were predicted for the Atlantic/Indian region, compared to a 76% decline in the Pacific, however, greater increases were also predicted in the Atlantic/Indian highest latitudes around the Antarctic where krill biomass almost doubled by 2100. There were contrasting modest trends in Chl‐a in the different oceans and latitudinal bands, with some remaining unchanged and others showing increases or decreases (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In particular, decreases in Chl‐a were observed between 50 and 70° by 2100 in the Atlantic/Indian, although in the Pacific, only the region between 50 and 60° showed decreases in Chl‐a, with continuing increases in Chl‐a across the latitudes 60 and 70° in the Pacific region over the next century.
