<p>We ran an additional model investigating the adaptive capacity of whales to future sea‐ice change, based on whale energy expenditure and distribution. Concomitant with projected warming in Antarctic waters from the climate–NPZD model were projected changes in sea‐ice extent, with the greatest melting in our model predicted in the Atlantic/Indian sector (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Whale model fits to the historical data were identical to the climate‐forced scenario as extent was fixed prior to 2012. Abundance of most whale populations benefitted from adapting their range to changing sea ice (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Pacific whale populations benefitted the most from expansion of Antarctic ice‐free habitat when they were allowed to adapt to changing sea ice, with considerably slower declines predicted for southern right and fin whales than in the base model, and faster recovery in the case of humpback, blue and minke whales (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Minke whales benefited the most from changing sea ice across both regions and southward shifts towards the poles, with rapid increases in numbers over the next century tracking increasing krill biomass trends in the highest latitudes (70–80°S). These modelled increases in krill biomass in the highest polar latitudes were likely a result of increases in Chl‐a, which may be moderating the concomitant warming of up to 1.8°C in this region (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In contrast, southern right whales in the Atlantic/Indian did not benefit shifting distribution given changing sea ice due to their predominant distribution in mid‐latitudes where prey declines are predicted.
