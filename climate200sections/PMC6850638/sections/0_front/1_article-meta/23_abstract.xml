 <p>We predict impacts of historical commercial whaling (black bars, top), and future climate change, including changing sea‐surface temperature (shown in red, top), primary productivity and sea‐ice extent, on populations of baleen whales and their prey (krill and copepods) across the Southern Hemisphere. Despite initial recovery from commercial harvesting, models predict concerning declines for whale populations due to climate change by 2,100 for populations of blue (blue bars, bottom), fin (green, bottom), humpback (purple, bottom) and Southern right whales (orange, bottom) as a consequence of reduced krill prey (grey line) from warming.
