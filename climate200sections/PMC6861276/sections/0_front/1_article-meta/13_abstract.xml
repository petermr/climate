 <p id="Par1">Severe ozone (O
  <sub>3</sub>) episodes occur frequently in Shanghai during late-summers. We define geopotential height averaged over the key area region (122.5째E-135째E, 27.5째N -35째N) at 500 hPa as a WPSH_SHO
  <sub>3</sub> index which has high positive correlation with surface O
  <sub>3</sub> concentration in Shanghai. In addition, the index has a significant long-term increasing trend during the recent 60 years. Analysis shows the meteorological conditions under the strong WPSH_SHO
  <sub>3</sub> climate background (compared to the weak background) have several important anomalies: (1) A strong WPSH center occurs over the key area region. (2) The cloud cover is less, resulting in high solar radiation and low humidity, enhancing the photochemical reactions of O
  <sub>3</sub>. (3) The near-surface southwesterly winds are more frequent, enhancing the transport of upwind pollutants and O
  <sub>3</sub> precursors from polluted regions to Shanghai and producing higher O
  <sub>3</sub> chemical productions. This study suggests that the global climate change could lead to a stronger WPSH in the key region, enhancing ozone pollution in Shanghai. A global chemical/transport model (MOZART-4) is applied to show that the O
  <sub>3</sub> concentrations can be 30 ppbv higher under a strong WPSH_SHO
  <sub>3</sub> condition than a weak condition, indicating the important effect of the global climate change on local air pollution in Shanghai.
