<p id="Par28">A global chemistry transport model (MOZART-4; Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version-4) is used in this study. The detailed model description is shown by Emmons

 </sup>. The MOZART-4 model is a global chemical transport model. The model is designed to study the global distributions of tropospheric trace gases and aerosol particles. In this study, the horizontal resolution of the model is 0.7° × 0.7°, with 42 vertical levels. Advection of tracers is performed using the flux-formed semi-Lagrangian advection scheme

 <sup>

 </sup> is included in the model. The model transport is driven by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) assimilated wind fields, with 0.5° × 0.5° horizontal resolution

 <italic>et al</italic>.
