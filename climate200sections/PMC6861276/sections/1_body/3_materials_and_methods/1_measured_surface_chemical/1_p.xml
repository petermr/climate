<p id="Par26">Two measured surface O
 <sub>3</sub> datasets are used in the study: (1) Hourly averaged O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations from 2013 to 2017 are measured by the Urban Air Quality Center in China, operated by the Chinese Environmental Production Ministration (CEPM), at 367 monitoring stations (

 <sub>3</sub> concentrations, maximum average 8-hour ozone values (MDA8) and maximum average 1-hour ozone values (MDA1) are calculated in the Shanghai area. The monthly mean MDA8 O
 <sub>3</sub> and MDA1 O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations from late-summer in 2013 to 2017 are further calculated. (2) The hourly photolysis rate of NO
 <sub>2</sub> (J[NO
 <sub>2</sub>]) is measured and analyzed at the Pudong monitoring site of Shanghai Meteorological Service.
