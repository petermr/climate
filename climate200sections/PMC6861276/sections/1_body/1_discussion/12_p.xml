<p id="Par17">In order to better investigate the effects of the WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> on the O
 <sub>3</sub> pollution in Shanghai, a global chemical transport model (MOZART-4) is applied to calculate the distribution of ozone concentrations under the different WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> conditions (the strong case in Jul. 2017 and the weak case in Aug. 2016). The detailed model description is shown in section 2.3. First we conduct a model validation by comparing the model result with the measurement.
