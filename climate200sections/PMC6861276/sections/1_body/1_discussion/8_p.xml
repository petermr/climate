 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the large-scale atmospheric circulations over 500 hPa between the two cases. It shows the mid-level (500 hPa) circulations of weak case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) and strong case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) and its anomalies (the monthly mean values in 2017 minus the monthly mean values in 2016, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Compared to climatological WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> (solid lines), the WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> had characteristics with bigger area and stronger intensity under strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> climate background (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Moreover, there was significant sub-center of WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> over the key area regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast, the weak WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> had no high center over the West Pacific Ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). As a result, there were significant positive anomalies of geopotential height over 500 hPa in the West Pacific Ocean region, which was approaching the key area region mentioned in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. For example, the geopotential height over 500 hPa in the key area region of strong case is about 30–50 gpm higher than weak case.
