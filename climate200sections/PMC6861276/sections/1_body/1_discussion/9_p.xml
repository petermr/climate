 <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) find that radiation and wind (speed and direction) are the most important meteorological factors for affecting surface ozone pollution in Shanghai, which directly affect the photochemical reaction, diffusion and transport of surface ozone. In this study, the anomalies of the large-scale circulations over 925 hPa, relative humidity, solar radiation, and surface daily-max temperature between the weak and strong cases are investigated.
