<p id="Par20">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the calculated anomalies of the contributions of individual processes to O
 <sub>3</sub> formation in the Shanghai region under the different WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> conditions. In the strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case, the vertical diffusion produced significant reduction for the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations at the surface. This was due to the fact that with less cloud condition, the solar radiation was stronger, producing higher thermal turbulence and vertical diffusion. As a result, the surface O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations were vertical mixed in the upper planetary boundary layer, causing the decrease of O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations at surface layer in Shanghai (with a maximum reduction of 80–160 μg·m
 <sup>−3</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>). As we mentioned before, the wind direction in the strong case was favorable for the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations, which resulted in about 20–40 μg·m
 <sup>−3</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup> increase of surface O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>). The highest enhancement of O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations was due to the process of photochemistry. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>, the maximum increase of O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in Shanghai ranges about 100–180 μg·m
 <sup>−3</sup>·day
 <sup>−1</sup>, resulting from the higher O
 <sub>3</sub> chemical productivity. In total, the surface O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations were higher in the strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case than the weak WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case in Shanghai.
