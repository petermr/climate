<p id="Par10">To systematically study the impact of WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> on O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in Shanghai during late-summers, two different late-summer cases were selected and compared. The first case (Jul. 2017) was a typical strong WPSH case, with the maximum anomalies geopotential height, while the second case (Aug. 2016) was a typical weak WPSH, with the minimum anomalies geopotential height. It is interesting to note that the difference of geopotential height between the two cases is about 30 gpm, which is equivalent to the value between the values of WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> in 1957 and 2017 (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As a result, comparing the two extreme cases can provide useful insights to understand the impact of global climate change on WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> and the corresponding effects on O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in Shanghai.
