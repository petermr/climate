 </sup>. However, there is s lack of study to analyze the effect of global changes on WPSH and the consequence on the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in the Shanghai region. The focus of this study is to investigate a strong inter-annual variability of ozone pollution and the effect of global climate change on summertime ozone pollution in Shanghai. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the information of the methodology. In Section 3, some results and analysis are analyzed. Section 4 shows a brief conclusion of the results.
