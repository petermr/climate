We define geopotential height averaged over the key area region (122.5&#x000b0;E-135&#x000b0;E, 27.5&#x000b0;N -35&#x000b0;N) at 500 hPa as a WPSH_SHO<sub>3</sub> index which has high positive correlation with surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration in Shanghai. In addition, the index has a significant long-term increasing trend during the recent 60 years. Analysis shows the meteorological conditions under the strong WPSH_SHO<sub>3</sub> climate background (compared to the weak background) have several important anomalies: (1) A strong WPSH center occurs over the key area region. (2) The cloud cover is less, resulting in high solar radiation and low humidity, enhancing the photochemical reactions of O<sub>3</sub>. (3) The near-surface southwesterly winds are more frequent, enhancing the transport of upwind pollutants and O<sub>3</sub> precursors from polluted regions to Shanghai and producing higher O<sub>3</sub> chemical productions. This study suggests that the global climate change could lead to a stronger WPSH in the key region, enhancing ozone pollution in Shanghai. A global chemical/transport model (MOZART-4) is applied to show that the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations can be 30 ppbv higher under a strong WPSH_SHO<sub>3</sub> condition than a weak condition, indicating the important effect of the global climate change on local air pollution in Shanghai.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Atmospheric chemistry</kwd><kwd>Environmental impact</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004751</institution-id><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology | Department of S and T for Social Development (Department of S&#x00026;T for Social Development)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC0213800</award-id><award-id>2016YFC0203400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology | Department of S and T for Social Development (Department of S&#x00026;T for Social Development)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91644223</award-id><award-id>41475040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jianming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Science and Technology Research and Development project of Shanghai meteorological service (Grant No. MS201807) and the Shanghai Sailing Program (Grant No. 18YF1421200)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With rapid industrialization and urbanization in recent decades, China has been experienced persistent and serious air pollution problem, causing important impacts on human health and ecological environment (like crop damages)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Shanghai, as a rapidly developing megacity in China with a population of over 20 million, is suffering severe ozone pollutions during summer and haze episodes during winter in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The monitoring data in Shanghai demonstrates that the ozone concentrations had a significant long-term increasing trend during recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and the monthly mean O<sub>3</sub> concentrations increased about 67% from 2006 to 2016. In 2017, ozone pollution duration (148 days yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) exceeded PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution duration (60 days yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), becoming a primary pollutant for affecting air quality in Shanghai.</p><p id="Par3">In the troposphere, ozone is produced by a complicated chemical process, which initializes by the photochemical reactions of ozone precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>) and volatile organic carbons (VOC<sub>S</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. As the increase in industrial activity and number of automobiles, the precursors of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and the global budget of oxidization are also significantly increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Although photochemical process is important to determine ozone concentrations, previous studies suggest that local meteorological parameters such as temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, horizontal wind speed and direction, and cloud cover also play important roles in controlling ozone concentrations. For example, elevated ozone concentration is usually accompanied with strong solar radiation and small winds, which is favorable for the photochemical production of ozone and the accumulation of ozone and its precursor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Tie <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) suggest that radiation, wind speed and wind direction are the most important meteorological factors for causing the variability of surface ozone concentrations in Shanghai. These factors directly affect the photochemical reaction, regional transportation and diffusion process of ozone. Furthermore, synoptic-scale weather pattern, with spatial scale less than 1000&#x02009;km, is also an important factor in controlling ozone variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. For example, anticyclones (i.e., high pressure systems) produce favorable conditions for ozone production. At the center of anticyclones, it is normally sunny weather, with low wind velocity, causing high O<sub>3</sub> production and accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In coastal cities, sea-land breeze can be an important meteorological factor to affect ozone distributions. Tie <italic>et al</italic>. (2009) finds that the impact of sea breeze on O<sub>3</sub> concentration is noticeable in the city of Shanghai under calm weather condition.</p><p id="Par4">It is well known that the West Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is evident as a semi-permanent, sub-tropical anticyclone high pressure over the western North Pacific, affecting the summertime weather and climate in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Despite of the effect on weather conditions (such as summertime precipitation and temperature), WPSH has also important effects on vegetation coverage and other research field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Currently, the impact of the position and intensity of the WPSH on summertime ozone pollution over eastern China have been paid more attention. Most of the previous studies examine the relationship between the WPSH and ozone on a daily scale. For example, He <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> focus on an short-term ozone pollution event in Shanghai and finds that ozone mixing ratios in summertime at Chongming (a surface site in the northeast of Shanghai) are often higher during the days when the center of the WPSH locates to the southeast of that site, with a weak intensity. Some results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> show the subsidence air caused by the WPSH plays a crucial role in the formation of high-level O<sub>3</sub>. Zhao <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> studies the impact of WPSH on surface ozone daily variability over eastern China and demonstrates that a stronger WPSH is associated with lower ozone in South China but with higher ozone in North China, suggesting that this south-north difference can be explained by changing moisture transport associated with the WPSH variability.</p><p id="Par5">Generally, the WPSH is closely associated with the timing and spatial distribution of summer ozone concentrations in East Asia and may intensify in a warming climate background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, there is s lack of study to analyze the effect of global changes on WPSH and the consequence on the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the Shanghai region. The focus of this study is to investigate a strong inter-annual variability of ozone pollution and the effect of global climate change on summertime ozone pollution in Shanghai. The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the information of the methodology. In Section 3, some results and analysis are analyzed. Section 4 shows a brief conclusion of the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par6">Gao <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) and Lin <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) have demonstrated that the ozone concentrations in Shanghai steadily increase, with a strong seasonal variation. Because the effect of WPSH on O<sub>3</sub> concentrations often occurs in summer time, the monthly variation of ozone during 2013 to 2017 in the Shanghai region is analyzed and is presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the 8h-averaged ozone (MDA8 O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations have highest occurrences in late-summer (July and August) compared with those in other months. The new Chinese national ambient air quality standards (CNAAQS2012, GB 3095&#x02013;2012) has defined the severe, moderate, and slight ozone pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The total pollution days on July and August from 2013 to 2017 are 82 and 56 days, respectively. According to the study by Gao <italic>et al</italic>. (2017), the ozone concentrations are low in early summer (June), because of the occurrence of frequent precipitation in June which is named Meiyu-Baiu-Changma rain belt in China. Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> have demonstrate that the seasonal northward shifts of the WPSH are closely associated with the onset and withdrawal of the EASM, during July and August, the ridge of WPSH locate around Yangtze-Huaihe River region, and the weather conditions here are strongly controlled by the main body of WPSH system. As a result, it is important to understand the impact of WPSH on surface ozone in Shanghai during late-summer.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Monthly variation of ozone pollution days in Shanghai during 2013 to 2017 (orange, red and purple columns represent slight, moderate and severe pollutions respectively).

Five operational indices of WPSH based on the 5880 geopotential height (gpm) at 500 hPa, including the area, intensity, ridge lines, northern extension, and western boundaries are announced monthly by the National Climate Center (NCC) in China to describe the WPSH&#x02019;s evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. But the correlations between ozone concentrations in Shanghai and indices on a monthly scale is very poor, Consequently, it is necessary to develop a new objective index, which is not only with clear physical meanings to objectively describe the location and intensity of the WPSH, but also has significant associations with surface ozone in Shanghai. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the distribution of correlation coefficients between monthly mean MAD8 O<sub>3</sub> in Shanghai and the 500&#x02009;hPa geopotential height over Eastern Asia during late-summer from 2013 to 2017. To obtain correlation analysis data as more as possible, monthly mean data are used rather than late-summer mean data. Correlations between ozone concentrations and 500&#x02009;hPa geopotential height are positive in most parts of Eastern Asia. The significant positive correlation coefficients with 500&#x02009;hPa geopotential height (exceeding the 95% confidence level based on student-t test) are located over eastern ocean of China. The significant correlation coefficients related to the geopotential height averaged over the key area region (122.5&#x000b0;E-135&#x000b0;E, 27.5&#x000b0;N-35&#x000b0;N) at 500&#x02009;hPa shows a maximum positive correlation coefficient (0.78). Thus, we define geopotential height averaged over the key area region at 500&#x02009;hPa as the new definition index of WPSH&#x02019;s effect on ozone (called WPSH_SHO<sub>3</sub>). It not only represents the activity center and intensity of the WPSH over the key area region, but also it has high positive correlation with the surface ozone concentration in Shanghai.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The distribution of correlation coefficients between monthly mean MAD8 O<sub>3</sub> in Shanghai and the 500&#x02009;hPa geo-potential height over Eastern Asia during late-summer from 2013 to 2017 (Black box represents the key region of WPSH.

It is interesting to note that the difference of geopotential height between the two cases is about 30 gpm, which is equivalent to the value between the values of WPSH_SHO<sub>3</sub> in 1957 and 2017 (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

And the possible effects of relative humidity (RH) on the ozone formation can be well explained by Yu (2018), as the paper shows, more air humidity could inhibits O<sub>3</sub> formation by lowering air temperature and some complicated chemistry processes, like decreasing the chain length of peroxy radical chemical amplifiers (HO<sub>2</sub>, RO<sub>2</sub>, and RC(O)O<sub>2</sub>), and decreasing the chain length of NO<sub>2</sub> by enhancing particle water, and destroys the existing O<sub>3</sub> photo-chemically by water vapor through catalytic O<sub>3</sub> destruction cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.
