 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the Pearson correlations (

 <italic>q</italic> statistics between three temperature indicators and the MMT. The MFT has a stronger correlation with the MMT than the other two mainstream indicators. The correlation coefficient between MFT and MMT reaches 0.93 (
