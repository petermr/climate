<p id="Par15">Based on the MMT–MFT association, we can use MFT to estimate the MMT. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the global distribution of the estimated MMTs during the 2010s for each 0.5° × 0.5° grid. The MMT varies considerably across the planet. The MMT tends to decrease gradually from low latitudes to high latitudes.
