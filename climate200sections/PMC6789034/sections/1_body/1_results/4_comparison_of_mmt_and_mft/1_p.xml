<p id="Par14">The temperature characteristics and distributions of different climate regions have significant diversity. To test whether the relationship between MMT and MFT will change under different climatic conditions, we investigate the associations between the MFT, the 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature, the annual mean temperature, and the MMT in three main climate regions (tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones). The results are shown in (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we can see that in all climate regions, the MFT is the best indicator of MMT, particularly in tropical and temperate regions.
