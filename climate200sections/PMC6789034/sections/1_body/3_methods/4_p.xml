<p id="Par29">The 420 locations in the present study covered eight of the 11 major climatic zones, (including tropical grassland, tropical monsoon, tropical rainforest, subtropical monsoon, temperate continental, temperate maritime, temperate monsoon, and Mediterranean climates, excluding for the tropical desert, plateau mountain, and cold climates). We combined eight climatic zones into three categories: temperate climate (including 91 locations), subtropical climate (including 174 locations), and tropical climate (including 155 locations) regions. For these three main climate regions, we analysed the associations between the MFT, the 78th percentile temperature, the annual mean temperature, and the MMT (Fig.Â
