<p id="Par17">The existing MMT estimates are usually based on case studies in data-rich regions, and limited evidence about MMT is available at a global scale, particularly in underdeveloped and developing areas. It is still unclear how MMT will change under global climate change. Our findings fill these research gaps. We found that although the MMT changes geographically, it can be well represented by the local MFT. Compared with two other indicators (annual mean temperature and 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature), MFT is the best indicator for fitting MMT. Furthermore, the association between MFT and MMT is not changed and the model performance is not changed when GDP/capita, latitude and the study year are adjusted (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The analysis of data from 420 locations provides evidence for this finding in a wide range of climates and populations with different demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructural characteristics. Based on the MMT–MFT association, we have made the first estimate of the global distribution of MMTs in the present (2010s) and future (2050 s).
