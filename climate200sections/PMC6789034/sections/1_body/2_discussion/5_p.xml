<p id="Par21">Different climate regions have diverse climate characteristics and temperature distributions, which may lead to different regular patterns of MMT. For three main climate zones (tropical, subtropical, and temperate region), we compared the associations between the MFT, the 78th percentile temperature, the annual mean temperature, and the MMT. The results showed that in all climate regions, the MFT is the best indicator of MMT, particularly in tropical and temperate regions.</p>
