 <caption> Error histograms for three temperature indicators as MMT. a– c Respectively show the error distributions of MFT as MMT, the 78 th percentile temperature as MMT, and annual mean temperature as MMT. By comparing the errors of using three temperature indicators to represent MMT, MFT is proved to be a better indicator. a Using MFT as the surrogate for MMT, the locations with an error of less than 1 °C account for a proportion of 71%, which is much higher than using the 78 th percentile temperature (44%, b) and the annual mean temperature (13%, c) to represent MMT </caption>
