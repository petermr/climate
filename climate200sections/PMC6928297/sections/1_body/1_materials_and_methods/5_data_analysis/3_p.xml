<p id="p0085">In addition, descriptive statistics were calculated using frequencies and percentages, and inferential statistics such as independent sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were also calculated using demographic independent variables (such as age, years of farming experience, education) and dependent variable (perception). The study, also, checked for homogeneity of variance which exceeded 0.05, and according to 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Pallant (2016)</xref>, homogeneity of variance greater than 0.05 indicates that homogeneity of variance assumption has not been violated. The effect size for t-test and ANOVA was also computed, in addition to multiple regression analysis (probit). Perception variable was converted into binary variable to enable probit regression analysis. Prior to the computation of the regression, multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity assumptions were checked. A simple correlation matrix was computed to ascertain multicollinearity of the variables in the model (see 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Gujarati (1995)</xref> establishes a rule of thumb which says that, multicollinearity is a serious problem when the correlation coefficient between two variables is 0.8 or above. We also tested to find out whether heteroscedasticity was present in the model using a Breusch-Pagan test. The results show that the null hypothesis of constant variance should be rejected (
