<p id="p0070">Both primary and secondary data were collected. Secondary data for the study consisted meteorological (rainfall, wind speed and temperature) and census data collected from the Ghana Meteorological Agency in Accra and the Planning Department of the Adansi North District Assembly, respectively. The lack of climate data at the district level necessitated the use of regional (Ashanti region) climate data from 1988 to 2017 for temperature and rainfall, and 2001 to 2017 for wind speed. Using regional climate data as a proxy for the Adansi North District may not provide vividly the extent of changes in the district, as different communities exhibit difference in climate. Nevertheless, districts in the Ashanti region portray fairly similar characteristics, typical of the semi-deciduous forest agroecological zone of Ghana (

In addition, the Ashanti region has one synoptic station located in Kumasi, which was used for the study. Primary data was collected from smallholder farmers and district agriculture officers from April to September, 2018. Prior to data collection, the Institutional Review Board of the Pan African University approved the study. Five research assistants were recruited and trained on the modalities for questionnaire administration. The two-day training of the research assistants ensured uniformity in questionnaire administration and enhanced the credibility of the data collected (
