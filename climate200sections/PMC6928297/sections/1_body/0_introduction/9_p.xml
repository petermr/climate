 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sultan and Gaetani (2016)</xref>, phase 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CIMP3 and CIMP5) exhibit low skills in projecting variability in West African Monsson. To this end, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Biasutti (2013)</xref> indicates that projection of the Sahel's wet and dry conditions, has faced uncertainties, due to the shortcoming of existing models. Inaccuracy in projection in West Africa has been associated to the response of coupled models to both direct and indirect radioactive forcing of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Biasutti et al. (2009)</xref> note that while coupled models have enhanced a better understanding of monsoon precipitation and atmospheric circulation in West Africa, particularly in the 21st century, the same models reveal inconsistencies in future projection. In Ghana, 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Nkrumah et al. (2014)</xref> also noted that climate measuring instruments produce inaccurate data, which makes it difficult to understand local reality and the extent of changes. For instance, the study reported gaps in rain gauge data in Ghana and identified imbalances and underestimation of rainfall in Ghana by the Regional Climate Model (RegCM3). Intuitively, climate policies based solely on climate data may not achieve their intended objectives as they fail to understand and incorporate local reality and the extent of changes at the grassroots as well as the perceptions of smallholder farmers. Thus, it is imperative for studies to explore climate data in relation to local realities of climate change, as perceived by smallholder farmers. This paper, therefore, examines smallholder farmers' climate change experiences and perception in relation to longitudinal climate data and analyzes the correlation between perception and climate data as well as the factors influencing smallholder farmers' perception. The findings from the study contribute immensely to a better understanding of climate change in Ghana and advances climate change and adaptation policies. The subsequent sections of the paper present materials and methods, findings and discussion as well as conclusion.
