<p id="p0175">The smallholder farmers and district agriculture officers have experienced rising temperature, late onset and early cessation of rainfall as well as increasing rainfall intensity and a decrease in rainfall duration. The results of the trends analysis of rainfall and temperature also showed an increasing rainfall and rising temperature in the Ashanti region. However, the correlation results showed that there is no significant relationship between smallholder farmers’ climate change perceptions and meteorological data as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, even though perception has a weak positive correlation with rainfall (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.051, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.320) and a weak negative correlation with temperature (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.072, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.160). There is also a negative relationship between rainfall and temperature (
 <italic>r</italic> = -0.078, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.129), which indicates that as temperature increases, there is a reduction in rainfall and vice versa. The lived experiences of the smallholder farmers confirm the relationship between rainfall and temperature, as the farmers reported that they receive less rainfall in the dry season when the temperature is high while during the raining season there is less sunshine with corresponding low temperature. Nevertheless, according to the
