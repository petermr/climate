 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, seasonal and annual trends of wind speed are presented. The results show an increasing trend of wind speed for major rainfall season, with a magnitude of 10.9 knots and a decreasing trend for both minor rainfall (-0.22 kts) and dry (-0.36 kts) seasons (see 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>a). There is also an increase in annual wind speed, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>b. 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Padi (2017)</xref> reports that high windstorm accompany intense rainfall during the major raining season. Unlike the Savannah region where windstorm is high during the dry/harmattan season, the Ashanti region observes a fairly decrease in windstorm during both minor rainfall and dry seasons (
