 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, the trends of minimum temperature are presented. The results show an increase in minimum temperature for major and minor rainfall seasons as well as dry season and annual temperature. The magnitude of increase is higher in minor rainfall (0.02 °C) and dry (0.03 °C) seasons than major rainfall season (0.01 °C). Intuitively, temperature in Ghana is high during the dry season due to the absence of rainfall (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> also shows rising seasonal and annual maximum temperature. These findings are consistent with previous studies which revealed rising temperature in Ghana (

 <sub>3</sub> and C
 <sub>4</sub> crops such as rice and sugar cane. Nevertheless, high temperature leads to high evapotranspiration in crops, which reduces agricultural productivity (
