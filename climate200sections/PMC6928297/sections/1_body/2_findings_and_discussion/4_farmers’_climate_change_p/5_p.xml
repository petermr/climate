<p id="p0140">The qualitative data from household heads (smallholder farmers), Agriculture Extension Agents (AEAs) and District Development Officers (DDOs) provided insight into the changes observed in temperature, rainfall and windstorm in the district. Almost all interview participants agreed that there has been an increase in temperature in recent times. Both officers and household heads concluded that temperature in the district has increased compared to what they knew in the past 30 years. An Extension Agent recounted that “
 <italic>there is high temperature in the district in recent times as the sun shines very much these times compared to the past 20 to 30 years</italic>” (AEA2)
 <italic>.</italic> Another Extension Agent indicated that “
 <italic>at first, high temperature began from 13 h GMT to about 15 h GMT but nowadays even at 8hours GMT, 9hours GMT or 10 h GMT, the weather is very hot. The sun shines a lot, leading to high temperature. The sun also shines for a long time these days</italic>” (AEA1). A household head also revealed that “
 <italic>it is clear that the temperature has increased in intensity and duration. The temperature is very hot these days compared to the olden days. About 40 years ago when I used to live with my parents as a young boy, we used to stay at home and go to our farm anytime of the day because the temperature was favourable. These days you cannot stay at home and go to the farm anytime because of the high intensity of temperature</italic>” (HH25).
