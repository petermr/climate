<p>This study selected the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, and the relative error to calibrate and verify the model. The basic criteria are as follows: (1) The average annual runoff error in the simulation period is as close as possible to 0; (2) the correlation coefficient of simulated flow and the observed flow is as close as possible to 1; (3) the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is as large as possible.</p>
