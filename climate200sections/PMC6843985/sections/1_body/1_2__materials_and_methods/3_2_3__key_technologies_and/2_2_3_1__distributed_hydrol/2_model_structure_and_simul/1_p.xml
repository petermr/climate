<p>The model structure is mainly divided into a horizontal structure and a vertical structure. The vertical structure refers to the calculation of the flow generation process by simulation of the vertical structure in each basic calculation unit. The horizontal structure mainly includes channel confluence of slope runoff with tributaries or main streams. In terms of its simulation elements, the hydrological processes simulated in this study mainly include the canopy interception, and surface process, as well as the soil process, groundwater process, slope confluence and channel confluence processes. These elements all have physical mechanisms and can be expressed or calculated by the corresponding mathematical formulas.</p>
