<p>This study mainly analyzed the spatial and temporal extent effects of the slope ecological restoration on runoff in different periods. At the spatial scale, the runoff variations of seven key sections were compared to identify the spatial impacts of slope ecological restoration on the runoff. At the temporal scale, the first procedure is to analyze the annual average, wet season, temperate season, dry season and monthly average runoff from 1965 to 2017 to identify the temporal impacts of slope ecological restoration on the amount of runoff. The second procedure is to adopt a different time series (inter-annual and inter-monthly) coefficient of variation (CV) for the runoff to analyze the impacts of slope ecological restoration on the process of runoff change. CV is an indicator that effectively reflects the interannual variability of the runoff. The CV being larger indicates that the variation of the runoff is stronger [
