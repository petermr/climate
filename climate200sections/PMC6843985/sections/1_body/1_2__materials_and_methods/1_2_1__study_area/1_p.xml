<p>Huangshui is the first tributary of the upper reaches of the Yellow River in northern China, which flows through Qinghai and Gansu Provinces. The total length of the main stream is 374 km, and the area is 17733 km
 <sup>2</sup>. The study area is the Huangshui River basin above the center of Minhe County, with a total basin area of 15558 km

The Huangshui River Basin is located in the transition zone between the Loess Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, ranging from 36°02′N–37°28′N and 100°42′E–103°01′E. The basin lies in the northwest inland, far from the sea, which belongs to a plateau arid and plateau semi-arid continental climate. The annual average precipitation was 381.1 mm in the period from 1960 to 2017. The distribution is extremely uneven during the year, with the most precipitation from May to September, accounting for 84.3% of the annual precipitation. A total of 76.1% of the regional’s Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) reached 0.6, and the main vegetation types include coniferous forests, shrubs, grasslands and meadows, accounting for 3.6 %, 24.5%, 29.7%, and 27.9% of the whole basin, respectively. Since the 1970s, in order to effectively improve the local ecological environment and slow down soil and water loss, slope ecological restoration has been carried out through the afforestation of Pinus tabulaeformis and recovered vegetation via enclosures. By 2017, the forest land area reached 38.36%, of which 62.6% was caused by slope ecological restoration. In recent years, the regional climate has become warm and humid [
