<p>The representative concentration pathways (RCPS) are developed by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the fifth assessment report in May 2011, which provides a comprehensive set of high spatial resolution climate scenarios. In this study, three representative RCPs for future climate change conditions were used, that is, the high emission scenario RCP8.5, the medium emission scenario RCP4.5 and the low emission scenario RCP2.6 [
