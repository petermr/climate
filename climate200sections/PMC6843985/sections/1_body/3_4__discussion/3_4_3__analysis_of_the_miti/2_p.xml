<p>According to the results in different seasons, the runoff increased in the wet and dry season, and decreased in the temperate season. Overall, the wet season led to an increase in the annual runoff, and under the climate scenarios, the precipitation mainly increased in the wet season. More precipitation may be converted to lateral flow rather than into evaporation [
