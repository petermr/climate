<p>Based on the significant results of slope ecological restoration in different periods and the effects of slope ecological restoration on the runoff process, it is important to further explore the impacts of slope ecological restoration on the runoff under future climate scenarios. Relevant studies have shown that climate change and slope ecological restoration might have the effects of counteracting or canceling, which may lead to a relative stable trend of annual runoff [

This study has found that, under the same RCP in the future, with an increase in the slope ecological restoration scale, the annual runoff of the basin will increase by about 20%, while under the current climate conditions, the slope ecological restoration reduced the annual runoff amount by about 6.1%. Overall, the effect of slope ecological restoration is eliminated, and the runoff process is mainly affected by climate change. In addition, the study area is located in alpine and semi-arid regions, and relevant studies showed that topography also plays an important role in regulating hydrology processes. The plateau is not active in the rainfall-runoff process and is dominated by vertical hydrological processes (i.e., evaporation and percolation) [
