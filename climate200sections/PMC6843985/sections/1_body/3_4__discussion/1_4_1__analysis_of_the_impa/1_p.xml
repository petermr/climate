<p>Because the impact of forest land changes the hydrological runoff process significantly, this study analyzed, in detail, the impact of slope ecological restoration on river runoff process in different periods. The results revealed that the slope ecological restoration in different periods was of a different scale, but, on the whole, with 2000 as the dividing point, the extent of slope ecological restoration in 1980–2000 was relatively small, and the extent of slope ecological restoration in 2000–17 was relatively large. Each slope ecological restoration scenario reduced the annual average runoff, the runoff in the wet season and temperate season. Further, the reduced runoff of S0017 and S8017 was greater than that of S8000. This is because the vegetation albedo is relatively darker, according to an increase of forest land. The extra energy could be dissipated as enhanced vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation. In addition, the slope ecological restoration can intercept precipitation, improve surface roughness, improve the soil structure, and increase infiltration, which leads to a decrease in runoff [

The results in this study are also consistent with the results of previous research in the Yellow River Basin: Sun et al. showed that plantation may reduce water yield up to 50% in the temperate zones of northern China such as the Loess Plateau [

According to the results of different seasons, for the wet season of lush vegetation, the larger the scale of slope ecological restoration, the greater the interception. For the dry season, compared with S80, the runoff of S8000, S0017, and S8017 increased. Analyzing the monthly results, the runoff of January, February, March, and December in the dry season always increased. Some studies have shown that the slope ecological restoration in the northwest of China increased the base flow [

 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, from the perspective of runoff, the slope ecological restoration had the effect of “eliminating peak and replenishing dry” and reduced the variability of the runoff process, which will also help reduce flood risk and drought risk, increase the amount of water available in the dry season, and contribute to the healthy development of human beings.
