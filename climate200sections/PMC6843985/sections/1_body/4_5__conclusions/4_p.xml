<p>Under the conditions of climate change, the effect of slope ecological restoration on runoff is more complicated. Under the same RCP, the slope ecological restoration mainly affected the runoff process in the temperate season, while the runoff process in the wet season and dry season are significantly affected by future climate change. Due to the counteracting or canceling effects of climate change and slope ecological restoration, the variation of the CV in different sections presented spatial inconsistency, and the CV of some sections decreased, indicating that slope ecological restoration has a certain slowing effect on future climate change.</p>
