<p>Through quantitative identification of the scale of slope ecological restoration in different periods and simulation of the impact of slope ecological restoration on the runoff in different periods, this study preliminarily identified the response process of runoff to future climate change. These results are expected to provide insights into the feasibility of planning for future slope ecological restoration and could be useful to study the extreme effects caused by climate change in the future, with important implications for the ecological environment and the healthy development of human beings in China and globally. However, the specific impact mechanisms behind the runoff generation process and the confluence process remain unclear. Further research should be carried out in-depth, and a control experiment could be used to analyze how to affect the runoff production process and the confluence process under certain changes of precipitation, temperature and afforestation scales. In this way, the response mechanisms of slope ecological restoration to future climate change can be better explored.</p>
