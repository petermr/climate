The vast majority of studies about the effects of slope ecological restoration and climate change on the water resources of the Yellow River have focused on the trends analyses of annual streamflow and the attribution of the changes in streamflow to climate change and slope ecological restoration [

However, this research usually does not follow the forest variation law of slope ecological restoration, and the exploration of climate change and slope ecological restoration’s relationship to runoff and the quantification of their impact on runoff have rarely been conducted [
