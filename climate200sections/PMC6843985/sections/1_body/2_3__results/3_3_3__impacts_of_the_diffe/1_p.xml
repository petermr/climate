<p>To facilitate expression, the abbreviation (S) is combined with numbers for the different periods (80, 8000, 8017) to represent the slope ecological restoration scenarios, and combined with the representative numbers of the RCPs (26, 45, 85), the slope ecological restoration scenario is represented in a certain period and a certain climate scenario (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-04017-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The results of the runoff comparison from 1960 to 2017 were as follows: According to the average annual, wet season, and temperate season runoff of the whole basin, compared with the runoff simulated under S80, the runoff simulated under S8000, S0017 and S0017 decreased. The runoff of S0017 was the lowest of the three, with an average annual runoff decrease of 110 million m
 <sup>3</sup>, which was 6.1% lower than that of the S80. The smallest change in the runoff was the S8000, which was close to the runoff of the S80, with a reduction of only 1 million m
 <sup>3</sup>. The runoff in the dry season showed that, compared with the runoff simulated under S80, the runoff simulated under S8000, S0017, and S8017 increased by 0.6%, 10.78% and 11.98%, respectively. The increase of the forest land extent was conducive to an increase in runoff during the dry season (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04017-f011">Figure 11</xref>b), compared with S80, the runoff of other schemes increased significantly or slightly in January, February, March, November and December, correspondingly, and the runoff of other schemes decreased from April to October. The results indicated that the slope ecological restoration had the effects of “eliminating peak and replenishing dry” during the process of runoff.
