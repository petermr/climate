<p>Xinachuan Station (located in the tributary of Xinachuan River), Qiaotou Station (located in the upper reaches of the tributary of Beichuan River), Xining Station (located in the middle reaches of the main stream) and Minhe Station (located in the lower reaches of the main stream) were selected to verify the monthly natural runoff process in the basin. The M-K method was used to analyze the abrupt change with a 10-year moving average precipitation in the basin, and 1985 was selected as the abrupt point, which is the demarcation point between the calibration period and the validation period. The results showed that the NSE coefficients were greater than 0.65, the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.85, and the relative errors were about 15% in the calibration period. The NSE coefficients were greater than 0.6, the correlation coefficients were about 0.8 and the relative errors were about 15% in the validation period (
