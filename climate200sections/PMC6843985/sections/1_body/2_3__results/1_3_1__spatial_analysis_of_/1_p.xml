<p>The change trends of slope ecological restoration in different periods were as follows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04017-f009">Figure 9</xref>): Compared with 1980, by the year 2000, the forest land had increased relatively by 0.2%, and by 2017, the forest land had increased relatively by 131.5%; the area of the slope ecological restoration was 3735 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Thus indicated that the change in the scale of slope ecological restoration mainly happened after 2000. From an ecological point of view, the slope ecological restoration had many environmental effects, including greater carbon sequestration [
