<p id="Par4">Identifying the relative magnitudes of these uncertainties, their shapes, and interactions is very relevant to policy makers, who need to make decisions with decadal consequences today. To characterize the interactions among these multiple sources of uncertainty, we leverage on the new socioeconomic (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, SSPs) and climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs)

 </sup>, and combine empirically derived reduced-form responses of sectoral energy demand by fuel with climatological exposures and socioeconomic variables. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways are a set of socioeconomic and GHG emission scenarios that have been developed by the research community at the request of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and that are used to make scenario-based mitigation and impacts studies more comparable across the literature.
