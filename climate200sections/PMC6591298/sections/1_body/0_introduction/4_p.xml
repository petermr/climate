<p id="Par6">Our contribution is to develop climate-induced shocks that can be subsequently included in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) or Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models to derive actual ex post energy consumption, which could be substantially moderated by substitution and price adjustments across multiple markets

 </sup>. These intervening adjustments ultimately drive the economic impacts, such as changes in household incomes and welfare. Their scale and scope depend on future changes in structural, technological, and market characteristics that top–down, empirically based approaches imperfectly reflect, and that can be better analyzed using IAM or CGE frameworks
