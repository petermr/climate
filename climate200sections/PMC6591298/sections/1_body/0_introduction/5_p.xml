<p id="Par7">We employ econometric estimates of the per-capita demand for three different final energy carriers associated with heating and cooling (electricity, petroleum products, and natural gas, see specific definition in Supplementary Note 1.) in four economic sectors (agriculture, industry, residential, and commercial) for tropical and temperate countries as a function of per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and exposure to hot (&gt;27.5 °C) and cold (&lt;12.5 °C) days obtained from De Cian and Sue Wing (2018)

 </sup>—hereafter DCSW. We use cold and hot days as an alternative indicator to heating and cooling degree days, commonly computed using 18 °C as the comfort threshold, a value suitable to temperate regions, but not to tropical countries. The cutoff values for defining hot and cold days in our study are based on the distribution of daily average temperature across all world regions in temperate and tropical countries and meet the need to capture low and high extremes while guaranteeing a sufficient number of observations. See Fig. 2 in DCSW

 </sup>. We combine the income elasticities for energy consumption with GDP per-capita projections from the SSPs. We determine the climatic shocks by combining temperature elasticities with the change in the number of hot and cold days between now and 2050 from 21 Earth System Models (ESMs) and two emission scenarios: RCPs 4.5 and 8.5
