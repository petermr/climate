<p id="Par23">Our impact projections, although comprehensive, are limited by the quantity and quality of the data available to undertake a global analysis. Similar to other existing empirical studies, we could not identify significant temperature elasticities for several combinations of energy carriers, sectors, and climatic zones (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), most importantly residential electricity use in tropical areas in response to changes in hot days. We do find that developing countries’ per-capita income growth drives substantial extensive-margin investments in energy-using durable goods, particularly residential air conditioning

 </sup>. However, by treating the effect of future air-conditioning penetration as orthogonal to temperature responses, our methodology ignores the possibility that this higher level of air-conditioning adoption can further amplify the growth in electricity demand with climate change
