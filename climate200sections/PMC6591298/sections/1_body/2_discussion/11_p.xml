The present impact estimates are key inputs to the Integrated Assessment Model or CGE model simulations, which can examine the shifts in economic structure or technology between socioeconomic and climate scenarios driven by our ex ante shocks. Rebound effects and price changes will also dampen the consequent changes energy demand, further influencing the gap between our projections and ex post outcomes

 </sup>. Given these considerations, our findings should be interpreted not as future physical changes in energy use, but as the changes in demand that, without price, substitution, and induced technical change adjustments, would maintain the level of economic services delivered by energy systems in the baseline scenario, if they were subjected to temperature shocks. Within CGE models, a practical way to operationalize such impacts could be technological shift parameters that lower the productivity of energy inputs to sectoral economic activities by the warranted percentage increase in energy demand, and vice versa. Induced technological change could then be modeled as a structural process that generates ex post modifications of such productivity shifts, following the practices of bottom-up approaches.
