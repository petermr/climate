<p id="Par28">Urbanization is implicit in our methodology, as future temperature fields are population-weighted, and the spatial distribution of population varies across SSPs along with country-level population trends, which do play a large role in the underlying SSP projections. Across the SSPs, urbanization levels vary widely

 </sup>, with low urbanization in SSP3 and high urbanization in SSP1 and SSP5. Urbanization drives the location of population in the SSP spatial population projections, where they are allocated from the national level to individual grid cells. In our projections, urbanization determines to which temperature changes people are exposed, and temperature changes in urban grid cells are more dominant in higher-urbanization scenarios.
