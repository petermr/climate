<p id="Par21">Starting with the sectoral dimension, the few existing global-scale studies focus on the residential sector and confirm our finding that warming will reduce overall global energy use for residential space conditioning by 2050

More recent global studies projecting future energy demand pathways for the (broader defined) building sector point at residential space cooling as a key driver for the projected net increase in final energy demand across different SSPs

By considering a broader range of energy-using sectors, we highlight the potentially important impacts of commercial and industrial adaptation to climate change, which has only been explored for specific regions
