<p id="Par20">Across the four economic sectors and three energy carriers, climate change increases the world’s total final energy demand at mid-century by 11–27% (25–58%) under moderate (vigorous) warming on top of socioeconomic developments. As our study is the first with global comprehensive coverage across four major sectors, comparison with the literature can only be done on the sectoral or regional level. Moreover, the wide distribution across ESMs in our results implies that any comparison of future climate-change impacts based on a subset of climate models represents just a single data point in a distribution.</p>
