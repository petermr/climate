<p id="Par13">CMIP5 projections of temperature around 2050 show pronounced increases in hot days throughout the tropics, especially in the southern hemisphere. The median annual increase in the tropics is around 100 hot days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). The mid-latitudes experience increases in the number of hot days that are much smaller, but still double their exposure compared with the present climate. Declines in exposure to &lt;12.5 °C days are concentrated in the mid-latitudes, especially in the northern hemisphere, but these changes are much smaller in both relative and absolute magnitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e and Supplementary Fig.6). Owing to the northerly skewed distribution of population, current, and future baseline energy demand, climatic changes exert impacts that are potentially large and of opposite sign compared to socioeconomic forces.
