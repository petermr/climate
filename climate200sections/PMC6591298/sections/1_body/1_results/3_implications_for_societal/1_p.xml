<p id="Par18">We combine the spatial population projections for the SSPs with the changes described above to characterize the distribution of vulnerable populations to the impacts of climate change on energy demand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Impacts exhibit substantial variation across energy carriers and sectors (Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1,</xref>
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Regarding the total final energy demand, a minority of the world’s population experiences modest (0–10%) declines (mostly in Russia, Western Europe, Canada, and Chile/Argentina) and the majority faces modest (0–25%) increases, with about 30% of people experiencing substantial increases (of &gt;25%) over a very wide range. The longest tails of the distribution are for electricity demand and for the commercial and industrial sectors. This pattern shifts only slightly across SSPs, with the biggest changes being the absolute level of the population. Higher radiative forcing lengthens the impact distribution’s upper tail and increases its inter-model dispersion.
