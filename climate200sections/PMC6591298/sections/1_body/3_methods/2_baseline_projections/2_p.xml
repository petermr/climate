 </sup>. The SSPs have diverging narratives that describe how these worlds evolve into high or low challenges to mitigation or adaptation

 </sup>. SSP1 represents a world with low socioeconomic challenges to both adaptation and mitigation. In SSP2, intermediate progresses have been made, and both adaptation and mitigation challenges remain at a medium level, whereas SSP3 represents a future with high challenges on both dimensions. In SSP4 and SSP5, adaptation or mitigation challenges dominate respectively. Several key variables have been projected forward for each of the SSPs. In this paper, we use SSP projections of future spatial population change

 </sup> and GDP growth for 183 countries

 </sup>. A global summary of population and GDP of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways is shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> to indicate the wide variation between SSPs. There is some debate on whether each of the five SSPs can actually be combined with all levels of climate change from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (for details, see Figure 8 in Riahi et al.
 <sup>

 </sup>). This is especially relevant for the highest-emission scenario, RCP8.5, which can only be reached under SSP5. However, the widest diversion between scenarios, both for the SSPs and the RCPs, takes place in the second half of the 21st century. In this paper, we only focus on results for mid-century, a period for which the potential inconsistency between SSPs and RCPs is much less clear. Moreover, we only use GDP and population from the SSPs and whether the projections for economy and population of 2050 are inconsistent with RCP8.5 levels of warming, is still an open question. Finally, in the structure of our impact analysis, the main difference between the SSPs are different distributions of population over the planet (i.e., different countries have higher/lower population growth) and different sectoral composition of energy demand, due to differences in economic growth. These are both relevant uncertainties to explore in the context of this impact study, and both these issues are not the main uncertainties with respect to (in-)consistency between the SSPs and RCP8.5.
