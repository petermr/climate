<p id="Par35">In this paper, we use the historical evidence on energy use over a period of about 30 years summarized in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> as an analog of how we might use energy in the future over the next 30 years to generate a set of counterfactual scenarios aimed at exploring climate and socioeconomic uncertainty. Because the elasticities for cold and hot days are estimated individually, future impacts in response to changes in both hot and cold days can be reported individually or combined.
