 </sup> and compares them with elasticities obtained from the static and first-difference specifications. The semi-elasticities to temperature bins reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> suggest that temperature change has an influence on energy demand in 16 out of 24 energy carrier, sector, region combinations. Temperature semi-elasticities indicate that energy carrier demands tend to increase with hot days with a magnitude that varies among energy carriers and sectors. Responses to hot and cold days are asymmetric, and depending on whether an energy carrier is mostly used for heating or cooling, response in one or both directions can be significant. Several semi-elasticities to cold days are negative, suggesting that extreme cold weather could reduce energy demand, especially in production processes in industry and agriculture. The negative estimates can be due to reduced energy consumption for cooling or irrigation during the shoulder seasons of spring and fall (e.g., reduction in electricity use in commercial activities, industry, and agriculture), or to fuel switching (e.g., from petroleum products to electricity in the commercial sector in the tropics). An increase in cold days can temporarily induce production activities to reduce their electricity demand and/or temporarily shift to cheaper sources such as natural gas. Moreover, commercial and industrial consumers may also have back-up energy generation.
