<p id="Par41">For each grid cell, we computed mean daily temperatures from the daily max and min temperature provided by the NEX-GDDP data, and then sum the annual days of exposure to average temperatures &lt;12.5 °C and &gt;27.5 °C. In our 2050 no climate-change baseline scenario, each grid cell’s vector of temperature exposures was assumed to remain at its 2006–2015 average value. To construct ensemble projections of climate-change impact, we computed the difference between each grid cell’s NEX-GDDP projected annual exposure and its baseline exposure over the period 2040–2060 and combined the results with our empirically derived long-run temperature elasticities of energy demand to generate gridded maps of annual changes in energy carrier
