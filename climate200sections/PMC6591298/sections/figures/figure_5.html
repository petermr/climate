 <caption> Exposure of people with different adaptation challenges to changes in energy demand. Cumulative distribution of the number of people exposed to percentage change in climate-related final energy demand by country GDP per capita. Panels represent global results ( a) and three major developing world regions: Asia ( b), South America ( c), and Middle East and Africa ( d). Lines indicate the multi-model mean and all individual 21 CMIP5 models by 2050 under RCP 8.5. Present-day World Bank definitions for GDP per capita were used to classify countries in income categories, which we used as a proxy for adaptation challenges (GDP per capita &lt;6000 USD/yr for high-adaptation challenge, 6000–15,000 USD/yr for moderate-adaptation challenge, and &gt;15,000 USD/yr for low-adaptation challenge, see Supplementary Note  2 for detailed discussion). Supplementary Fig.  3 presents a version of this figure for RCP 4.5 and Supplementary Figs  1, 2 present the results by sector and fuel </caption>
