 <caption> Changes in the main drivers of energy demand between 2010 and 2050. The data are smoothed and summarized by latitude: population ( a), GDP per capita ( b), baseline projections of the total climate-related final energy demand without climate-change impacts as a result of combining our elasticities with GDP and population projections ( c) number of days with daily average temperature above 27.5 °C ( d), number of days with daily average temperature below 12.5 °C ( e) under RCP 8.5. Supplementary Fig.  6 provides a version of this figure for RCP 4.5 </caption>
