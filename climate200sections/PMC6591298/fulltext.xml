We combine econometrically estimated responses of energy use to income, hot and cold days with future projections of spatial population and national income under five socioeconomic scenarios and temperature increases around 2050 for two emission scenarios simulated by 21 Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we show that, across 210 realizations of socioeconomic and climate scenarios, vigorous (moderate) warming increases global climate-exposed energy demand before adaptation around 2050 by 25&#x02013;58% (11&#x02013;27%), on top of a factor 1.7&#x02013;2.8 increase above present-day due to socioeconomic developments.

Population expansion, economic growth, shifts in the sectoral composition of economies, behavior of individuals and organizations, and the pace of technological development are multiple sources of uncertainty that will interact to determine future demand of different energy sources across regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

To characterize the interactions among these multiple sources of uncertainty, we leverage on the new socioeconomic (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, SSPs) and climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and combine empirically derived reduced-form responses of sectoral energy demand by fuel with climatological exposures and socioeconomic variables. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways are a set of socioeconomic and GHG emission scenarios that have been developed by the research community at the request of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and that are used to make scenario-based mitigation and impacts studies more comparable across the literature.</p><p id="Par5">We follow a top&#x02013;down methodology as described in Swan and Ugursal (2009)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, increasingly being used as a computationally efficient alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> to process-based simulation models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Engineering bottom-up models are generally applied to specific countries or regions to simulate energy performance of specific buildings or building archetypes, and to forecast specific end uses in the near term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Top&#x02013;down models do not articulate end-use services, but rely on aggregate national statistics and macroeconomic drivers. When extending the time horizon to the long term, bottom-up models also face the issue of technological and behavioral uncertainty, often being addressed through stylized assumptions or reduced-form relationships between the parameter of interest and income<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. When aiming at depicting global trends, the much greater complexity and data requirements make it difficult to develop high-quality global bottom-up models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and more aggregated or statistical approaches are often preferred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

These intervening adjustments ultimately drive the economic impacts, such as changes in household incomes and welfare.

This expansion is the largest for areas experiencing small changes in hot or cold days (&#x0003c;10), reflecting the fact that at mid-century, most grid cells experience only modest changes in temperature, especially under the moderate RCP 4.5 scenario. The SSP-specific multi-ESM means (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d, g, h</xref>) suggest that socioeconomic forces shift this pattern monotonically, with the largest (smallest) absolute quantity of energy demand exposed under the rapid economic growth (population growth) SSP5 (SSP3) scenario.

The most important contributors to changes in global demand are industry and services (both net positive). The contributions of residences and especially agriculture are small and net negative. For residence, this is due to the lack of significant elasticities in our data set. For agriculture, this differs from the scarce existing literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, as we include multiple energy carriers that change in opposite directions. Electricity demand expands in every sector. Commercial electricity accounts for 80% of the global total climate-driven energy demand increase. Sectoral changes in natural gas demand are small and offset one another (positive in industry and negative in households). These impacts differ only slightly across socioeconomic scenarios, with households and services exhibiting the largest variation. Differences among ESM realizations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, error bars) are much larger. The cross-ESM distributions of demand impacts for industry, services, and the economy-wide total are long-tailed&#x02014;particularly for electricity relative to other energy carriers&#x02014;with a small number of climate model projections accounting for large increases in demand.

The resulting estimates are potentially subject to spatial and temporal aggregation bias. Large countries that span different climatic zones or incorporate regions that vary in the size and characteristics of stocks of energy-using durables (e.g., air conditioners, insulation) exhibit heterogeneous local energy demand responses to temperature.

We exploit this property to reconcile top&#x02013;down and bottom-up estimates of the response of annual electricity demand to warming (see Supplementary Note&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

This assumption likely overestimates the response of demand to warming, but lack of availability of local data makes it impossible to assess the magnitude and geographic distribution of the resulting bias. Our findings should thus be interpreted as worst-case projections of the impact of a given amount of warming, especially in tropical and subtropical regions that see large increases in extreme high-temperature days.</p><p id="Par26">Our work shows that it is possible to identify a globally comprehensive relationship between temperature and energy, and what the potential consequences would be in the light of climatic and socioeconomic uncertainties, but also shows that better data availability would greatly enhance this work.

As early as mid-century, there can be benefits to mitigating climate change (<italic>t</italic> tests indicate a statistically significant 14&#x02013;20% difference in the means of the distributions), but the associated costs depend critically on the uncertain greenhouse gas intensity of electricity generation that satisfies the anticipated large increases in future demand. Such increased electricity consumption does not translate one-to-one in carbon emissions, as, depending on the merit order, higher or lower carbon-intense electricity production technologies might be dominant. Similarly, adapting to an uncertain climate poses a monumental challenge to energy supply and infrastructure development planning: for RCP 8.5 (RCP 4.5), worst-case amplification among the CMIP5 ESMs of the 2010&#x02013;2050 change in ex-ante total final energy demand is 150% (41%) globally, and across regions, 265% (68%), concentrated in Asia, generally in line with the recent IEA cooling demand outlook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Such uncertainties, stemming from the ensemble of ESMs, dwarf the uncertainties in percentage and absolute impacts due to differences in sectoral composition of countries&#x02019; energy systems under the various SSPs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Urbanization is implicit in our methodology, as future temperature fields are population-weighted, and the spatial distribution of population varies across SSPs along with country-level population trends, which do play a large role in the underlying SSP projections. Across the SSPs, urbanization levels vary widely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, with low urbanization in SSP3 and high urbanization in SSP1 and SSP5. Urbanization drives the location of population in the SSP spatial population projections, where they are allocated from the national level to individual grid cells. In our projections, urbanization determines to which temperature changes people are exposed, and temperature changes in urban grid cells are more dominant in higher-urbanization scenarios.</p><p id="Par29">Future climate change is likely to affect energy use in the transport sector as well, but as suggested in DCSW, the underlying drivers remain opaque. On the one hand, people occupying vehicles modify cooling and heating while driving to maintain thermal comfort. On the other hand, when faced with extreme cold or hot weather conditions, they might simply make different mobility choices (e.g., drive more, or do not drive at all). Weather traditionally does not enter the model of the demand for transportation, and temperature-related energy use is marginal for transportation purposes. Since our projection methodology cannot discern the fraction of energy that is sensitive to variations in weather, we focus on the final sectors where temperature more directly affects the climate-sensitive energy use. The dynamics of the transport sector are more complex and sub-sector-specific (e.g., fright transport would have different dynamics compared with personal mobility choices. In the residential sector demand for mobility, services would also interact with leisure-labor choices), calling for dedicated studies first identifying the underlying mechanisms at play, and subsequently evaluating them empirically.</p><p id="Par30">We conclude by emphasizing that our results indicate the potential, ex-ante impacts of climate change, prior to any direct or indirect adaptation measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, representing the first step of a full-impact analysis. The present impact estimates are key inputs to the Integrated Assessment Model or CGE model simulations, which can examine the shifts in economic structure or technology between socioeconomic and climate scenarios driven by our ex ante shocks. Rebound effects and price changes will also dampen the consequent changes energy demand, further influencing the gap between our projections and ex post outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Given these considerations, our findings should be interpreted not as future physical changes in energy use, but as the changes in demand that, without price, substitution, and induced technical change adjustments, would maintain the level of economic services delivered by energy systems in the baseline scenario, if they were subjected to temperature shocks. Within CGE models, a practical way to operationalize such impacts could be technological shift parameters that lower the productivity of energy inputs to sectoral economic activities by the warranted percentage increase in energy demand, and vice versa. Induced technological change could then be modeled as a structural process that generates ex post modifications of such productivity shifts, following the practices of bottom-up approaches.</p><p id="Par31">The emission consequences of our projected climate-driven expansion of global fossil fuel demand give rise to a fundamental tension between mitigating and adapting to higher temperatures. Follow-up investigations using IAM simulations to characterize the balance of these forces and its implications for the joint costs of mitigation and adaptation have just started to appear in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> derived econometric estimates of per-capita demand for three different final energy carriers associated with heating and cooling in four economic sectors for temperate and tropical countries as a function of per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and exposure to hot (&#x0003e;27.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) and cold (&#x0003c;12.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) days.

DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> uses unbalanced panel data of energy demand, income per capita, prices, and weather covariates for 204 countries over the period 1970&#x02013;2014 (see detailed references in DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>) to estimate income elasticities and temperature semi-elasticities of sectoral energy demand across two regions (temperate, tropical), three energy carriers (electricity, natural gas, and petroleum products), and four sectors (residential, commercial, industry, and agriculture). Differently from the customary approach used in the climate-economy literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> models, the relationship between energy demand, weather, income, and prices as a dynamic adjustment process. The adjustment in energy demand following a shock is not immediate, because of capital fixity and adjustments in expectations. At each point in time, changes in energy demand are a function of weather, income, and price shocks, as well as of the adjustment process induced by shocks that took place in the previous period (year). Adjustments in energy use to price, income, and weather shocks occur over time, in line with studies finding evidence of persistency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. DCSW estimates the model as a dynamic panel using an Error-Correction Model (ECM), which yields short- and long-run elasticities. Over the long run, adjustments on the extensive margin (e.g., purchase of air conditioners, improvements in energy efficiency) also affect the use of energy, and this additional effect is being captured by the long-run elasticities, which we use here in this paper. The ECM can also be represented as an Autoregressive-Distributed-Lag model, and it also allows obtaining statistical inference that is robust to nonstationary data. Long-run estimates can be seen as a weighted average of elasticities estimated in the first difference or using a static model (Hendry, 1995<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, see also Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the estimated elasticities from the error-correction model (ECM) specification as reported in DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and compares them with elasticities obtained from the static and first-difference specifications. The semi-elasticities to temperature bins reported in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> suggest that temperature change has an influence on energy demand in 16 out of 24 energy carrier, sector, region combinations. Temperature semi-elasticities indicate that energy carrier demands tend to increase with hot days with a magnitude that varies among energy carriers and sectors. Responses to hot and cold days are asymmetric, and depending on whether an energy carrier is mostly used for heating or cooling, response in one or both directions can be significant. Several semi-elasticities to cold days are negative, suggesting that extreme cold weather could reduce energy demand, especially in production processes in industry and agriculture. The negative estimates can be due to reduced energy consumption for cooling or irrigation during the shoulder seasons of spring and fall (e.g., reduction in electricity use in commercial activities, industry, and agriculture), or to fuel switching (e.g., from petroleum products to electricity in the commercial sector in the tropics). An increase in cold days can temporarily induce production activities to reduce their electricity demand and/or temporarily shift to cheaper sources such as natural gas. Moreover, commercial and industrial consumers may also have back-up energy generation.</p><p id="Par35">In this paper, we use the historical evidence on energy use over a period of about 30 years summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> as an analog of how we might use energy in the future over the next 30 years to generate a set of counterfactual scenarios aimed at exploring climate and socioeconomic uncertainty. Because the elasticities for cold and hot days are estimated individually, future impacts in response to changes in both hot and cold days can be reported individually or combined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Baseline projections</title><p id="Par36">To establish mid-century baseline energy demand in the absence of climate change, we applied income elasticities from DCSW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> to the increases in countries&#x02019; GDP per capita from 2010 to 2050 corresponding to each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenario, generating energy carrier <italic>x</italic> sector consumption growth factors that were used to scale each sector&#x02019;s per-capita energy demand from its 2010 level. The resulting country-wide average values of per-capita demand for the three energy carriers by four sectors were then combined with gridded maps of future population under the SSPs to yield projected levels of energy demand across the globe on a 0.25&#x000b0; grid. Due to the lack of information for spatial distribution of energy demands, the energy demand in each grid cell is simply the national average energy demand per capita multiplied by the population in the grid cell.</p><p id="Par37">The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) that we used in this research have been developed by the climate research community as common basis across mitigation and impact research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The SSPs have diverging narratives that describe how these worlds evolve into high or low challenges to mitigation or adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. SSP1 represents a world with low socioeconomic challenges to both adaptation and mitigation. In SSP2, intermediate progresses have been made, and both adaptation and mitigation challenges remain at a medium level, whereas SSP3 represents a future with high challenges on both dimensions. In SSP4 and SSP5, adaptation or mitigation challenges dominate respectively. Several key variables have been projected forward for each of the SSPs. In this paper, we use SSP projections of future spatial population change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and GDP growth for 183 countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. A global summary of population and GDP of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways is shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> to indicate the wide variation between SSPs. There is some debate on whether each of the five SSPs can actually be combined with all levels of climate change from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (for details, see Figure 8 in Riahi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>). This is especially relevant for the highest-emission scenario, RCP8.5, which can only be reached under SSP5. However, the widest diversion between scenarios, both for the SSPs and the RCPs, takes place in the second half of the 21st century. In this paper, we only focus on results for mid-century, a period for which the potential inconsistency between SSPs and RCPs is much less clear. Moreover, we only use GDP and population from the SSPs and whether the projections for economy and population of 2050 are inconsistent with RCP8.5 levels of warming, is still an open question. Finally, in the structure of our impact analysis, the main difference between the SSPs are different distributions of population over the planet (i.e., different countries have higher/lower population growth) and different sectoral composition of energy demand, due to differences in economic growth. These are both relevant uncertainties to explore in the context of this impact study, and both these issues are not the main uncertainties with respect to (in-)consistency between the SSPs and RCP8.5.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Key global characteristics of the SSP quantifications for population, GDP, and GDP per capita</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Indicator</th><th>Year</th><th>SSP1</th><th>SSP2</th><th>SSP3</th><th>SSP4</th><th>SSP5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Population (million persons)</td><td>2010</td><td>6844</td><td>6844</td><td>6844</td><td>6844</td><td>6844</td></tr><tr><td>2050</td><td>8434</td><td>9137</td><td>9920</td><td>9095</td><td>8532</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">GDP (trillion USD<sub>2010</sub>)</td><td>2010</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>2050</td><td>285</td><td>230</td><td>177</td><td>219</td><td>361</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">GDP per capita (USD<sub>2010</sub>)</td><td>2010</td><td>9763</td><td>9763</td><td>9763</td><td>9763</td><td>9763</td></tr><tr><td>2050</td><td>33,742</td><td>25,142</td><td>17,871</td><td>24,104</td><td>42,303</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par38">Six Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) teams have published energy demand projection for the SSPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.
