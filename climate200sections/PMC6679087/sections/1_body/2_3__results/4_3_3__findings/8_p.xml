<p>For the studies using process-based models, findings were presented in a different manner. Khormi and Kumar observed that the Philippines had suitable to highly suitable conditions (i.e., ecoclimate conditions comprising mosquito growth and stress indices) for the mosquitoes to survive and for malaria transmission in the reference years of 1950–2000 [

 <italic>Anopheles</italic> in the Philippines because of changes in heat stress, causing large areas to have heat stress beyond the maximum survival values for the malaria vector (&gt;40°C) [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using the susceptible-infected-recovered (compartmental) model, Paynter et al. modeled the seasonal peak and troughs of respiratory syncytial virus transmission [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They found that rainfall seasonal troughs occurred consistently post 17–18 weeks after the centre of yearly RSV epidemics [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, they did not see such a lag pattern when visually compared to relative humidity, dew point, and mean temperature [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For the Buczak et al.’s prediction model using FARM, findings reported were about the model’s considerably high accuracy in predicting weekly dengue incidence in Philippines provinces four weeks in advance [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. They explained that creating rules/fuzzy sets of meteorological and climate parameters based on existing literature was enough to predict dengue outbreaks [
