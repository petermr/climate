<p>Four studies by Seposo et al. (2015, 2016, 2017, and 2017) explored the effects of extreme heat and heatwaves to mortality (i.e., due to diabetes and cardiovascular, respiratory, and multiple causes) in selected cities [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. They found that extreme temperatures (i.e., 95th and 99th percentiles of mean temperature) with a cumulative 15 day lag led to high risks in mortality [pooled RR of 2.48 (95% CI: 1.55–3.98)] [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the first temperature percentile RR was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.88–1.72) [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the city of Manila (capital of the Philippines), the effect modification of age in the 99th temperature percentile-mortality relationship were increasing with RRs of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.07–1.41) for ages of 0–14 years of age, 1.31 (95% CI: 1.18–1.46) for 15–64 years of age, and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.31–1.80) for &gt;64 years of age [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For diabetes mortality, the highest RR with extreme temperature was observed with a shorter cumulative lag of 7 days [RR: 1.61 (95% CI: 1.21–2.15)] compared to 21 days [RR: 1.55 (95% CI: 1.06–2.29)] [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, the heatwave effect to all-cause mortality was found to be insignificant and mostly negative [
