<p>Some of the between-maternal-line differences could be attributed to micro-habitat differences that were not measured (
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Frei 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). It is also possible that the same maternal lineage was unintentionally sampled multiple times within a site and presumed to be separate maternal lineages. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Liu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)
 </xref> found the cliff-dwelling herb 
 <italic>Oxyria sinensis</italic> has ramets that can occupy an area of 7–9 m and can be separated by distinct individuals that form their own patchwork of ramets, exploiting patchy resources within bedrock fissures (
 <xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Liu 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref92" ref-type="bibr">Poot 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012
 </xref>). Sampling related individuals or the same individuals at a site would increase

 <sup>2</sup>, which was small for most measures (
 <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As such, our sampling seems independent and appropriate for the species.
