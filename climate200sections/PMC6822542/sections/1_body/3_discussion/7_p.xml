<p>Cushion and mat-forming species such as 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> create microclimates that promote their own growth, and likely the growth of other plant species (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Kleier 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). This is especially important in many alpine and rock outcrop communities where suitable micro-habitat created by cushion and mat-forming plants facilitate their own productivity while increasing community diversity (
 <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Reid 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 </xref>). This results in relatively low ratios of agb:bgb competition (

 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Lavergne 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003
 </xref>) and also potentially increases the need for physiological integration, or sharing resources among stems within an individual (
 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Roiloa 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). We found that variation between maternal lineages or individuals within lineages helped explain responses to warming and drought (e.g. number of leaves produced, % C in leaves and WUE). This level of phenotypic variation created by maternal lineages may buffer 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> from the negative impacts of climate change, as has been shown to be the case in the alpine cushion 
 <italic>Silene acaulis</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref90" ref-type="bibr">Peterson 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
