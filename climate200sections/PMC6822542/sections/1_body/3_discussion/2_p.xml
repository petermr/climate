<p>Shifting how biomass is allocated during the seedling establishment phase can be crucial for survivorship (

 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> produced fewer leaves in individual and combined warming and drought treatments, the leaves they did produce were similar in specific leaf area and % of carbon compared to ambient treatment. We also found that 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> seedlings were able to maintain high WUE in response to the individual warming and drought treatments, which matched the compensating response in specific leaf area and carbon content. However, this relationship broke down in the combined warming and drought treatments, where 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> WUE was lower than ambient and warming and drought treatments. This matches expectations that intrinsic WUE decreases with increasing evaporative demand (

Furthermore, WUE in warming and drought treatments was likely compensated by structural changes (i.e. fewer leaves). This further reflects how phenotypic variability captured within (
