<p>Finally, it seems imperative that rare, endemic species should be assigned high priority for research efforts. Successful conservation efforts for rare and endemic taxa are dependent upon population estimates, distribution surveys and habitat characterizations that are currently lacking for many of Baja California’s endemic species (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>) and other sensitive plant and animal species around the globe (

 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Harper 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Studies like ours provide a small glimpse at species responses during a particular life stage, albeit an important phase for this likely long-lived cushion species. Additional work is required to examine 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> in its natural environment. Research should address the role microhabitats play in germination and establishment and the subsequent abiotic and biotic interactions that occur throughout an individual plant’s life cycle. Future research should also determine current population structure and potential impacts climate change may have on gene flow across this fragmented landscape.
