<p>Mortality was high in all warming and drought treatments. Recent work suggested that increased root length was the only trait that predicted seedling survival in response to drought in an annual grassland (

 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> bgb strategies may be relatively fixed compared to leaf strategies. This could be attributed to the specialized root system of 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic>, which is adapted to outcrop crevices and fissures (
