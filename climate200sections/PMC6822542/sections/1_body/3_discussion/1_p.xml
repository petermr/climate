<p>The ability of rare, endemic populations to regenerate in the face of climate change is poorly understood both from the perspective of biological constraints on performance and from the geometry of the environmental template. This is particularly true in high-altitude biodiversity hotspots like SSPM National Park in Baja California, MÃ©xico. There, fragmented alpine outcroppings dot mountain peaks and contain plant communities composed of chasmophytic specialists of which little is known beyond species descriptions and sparse locality data. We tested if phenotypic variation in early life history strategies may buffer populations of the cushion 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> by exposing seedlings to experimental warming and drought conditions. Overall reductions in biomass corresponded to reduced investment in photosynthetic surfaces, which likely served to reduce potential water stress, but constrained plant size. Individuals maintained high specific leaf area and similar carbon concentrations in leaves across treatments, further suggesting that plants were able to at least temporarily respond to the negative effects of treatments by altering morphologies. Individual plants exhibited decreased leaf-level WUE in response to combined warming and drought treatments but maintained relatively high WUE in response to warming and drought separately, suggesting that the species may be able to tolerate warming or drought but not both. Seedling mortality was three times higher in warming and drought treatments, further suggesting that 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> will likely experience population declines as new seedlings fail to persist in a warmer, drier climate. Overall, these phenotypic adjustments may be enough to enable the species to response to climate change in the short term, but the overall impacts of climate change at the population-level may not be enough to persist across longer timescales.
