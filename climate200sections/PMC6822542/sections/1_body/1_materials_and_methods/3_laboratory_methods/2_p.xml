<p>Seedlings were transplanted to larger containers (12 × 13 × 12 cm) after 1 month in the greenhouse and assigned to treatment conditions in growth chambers. We randomly assigned 30 individuals to each of four treatments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 120): ambient control, warming, drought and warming + drought (W + D). Treatments were carried out in experimental growth chambers, and plants were rotated weekly to account for potential small-scale variation in chambers. Ambient temperature and precipitation levels were determined using historical climate data for August averaged over 7 years (2007–2014;

The control chamber was set to simulate late summer growing season conditions in SSPM and was set to a daytime temperature of 17.6 °C and a night-time temperature of 11.9 °C. We simulated ambient precipitation by watering plants with 20 mm of water weekly (ambient and warming treatments). Heating treatments simulated a predicted +4 °C temperature increase for the region of Baja California that includes SSPM (

Drought treatments followed the highest predictions of a 50% decrease in mean annual precipitation, and plants received 20 mm of water every other week (drought and W + D treatments;
