<p>We first soaked 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> seeds in a 1% bleach solution for 3 min prior to sowing to decrease the occurrence of mould. We initially ran germination trials in growth chambers to infer optimal requirements for germination by replicating typical conditions the seeds would experience in SSPM if they germinated early in the spring after snowmelt (8.1 °C during the day and 1.0 °C at night on a 12:12 day:night cycle), during the early summer (13.2 °C during the day and 6.0 °C at night on a 14:10 day:night cycle), or during late summer when monsoonal precipitation reaches its peak (17.6 °C during the day and 11.9 °C at night with a 13.5:10.5 day:night cycle;

After 2 weeks, no germination had occurred in either the early spring or early summer chambers but seedlings had emerged in late summer conditions, which matched conditions in the UC Irvine greenhouse in May–June when this experiment began. Thus, to maximize space, 1200 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> seeds were sown in the UC Irvine greenhouse into individual 5 × 5 × 8-cm containers filled with a custom made 3:3:2:3 soil mix of redwood chips:dried moss:sand:perlite. Seeds were buried in the top 2 cm of soil and were watered regularly to keep containers moist until germination occurred and seedlings established up to 1 month. The ten sampling sites and maternal lineages were randomly placed on greenhouse benches, and containers were randomly rotated weekly to control for potential spatial heterogeneity in conditions in the greenhouse. Greenhouse temperatures during germination and the first month of growth were similar to August temperatures in SSPM (averaging 18 °C daily and 12 °C nightly in the greenhouse;

We chose a greenhouse in part not only due to constraints on conducting such an experiment in the field but also in an effort to more rapidly and accurately simulate climate change conditions and reduce variability in biotic and abiotic factors that may have reduced treatment effects (
