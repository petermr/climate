<p>The best model for each response variable was subsequently used to test treatment effects. We did this by employing the ANOVA function in the lmerTest package (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>) with Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom. We again extracted the variance components from each model to determine how much of the observed variation in each response variable could be attributed to maternal effects (environmental, genetic or error) from locations and maternal lines that seeds were collected from. To test fixed effects for our mortality model, we used a type-III ANOVA using Wald χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests in the car package (

 <italic>post hoc</italic> pairwise comparison tests and accounted for multiple comparisons by adjusting 
 <italic>P</italic> values with the Holm method to determine significance among treatment groups using the lsmeans package in R (
 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Lenth, 2017</xref>). We did this for all variables used in mixed models as well as agb and bgb biomass in order to explore potential variable responses to treatments. All mixed models were built using the nlme package in R 3.3.2 (
