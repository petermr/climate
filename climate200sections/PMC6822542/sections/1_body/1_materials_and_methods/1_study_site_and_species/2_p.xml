 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> is a mat-forming, rhizomatous perennial first described in 1896 (
 <xref rid="ref103" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Freeman, 1896</xref> as 
 <italic>Chrysopsis brandegeei</italic> then as 
 <italic>H. martirensis</italic> in 
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1969</xref> and later reclassified in 
 <xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">Semple 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988
 </xref>). The species was described as flowering May to September, with thick, hirsute, spatulate leaves growing in clusters close to the ground (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This trait combination is somewhat unique to the genus but most similar morphologically to the similarly rare, endemic 
 <italic>H. jonesii</italic> in Utah (
 <xref rid="ref129" ref-type="bibr">Welsh 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 1975
 </xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">Semple 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1988)
 </xref> note that 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> is most similar to 
 <italic>H. viscida</italic>, which occurs on cliff crevices in the Sky Islands of Southern Arizona through to West Texas. Solitary flowers sit on relatively slender, glandular peduncles up to 6 cm tall and produce disc achenes that are similar to related wind-dispersed asters (

 <xref rid="ref103" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Freeman, 1896</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1969</xref>). The species was said to be common in crevices on flat granitic surfaces above 2800 m when it was described in 1969. 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> is common on rocks in full sun or partial shade from 2050 to 2800 m asl and, before this study, was known from only six sites (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1969</xref>; but see 
 <xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">Rebman 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). These rock outcroppings are often dominated by other endemics including 
 <italic>Stephanomeria monocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>Sphaeromeria martirensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Stenotus pulvinatus</italic>, and non-endemics 
 <italic>Selaginella asprella</italic>, 
 <italic>Potentilla wheeleri</italic>, 
 <italic>Sedum niveum</italic> and 
 <italic>Myriopteris wootonii</italic> among others (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1969</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Delgadillo, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref123" ref-type="bibr">Thorne 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 </xref>). Communities in which 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> is found are more similar to damp meadows than to snowbed communities (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
