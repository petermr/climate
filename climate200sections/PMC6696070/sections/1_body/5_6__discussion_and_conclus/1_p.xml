<p>Climate change refers to the long-term and sudden fluctuations in weather conditions. These fluctuations can promote a suitable environment for the sustenance of pathogens and vectors, which ultimately result in outbreaks of various human diseases. Climate variables such as temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity constrain the spatiotemporal distribution of pathogens and their vectors. Any change in these climate variables can result in exponential reproduction, survival and distribution of disease-causing pathogens and intermediate hosts. Hazardous meteorological and weather events in combination have severe impacts on numerous infectious diseases and may increase the complications manifold. Thereby, it becomes imperative to develop relationships between climate change, pathogens, vectors, and related diseases.</p>
