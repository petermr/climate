<p>The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms searched in PubMed, ScienceDirect and PLOS were: Viral infections, bacterial infections, pathogens, vectors, parasites, rodents, infectious diseases, diseases, skin diseases. “PECOT” terms included population, exposure, comparison, outcome and time. Climatology terms included temperature, humidity, wind, rain, precipitation, climate, climatic, extreme weather; extreme weather events were also searched. Other keywords such as Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, Australia, Canada, United States, policies, adaptation, population, exposure, human, response, education, public health, social response, outcome and time were also searched. The mentioned terms were coherent with those used in the previous review [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but additional terms such as “policies,” “adaptation,” “social response,” “ocean warm-up,” “time,” “exposure,” and “population” were added. MeSH terms were preferred rather than individual keywords, as used in previous reviews [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As MeSH terms were used for the PubMed, ScienceDirect and PLOS searches, keywords contained significant phrases in the MeSH hierarchy. For instance, terms such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, lyme, encephalitis and zoonoses are all included in “infectious diseases”, a hierarchical MeSH phrase. The term “zoonoses” was not searched separately, rather the phrase “zoonotic diseases” was used because viral and bacterial infections and parasitic diseases all fall within their MeSH hierarchy.
