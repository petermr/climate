<p>Among all the mitigation measures for reducing the vulnerability of health risks associated with climate change, improved public health system and quality infrastructure are most significant [

Their inefficient public health systems in terms of resources, infrastructure and capabilities are the major cause of minimal resistance towards elevated health risks. It was the below par performance of public health services and lack of anti-malaria spraying that caused more than 75,000 cases of malaria after a hurricane incidence in 1963 in Haiti [
 <xref rid="B136-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Similar tragedy occurred in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua where dengue and malaria morbidity rates rapidly increased after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 [
 <xref rid="B137-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. A similar pattern was observed in the outbreak of 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> cholera after the earthquake and hurricane due to poor sanitary systems [
 <xref rid="B138-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. A striking increase in a group of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, measles, typhoid, malaria and paratyphoid fever were found after five months of hurricane calamity in Dominican Republic in 1979. It was believed that the major causes were crowded dwellings, poor sanitation, unhygienic food and water, and low immunization rates [

 <xref rid="B139-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. It is apparent that with quality public health services, advanced infrastructure, public programs and functions, and proper government monitoring, health risks associated with climate change can be potentially minimized.
