<p>Ever-increasing human population, unplanned urbanization, restricted habitats, improper land use, and climate are the major factors involved in the emergence and re-emergence of diseases [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The host can be any living macro-organism such as animals or plants. Vectors act as an intermediate host, which carry and transfer pathogen to host. This subsection explores the possible impacts that climate change and weather can impose on vectors. Past studies have provided enormous evidences of climate change impact over vectors and vector-borne diseases. These vectors are ectothermic in nature and therefore, their vectorial capacity greatly is affected by any change in temperature [
