<p>Temperature has a most significant impact on transmission and life cycle of pathogens. In a review study by Mellor and Leake, it was concluded that environmental temperature greatly controls the transmission of Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For example, at 28 °C, transmission of JEV by 
 <italic>Culex. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> was 60% and 100% after 9 and 14 days, respectively. However, at 20 °C, no transmission was recorded, even after 20 days of monitoring. Another study also highlighted that threshold temperatures i.e., a maximum of 22–23 °C for developing mosquitoes and a minimum of 25–26 °C for transmission of JEV determines the ecology of JEV [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Excessive temperature rise can also favor pathogens in their reproduction mechanism in terms of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, in the case of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, it is found that at 20 °C the EIP is around 26 days, which reduces to only 13 days at a temperature of 25 °C [
 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. During summer periods, an increase of about 40% infections associated with 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> was also found [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A similar dependence of increasing temperature on 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> bloodstream infection was also investigated by Anderson et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A positive relationship between warm wet season and growth of 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. related infectious diseases were also revealed by Allen at al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. There are also some positive implications of extreme heat and mortality rates for some pathogens [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For instance, the growth of parasites such as 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. associated with malaria minimizes when temperatures surmount 38–39 °C [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Global warming might also induce genetic modifications in pathogens like chikungunya viruses, which might make them more resilient and reproduce at faster rate [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Extreme hot weather is reported to have adverse impacts on aquatic environments, often leading to an exponential rise in microorganisms. It was found that the growth rate of 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. was much higher on hotter days when compared to normal days [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A positive correlation has been identified between 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. growth and water temperatures, whereas in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, it was negative [
 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. El-Fadel et al. developed a Poisson generalized linear model to identify and predict the relationship between water- and food-borne morbidity rates and associated high temperatures [
 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. It has been observed that morbidity rates decrease to a threshold temperature of 19.2 °C and then increases with temperature. It has also been predicted that by the year 2050, water and food-borne morbidity rates will rise to 28%, which can further increase to 42% by the end of 2100.
