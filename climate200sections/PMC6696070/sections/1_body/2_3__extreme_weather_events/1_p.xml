On a broader basis, these events can be categorized as global scale extreme events like El Nino, La Nina and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), and regional scale events such as floods, droughts, and shift in precipitation and drought.

Extreme weather events may not only result in the huge spread of diseases through the increased growth of vectors, pathogens, viruses, and transmission routes, but can also cause a breakdown of public health infrastructure, loss of sanitation and hygiene, shortage of drinking water supply, and increased concentration of people.
