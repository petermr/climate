  <bold>Funding:</bold> E.B. received funding from the Volkswagen Foundations CE:LLO project (Az.: 88468) and M.V. from the “EUPHEME” ERA4CS project. 
  <bold>Author contributions:</bold> E.B. and D.M. had the idea of the study and designed the work. E.B. carried out the data analysis. E.B. wrote the paper with D.M. and with contributions from M.I.V. E.B. performed the astronomical tide simulations, M.I.V. and E.V. performed storm surge runs, and L.M. performed the wave runs. E.V., L.M., and M.I.V. collected the observed sea level data and derived the observed astronomical tides. M.V. gave conceptual inputs during the data analysis. All authors discussed the results and commented on the manuscript. 
  <bold>Competing interests:</bold> The authors declare that they have no competing interests. 
  <bold>Data and materials availability:</bold> All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials. The statistical analyses were carried out using the R packages cited in Materials and Methods. Custom codes developed for the analyses are available from the corresponding author. Precipitation data from CMIP5 models are available from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Peer-to-Peer system (
