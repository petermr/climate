<p>This continental study comes with some inevitable limitations mainly related to the resolution of the input data and the omission of the nonlinear interactions between the different physical factors leading to CF; i.e., SLR, astronomical tides, waves, storm surges, precipitation, and hydrology. Coupled modeling of the above could improve the accuracy of the CF assessment but was not feasible given the available computational and storage capabilities. The same applies to the use of higher-resolution forcing data and models, which would improve the representation of precipitation (

 </xref>). Our study analyzed the probability of potential CF, i.e., focusing on the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological drivers of flooding. Therefore, our findings cannot directly be interpreted as projections of actual flood risk, since the latter is a complex phenomenon depending on several other factors not presently considered, e.g., the topography and the presence of protection. If a particular site is not prone to surges, e.g., because of the local cliffs, and fluvial or pluvial flooding, the CF hazard may be negligible, although we identified a high potential CF hazard. However, the above shortcomings are common in large-scale studies like the present, which provides a pan-European assessment of the CF hazard in view of climate change.
