<p>Precipitation was taken from the grid point nearest to each coastal location and, on each day, we considered accumulated precipitation within a time range of Â±1 days. This choice allows for indirectly accounting for a range of large-scale weather systems that may produce CF. Grid point precipitation represents a rather large area of typically well beyond 100 km by 100 km. In a moving cyclone, precipitation at the daily scale is strongly correlated in space, and in particular, 3-day aggregated precipitation represents a large area quite far upwind. In addition, we accounted for very heavy precipitation falling in convective cells embedded in a large-scale weather system; these events would show up as heavy even in a 3-day aggregation and may cause CF in rather small catchments.</p>
