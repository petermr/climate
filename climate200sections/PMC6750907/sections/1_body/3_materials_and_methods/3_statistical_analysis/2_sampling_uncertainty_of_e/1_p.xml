<p>To obtain the 95% sampling uncertainty range of the ERA-Interim–based CF return periods in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, we applied a resampling procedure. The uncertainty was computed in the 11 representative locations whose return periods are shown in black in 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>. We based our estimate of sampling uncertainty on the previously generated 240 bivariate sea level/precipitation time series (where surge and precipitation are identical; only the astronomical tides were resampled). Each of these 240 bivariate time series were used for a further resampling procedure by combining bootstrapped numerator and denominator values of the return period expression (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E1">Eq. 1</xref>). The numerator-bootstrapped values of μ were obtained via resampling of the observed times elapsing between the selected pairs (

This procedure is preferred to a classic resampling of all the pairs, which, here, would bias the obtained median return period due to the serial correlation of the sea level time series. On the basis of a large sample of data without any serial correlation, we estimated that the 95% sampling uncertainty range is overestimated by 30% from our procedure (with respect to a classic resampling procedure). Thus, conclusions about the detection of a climate change signal in the future (
