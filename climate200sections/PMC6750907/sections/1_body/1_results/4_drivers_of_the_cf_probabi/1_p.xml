<p>Changes in CF probability can, in principle, be caused by changes in the probability of extreme sea levels and extreme precipitation, as well as in the dependence between both hazards (

 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), as a warmer atmosphere will allow storms to carry more moisture, resulting in heavier precipitation. This thermodynamic effect dominates along the North Atlantic storm track in Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean storm track (

 </xref>). Weaker upward winds will reverse the thermodynamic increases of extreme precipitation over northwestern Africa (

 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Reducing extreme sea levels cause a CF probability decrease along the Mediterranean coast, while the opposite is projected along the west coast of Great Britain and North Sea, and eastern coast of the Baltic Sea (
