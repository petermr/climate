<p>In a warmer future climate, the probability of CF is projected to robustly increase particularly along the west coast of Great Britain, northern France, the east and south coast of the North Sea, and the eastern half of the Black Sea (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The fraction of coastlines experiencing return periods lower than 6 years is projected to increase from presently 3 to 11% by the end of the 21st century. Hot spot regions where return periods will fall below this value are the Bristol Channel and the Devon and Cornwall coast in the United Kingdom, as well as the Dutch and German North Sea coast (
