<p>The highest CF probability in present climate is mainly concentrated along the Mediterranean Sea (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The Atlantic coast appears to be particularly exposed to co-occurring storm surges and extreme precipitation (fig. S6). But here, the effective probability is reduced because of the high tidal range (fig. S6): No CF occurs when the peak of the storm surge coincides with neap tides. In present climate, about 3% of the coastline experiences return periods of CF shorter than 6 years. These regions are the Gulf of Valencia (Spain), the northwestern Algeria, the Gulf of Lion (France), southeastern Italy, the northwest Aegean coast, southern Turkey, and the Levante region (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The statistical dependence between sea level and precipitation greatly enhances the probability of CF along the European coasts: When ignoring the dependence, the CF return period increases by up to two orders of magnitude (365 years is the expected return period in the independent case).
