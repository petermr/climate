 <caption> Future probability of potential compound flooding (CF). ( A) Multimodel mean of projected change (%) of CF return periods, between future (2070–2099) and present (1970–2004) climate. ( B) Return periods for the future (2070–2099). Gray points indicate locations where only four or fewer of six models agree on the sign of the return period change (three or less of five models in the Black Sea). Areas of gray points in (A) and (B) are slightly different, as the former are computed taking into account the past period (1970–2004) and the latter the period (1980–2004) (see delta change approach in Materials and Methods). ( C) Median value of CF return periods over regions defined in (B) for past [1980–2014, based on ERA-Interim ( Fig. 2)] and future (2070–2099) climate, separately for individual models. For ERA-Interim, gray shading illustrates the sampling uncertainty 95% range. </caption>
