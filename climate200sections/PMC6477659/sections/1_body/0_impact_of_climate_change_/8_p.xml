<p>Besides the decrease in productivity and plant performance, alterations in fruit quality will also impact farmers’ income and competitiveness. Harvesting periods of certain fruit varieties (e.g., citrus) are established in relation to their optimal ripening and so are the farmers’ efforts and distribution networks. This is likely to be dramatically altered by climate change conditions (
