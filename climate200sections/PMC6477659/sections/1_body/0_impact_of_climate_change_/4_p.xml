<p>Regarding the effects of increasing average temperatures on perennial cropping systems, it is important to note that the severity of the effects will depend on the phenological state: (a) in winter, these increases will affect early phenological events such as flower bud induction, (b) in spring, elevated temperatures could affect the persistence of already developed flowers and (c) during the fruit development phase, comprising fruit expansion and maturation, higher temperatures coupled to extreme isolated events could affect final yield and quality as well as plant performance (
