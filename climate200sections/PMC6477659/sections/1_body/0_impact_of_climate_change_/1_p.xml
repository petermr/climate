<p>Climate change is defined as identifiable long-term changes in the state of the climate, such as increased temperatures, atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels, precipitations, etc. (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">Korres et al., 2016</xref>). It is also important to note that although there are several natural causes behind climate change that occurred over Earth’s history, the ‘Climate Change’ concept refers to variations in climatic patterns occurring over the last century and caused by anthropogenic activities that release greenhouse gasses (e.g., CO
 <sub>2</sub>, CH
 <sub>3</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, etc.). Studies on climate change over the last two decades have rendered consistent projections that predicted a net increase of average temperatures and a significant variation in the patterns of precipitation (

Despite changes in the climatic patterns differ among world regions increasing evidence points that the Mediterranean area will be one of the most sensitive to the effects of climate change, the primary effects of which will be a decrease in rainfall and a sharp increase in temperatures (
