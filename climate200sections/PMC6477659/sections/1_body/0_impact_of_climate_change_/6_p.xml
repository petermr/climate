<p>The influence of changes in CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature on plant performance and/or productivity is genotype-dependent. Comparing responses of rice, soybean and citrus to combined high CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature, (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Baker and Allen, 1993</xref>) showed that citrus displayed the greatest increase in growth due to enhanced water use efficiency and photosynthetic rate associated to CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment. More recently, 
 <xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">Vu et al. (2002)</xref> showed that ‘ambersweet’ orange trees grown at high CO
 <sub>2</sub> (720 ppm) and temperature (up to 6°C above ambient) showed improved overall photosynthetic rate suggesting a good acclimation capacity of citrus to climate change conditions. In grapevine, FACE experiments (Free Air CO
 <sub>2</sub> Enrichment) had shown that increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> may stimulate wine grape production without causing negative repercussions in table grape or wine quality (

 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">Moutinho-Pereira et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly to citrus, the combination of high temperature and CO
 <sub>2</sub> had no deleterious effect in grapevine yield (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Kizildeniz et al., 2018</xref>), contrary to water stress that significantly affected yield when applied along with elevated temperature. The available reports on olive trees indicate a similar behavior to atmosphere CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment (
