<p>These adverse conditions will influence productivity by affecting overall plant performance but also influencing phenology (especially relevant to perennial crops). To this respect, alteration of the climatic patterns leading to an extended growth season with no quiescence period (cold season) could dramatically reduce productivity and/or quality of the production (

 <sub>2</sub> fertilization and the extension of growing season which could improve yields in some species or circumstances (
