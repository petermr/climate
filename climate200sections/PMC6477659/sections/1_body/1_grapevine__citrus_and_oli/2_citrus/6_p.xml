<p>The effect of high temperatures during fruit set, which has a direct influence on final production and quality, has not been extensively studied. Nevertheless, higher fruit drop rates are an expectable consequence of elevated temperatures during Mayâ€“June. Fruit set is regulated by a series of factors (number of flowers, competition between reproductive organs, plant hormones, and crop load) that are, to some extent, manageable. Efficient fruit set appears to be a result of a complex interplay of several plant hormones (

On the other hand, environmental factors, such as high temperatures that increase evaporative demand, cannot be controlled and need to be overcome by the available means (
