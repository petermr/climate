<p>At present, Mediterranean citrus fruit production and commercialization is focused on delivering the maximum fresh fruit quality, including external appearance (such as shape, texture, and color) and taste characteristics (sugar content, acidity etc.) as the main quality traits that must fit stringent parameters to successfully reach the market. To accomplish this goal, citrus production has been subjected to extensive technification including the accurate selection of genotypes to be used as rootstocks, providing adequate yield and plant performance traits to the grafted variety.</p>
