<p>A warmer climate will affect fruit metabolism in terms of yield but also influence internal quality in several ways. High average temperatures increase sugar content and reduce acidity. This is probably linked to enhanced photosynthetic and fruit sink activities along with citric acid metabolism (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Cercós et al., 2006</xref>). The ratio between total titrable acidity (TTA) and total soluble solids (TSS) is the main parameter used to determine optimal fruit maturity for harvesting. Hence, the adequate balance between sugars and citric acid, confers the characteristic flavor of citrus in temperate world regions in clear contrast to those produced in tropical areas (
