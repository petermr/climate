<p>Water scarcity due to rainfall reduction is the other main threat to olive production. Water stress not only has a negative impact on flowering but also reduces stomatal aperture and carbon assimilation (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Hernandez-Santana et al., 2017</xref>). At present, intensification is rapidly shifting the cultivation method from extensive rain-fed groves to irrigated orchards; therefore, the forecasted reduction in water availability will require the generalization of water-saving irrigation techniques. To this respect, regulated deficit irrigation can save considerable amount of water in high-density orchards without significant yield penalty (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-del-Campo, 2013</xref>). Hence, alternating partial root-zone drying, in which a reduced amount of water is applied to half of the root system, switching sides periodically, can increase notably water use efficiency in olive trees, being alternation timing a key factor in determining the results (
 <xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">Wahbi et al., 2005</xref>). The implementation of new, more precise, irrigation scheduling tools as well as the generation of new knowledge on physiological responses to water deficits might contribute to improve the efficiency of this strategy (
