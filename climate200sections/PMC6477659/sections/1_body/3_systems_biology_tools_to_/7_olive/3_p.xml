<p>Until recently, genomic studies in olive focused mainly on the employment of molecular markers toward identification of genetic variability, olive oil traceability and parental progeny analysis to aid in genetic improvement programs (

Nevertheless, as in citrus, pre-genomic molecular biology was still possible with different EST collections whose components were functionally annotated by means of ortholog BLAST search. In a series of experiments carried out using two

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Bazakos et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the resulting expression data was integrated using network analysis to infer regulatory processes aiming at inducing adaptive responses. As a result, several homologs of ERF, bZIP, and NF-Y TFs families were characterized. In other plant species, ERF TFs are known to regulate ABA biosynthesis in a stress-related manner. In turn, bZIPs appeared to act as master regulators of other TFs within the gene regulatory network, seemingly acting upstream the olive tree ERF homolog. As a result of this study, it was shown that NF-Y TF is located at the uppermost hierarchical position in the regulatory network potentially regulating rewiring of node connectivity in response to salt stress. In general, the salt-tolerant genotype exhibited a more complex TF interaction network than the salt-sensitive, suggesting the existence of a more orchestrated and progressive response to salt stress. More recently, another in-depth report made by the same authors employing 454 pyrosequencing (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Bazakos et al., 2015</xref>) reinforced and expanded the findings reported in the original 2012 manuscript. Notably, both transcriptomic analyses highlighted the involvement of the same members of the regulatory networks but the more recent study considerably extended the list of involved TFs including JERF, GRAS, and HMG homologs (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Bazakos et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, a significant cluster of ABA-related unique transcripts were identified, reinforcing the significant role of ABA in salt stress responses and/or adaptation of olive trees to stressful conditions.
