<p>As in grapevine, most integrative studies have so far focused on fruit ripening and quality. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Ibáñez et al. (2014)</xref> integrated transcript and metabolite profiles to decipher the metabolic and physiological processes underlying citrus fruit rind puffing, a disorder that produces ‘swollen’ fruits that are usually rejected. A PPI analysis inferred from previous work on 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, revealed glycolysis and TCA as functional modules being severely affected in the puffing disorder. Moreover, this study also suggested that cytokinins and gibberellins could act repressing the symptoms of the puffing disorder (

In another work, postharvest disease resistance of thermally acclimated vs. non-acclimated fruits was investigated through the integration of proteomic and metabolomic profiles in satsuma mandarins. Proteins annotated as glucanases, class III chitinases and a 17.7 kDa heat shock protein were up-regulated in thermally acclimated fruits whereas enzymes involved in redox metabolism were downregulated (e.g., isoflavone reductase, superoxide dismutase, etc.). Protein data correlated with increased levels of fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, and different secondary metabolites known to be involved in reducing the effects of external stress (
