<p>Protein interaction with other proteins and other biomolecules is crucial in every cell process and understanding how these interactions take place is the ultimate goal of systems biology. To this respect, protein sequence and post-translational modifications (PTMs) are two essential aspects to consider. In recent works, 
 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">Tanou et al. (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B286" ref-type="bibr">Ziogas et al. (2015)</xref> investigated the occurrence of several PTMs in sour orange plants subjected to NaCl and PEG stress with/without pre-treatment with priming agents. Results indicated that carbonylation,
