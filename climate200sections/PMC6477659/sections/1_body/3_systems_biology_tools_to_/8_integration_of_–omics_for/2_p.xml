<p>This extent has been so far poorly investigated in woody crops despite similar approaches proved to be successful in identifying relevant genes in other plant species. In a pioneering study, 
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">Morreel et al. (2006)</xref> combined metabolite profiling and QTL analyses to identify loci controlling metabolite abundances in a full-sib poplar population. Metabolite correlation networks indicated a tight association of biosynthesis of specific flavones/dihydroflavonols and flavonols. More recently, integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics in co-expression analyses contributed to identify genes involved in side-chain elongation steps of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), revealing the importance of proteins involved in metabolite transport and degradation acting as hubs in the citrate accumulation gene network. In grapevine, integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed the involvement of typical abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors such as bZIPs, AP2/ERFs, MYBs and NACs in the accumulation of metabolites relevant to grape berry quality under unfavorable conditions (
 <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr">Savoi et al., 2017</xref>). Also in grapevine, integration of transcriptomics and proteomics allowed the identification of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms involved in the responses of grapevine to high temperatures. This study revealed that alternative splicing constitutes an important mechanism in the response of grapevine to climate change conditions (
