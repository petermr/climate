<p>The ultimate goal of plant systems biology is to fully understand how plants respond to their environment. To this respect, gene/trait expression, is a multi-scale and highly dynamic process consisting of several highly regulated steps (1) transcription, which is regulated through the interaction of TFs and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements present in DNA as well as epigenetic changes that modify DNA accessibility, (2) RNA processing through several post-transcriptional modifications such as the removal of introns or splicing, chemical modification of nucleotides (e.g., for rRNA) or the removal of particular sequences, allowing the acquisition of specific secondary structures (e.g., miRNA), (3) translation which is also influenced by proteins such as eukaryotic initiation factors involved in ribosome assembly and miRNAs and (4) post-translational modifications (partial proteolysis, phosphorylation, sumoylation, etc.) that affect protein activity. What is more, multidimensional interactions involving proteins, protein-nucleic acids and also different metabolites (regulatory compounds such as plant hormones, allosteric modifiers, etc.) need to be added. In such a complex regulatory scenario, the integration of â€“omics within network analysis provides a data-driven and dynamic scaffold to select relevant genes involved in the regulation and development of the phenotype.
