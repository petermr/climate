<p>Since the release of 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> genome in 2007 (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Jaillon et al., 2007</xref>), several efforts have been made toward the identification and functional annotation of all gene-encoding sequences (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Grimplet et al., 2012</xref>) including the genome-wide analysis of all potential 
 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (
 <xref rid="B268" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2017</xref>), miRNA-encoding sequences and their potential target genes (
 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">Jiu et al., 2015</xref>) and the specific study of several gene families associated to stress responses such as dehydrins(
 <xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), CBL, CIPKs (
 <xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">Xi et al., 2017</xref>), and CDPKs (
 <xref rid="B283" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) or involved in developmental processes such as MADs-box transcription factors (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Grimplet et al., 2016</xref>).
