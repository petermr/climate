<p>The power of network analysis to reveal novel interactions relies largely on the use and integration of several –omics technologies (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Fukushima and Kusano, 2014</xref>). These techniques provide an unbiased and non-targeted analysis of macromolecules and small molecular weight metabolites. To this respect, transcriptomics and metabolomics data can be combined to construct a network that displays the degree of association between genes and metabolites and depicts levels of co-expression among molecules. Nevertheless, it is important to note that network analysis only provides a reliable hypothesis since correlation does not necessarily implies causal relationship between the different components. Therefore, protein–protein (PPI), protein–DNA interaction studies as well as direct/reverse genetics approaches are required to confirm those interactions. Several online tools for network construction and analysis using co-expression data are available (
