<p>A few natural tetraploid olive trees have been identified in the 
 <italic>O. europea</italic> complex (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Besnard et al., 2007</xref>) or isolated from mixoploid mutants (
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">Rugini et al., 1996</xref>) showing a significant reduction of trunk and canopy size (
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">Rugini et al., 2016</xref>). The natural occurrence of polyploids in olive has been confirmed for different populations and subspecies, being triploids less frequent than tetraploid (
 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">Sebastiani and Busconi, 2017</xref>). It has been shown that tetraploidy induces changes in floral and fruit morphology, producing larger floral structures and increasing the pistil abortion rate compared to diploids, but surprisingly, no significant effect on fruit size could be observed (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Caporali et al., 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, no studies associating polyploidization with abiotic stress tolerance are currently available in grapevine or olive, although evidence from citrus and other experimental systems points toward a positive effect.
