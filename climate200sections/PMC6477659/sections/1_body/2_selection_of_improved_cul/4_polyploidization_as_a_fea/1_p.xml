<p>Polyploidy has been identified as a major force driving plant evolution in order to better adapt to environmental constraints (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2010</xref>). Polyploid species are common in harsh environments (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Brochmann et al., 2004</xref>) and investigations during the last decade showed that inducing polyploidization in diploid genomes improves stress tolerance in different woody plant species (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Allario et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Greer et al., 2018</xref>). However, investigation on the role of polyploidization in stress tolerance is hampered in part by the phylogenomic history of the given plant species, the biology and the particular genetic structure (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Jackson and Chen, 2010</xref>). To this respect, citrus have the advantage that, although most cultivated genotypes are diploid, apomictic seeds produced in several citrus species exhibit the natural occurrence of polyploids (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Aleza et al., 2011</xref>). This has boosted the selection and investigation of polyploids in citrus as a feasible alternative in breeding.
