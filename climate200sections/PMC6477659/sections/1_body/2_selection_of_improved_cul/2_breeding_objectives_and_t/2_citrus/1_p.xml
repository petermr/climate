<p>The agro-morphologic variability of citrus is very large. Several sources of tolerance to abiotic stresses have been identified (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Krueger and Navarro, 2007</xref>): tolerance to salinity of Rangpur lime (
 <italic>Citrus limonia</italic> Osb.), 
 <italic>Citrus macrophylla</italic> Wester and Cleopatra mandarin (
 <italic>Citrus reshni</italic> Hort. Ex Tan.); tolerance to water deficit of Rangpur lime (
 <italic>C. limonia</italic> Osbeck) and the 
 <italic>Microcitrus</italic> and 
 <italic>Eremocitrus</italic> species; tolerance to iron chlorosis of Rough lemon (
 <italic>Citrus jambhiri</italic> Lush), 
 <italic>C. macrophylla</italic> Wester, Volkamer lemon (
 <italic>C. limonia</italic> Osbeck), and 
 <italic>C. amblycarpa</italic> (Hassk.) Ochse, cold tolerance of satsuma mandarins (
 <italic>Citrus unshiu</italic> Marc.), Kumquats (
 <italic>Fortunella</italic> sp.) and trifoliate orange, 
 <italic>Poncirus trifoliata</italic> (L.) Raf. This variability opens very broad prospects for the exploitation of citrus genetic resources for adaptation breeding particularly at the rootstock level (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Cimen and Yesiloglu, 2016</xref>). The facultative apomixes of many citrus species allow clonal rootstock propagation by seed and contributed to the generalization of grafting in the citrus industry. Sexual breeding programs carried out in Florida by the end of the 19th century provided several intergeneric (
 <italic>Citrus</italic> × 
 <italic>Poncirus</italic>) hybrids, still used nowadays as rootstocks in many countries. These include some citrumelos (
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> × 
 <italic>P. trifoliata</italic> cvs. Swingle, Sacaton and 4475) and, particularly, the citranges (
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> × 
 <italic>P. trifoliata</italic> cvs. Troyer, Carrizo and C-35). However, most of them present some susceptibility to adverse abiotic conditions (alkalinity, salt), urging the development of a new range of intergeneric (
 <italic>Citrus × Poncirus</italic>) hybrids. Crosses between mandarins and trifoliate orange appear very promising to combine tolerances to abiotic and biotic constraints both by sexual breeding or somatic hybridization (
