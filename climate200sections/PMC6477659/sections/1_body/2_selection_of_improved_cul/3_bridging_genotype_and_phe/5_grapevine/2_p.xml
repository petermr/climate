<p>Grapevine has a diploid genome (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19) and an estimated genome size of 500 Mbp. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers from genomic and Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) have been used to determine parent-progeny relationships, to develop databases of DNA profiles for cultivar identification and for genetic mapping (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adam-Blondon et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, numerous SNP markers were developed leading to the generation of SNP arrays for high throughput genotyping (

 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Laucou et al., 2018</xref>). Several genetic maps (

 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">Troggio et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">Wang J. et al., 2017</xref>) have been well established for 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic>, which allowed the International Grape Genome Program (IGGP) to recommend using numbering of linkage groups according to the map established by 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adam-Blondon et al. (2004)</xref>. A high resolution map was established from GBS data using a heterozygous mapping strategy (HetMappS; 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Hyma et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic maps of 
 <italic>Vitis amurensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Blasi et al., 2011</xref>), 
 <italic>V. rupestris</italic>, 
 <italic>Vitis arizonica</italic> (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Doucleff et al., 2004</xref>) and 
 <italic>Muscadina rotundifolia</italic> (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Blanc et al., 2012</xref>) have been also established. Physical maps have been implemented (
 <xref rid="B230" ref-type="bibr">Scalabrin et al., 2010</xref>) and a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic>) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype was released (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Jaillon et al., 2007</xref>) and further improved by (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Canaguier et al., 2017</xref>). A gene nomenclature system (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Grimplet et al., 2014</xref>) was implemented and a public grape genome browser
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn02">2</xref>
 </sup>. Using these available tools, sequence polymorphisms and structural variations among four Sardinian grapevine cultivars have been analyzed (
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">Mercenaro et al., 2017</xref>) and the contribution of ancestral wide species to grape breeding evaluated (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">Migicovsky et al., 2016</xref>).
