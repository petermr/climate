<p>The findings from the case studies showed that the cities tend to adopt climate policies as dropped from the national level, with a limited number of them having mechanisms at the city level (Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The situation was attributed to the manner in which international climate adaptation funding and assistance is oriented, with a country-level focus instead of focusing at the coalface at the local government level. Hence, this scenario makes it difficult to implement and sustain city-wide climate policies. The case studies showed that among the key factors to enhance climate adaptation are ‘the strengthening of institutions, well designed national and city-level planning and governance’ (Filho et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>:35). The next section focuses on the methodology applied for data collection and information generation as well as the analysis.
