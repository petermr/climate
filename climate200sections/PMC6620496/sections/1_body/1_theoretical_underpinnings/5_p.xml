<p>The fact that cities should adapt to climate change is no longer a matter of debate. In a recent publication by Filho et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the authors focused on strengthening climate change adaptation capacity in six African cities of Douala (Cameroon), Lagos City (Nigeria), Dar-es-Salaam (Tanzania), Accra (Ghana), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Mombasa (Kenya). A number of cities included in the case study are coastal cities like Cape Town. The authors realise that the extent of climate change vulnerability at any particular place (in this case, the Cape Town) is a function of the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts and floods, the portion of exposed city residents, the level of the cityâ€™s development, its wealth and economic conditions as well as prevailing political institutions and political will to prioritise adaptation strategies.
