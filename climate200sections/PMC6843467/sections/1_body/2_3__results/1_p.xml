<p>First, we analysed the predicted change in annual air temperatures for the three different cities based on the multi-model ensemble and two different RCPs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref> highlights the results of the multi-model ensemble for mean annual air temperatures for London, Luxembourg, and Rome. The future climate projections of the nested regional climate model approaches show increases of the mean annual air temperatures for all three cities and the two different RCPs. London shows a 30-year mean of 9.3 °C for the reference period. An increase of the mean annual air temperature of 1.5 °C until end of this century is predicted for RCP4.5 and 2.5 °C for RCP8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), respectively. With 8.1 °C, the reference period in Luxembourg is more than one degree colder than London but the projected increases for the RCPs are in comparable range at 1.6 °C (RCP4.5) and 2.8 °C (RCP8.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). Rome shows the highest increase from the reference period 1979–2000 (14.3 °C) to 2061–2090, with 1.8 °C (RCP4.5) and 4.5 °C (RCP8.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). All differences between the reference period and the three different future time spans for the three cities and two RCPs were statistically significant (
