 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the boxplots of mean anomalies of the WSDI per year with reference to the 30-year period 1971â€“2000. The number of days contributing to events where the maximum air temperature is higher than the 90th percentile of the reference period on more than six consecutive days increases. Even though the mean annual air temperatures for London increases less in both RCPs than for Luxembourg, the corresponding WSDI exhibits stronger increases.
