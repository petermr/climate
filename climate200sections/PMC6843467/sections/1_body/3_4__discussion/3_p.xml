<p>The projected changes in air temperature for the three different cities shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref> are in line with results from comparable studies for London [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Luxembourg [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Rome [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For London, an increase in the long-term annual mean air temperature by 1.5 °C for the RCP4.5 and 2.5 °C for the RCP8.5 is projected. Past research demonstrated that there is a clear link between increased mortality and increased air temperature and HWs [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and heat-related diseases like respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, there is a strong relationship between increased air temperatures and amplified near surface ozone concentrations that reinforce the negative health effects [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. According to recent studies in England and Wales the mortality increases by 2.1% for each 1 °C increase in air temperature above the 95th percentile of the average yearly temperature [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. With 1.6 °C and 2.8 °C the projected increase in air temperature is a bit more pronounced for Luxembourg. The consequences for the regional fauna and flora were analysed in different climate change impact studies in the past [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For Rome the highest anomalies of up to 4.5 °C were projected corresponding to results shown for the Mediterranean region [
