<p>The duration of the heat wave expressed as WSDI, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f002">Figure 2</xref>, can be used as a measure for how long the population is exposed to high levels of heat stress. A continuous increase in the WSDI could be observed for all cities with the highest anomalies for Rome and RCP8.5, which is consistent with the trends in the mean annual air temperature shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Long-term, continuous exposure to high ambient air temperatures—targeted by this index—during the nights can decrease sleep quality significantly [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] especially for older people [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The WSDI was already applied for the past climate worldwide based on the HadEX2 data set [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In Europe for the time span 1961–2010, positive trends between 2.3 and 2.9 days per decade [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] could be observed. The impacts of projected changes in air temperature based on that index were analysed e.g., for China [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], showing a statistically significant increase of 2.4 days per decade on average since 1961.
