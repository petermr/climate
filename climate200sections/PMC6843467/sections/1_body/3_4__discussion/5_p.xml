<p>The index shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f003">Figure 3</xref> comprises the absolute number of HWs per year (HW-N) and is strongly related to the index describing the number of days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f004">Figure 4</xref>) that contribute to HWs per year (HW-F). The absolute number of days that contribute to HWs influences the number and the duration of the events but HW-F is not equal to HW-D multiplied with HW-N, because HW-D indicates the duration of the longest event, not the average duration [
