<p>Climate warming will directly impact the probability of the occurrence of future extreme events and, thus, negatively impact different sectors like agriculture, ecosystems and human health [

Unfortunately, there is no standardized universal definition of HWs, meaning that direct comparisons between reported results are sometimes complicated, but the overall definition describes HWs as time spans of consecutive days with hotter conditions than usual [

To contribute to the unification efforts of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the indices defined by the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) were used in this study. In general, past heat waves are a well investigated phenomena, e.g., the Chicago HW from 1995 [
