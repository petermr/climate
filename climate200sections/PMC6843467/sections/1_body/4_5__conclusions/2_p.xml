<p>The influence of elevated heat stress on public health has been demonstrated in past studies. A better understanding of the health risks and health impacts of extreme events, combined with the knowledge of the expected changes for dedicated cities, is a prerequisite for further steps. Beside the necessary mitigation efforts, that must be undertaken to limit climate warming to a minimum, increased resilience and the formulation of appropriate adaptation measures is crucial to reducing negative health impacts in the future. Additionally, a science-based prioritisation of urban planning measures, implementation of heat warning systems and other effective public health actions will be possible based on such analysis. </p>
