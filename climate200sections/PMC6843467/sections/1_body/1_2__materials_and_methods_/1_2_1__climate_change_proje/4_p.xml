<p>The time series were extracted using a bilinear resampling algorithm (using the Climate Data Operators v1.8.1 software,

 <sup>2</sup>, were considered and averaged to daily spatial means with a linear distance weighing. Because of the low altitude of the cities no height correction was applied to account for altitudinal differences between the city centres and the actual RCM grid point altitudes. Also, because for this study relative differences between the future climate projections and the historical time spans are considered, a bias adjustment was not applied [

In model M13 leap years were not taken into account and in model M5 the first day (01.01.1971) was missing. Gaps due to leap years were filled via linear interpolation and the missing values for 1. January in M5 were replaced by the values of 2. January. No other gaps or missing values were detected in the time series of the air temperature data.
