<p>For this study, time series of daily maximum and minimum air temperature for London (51°30’ N 0°5’ E), Luxembourg (49°36’ N 6°7’ E), and Rome (41°54’ N 12°30’ E) were extracted from a locally stored partial copy of the EURO-CORDEX data repository. Taking into account data availability at the time of retrieval in November 2018, 13 matching ensemble members (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03959-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), i.e. the same RCM with the same configuration, run by the same modelling group, were available overall from January 1971 to December 2090, for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 at a high spatial resolution of about 12 km. All EURO-CORDEX RCMs utilized are driven by r1i1p1 GCM ensemble members. We refrained from including the RCP2.6 scenario ensemble members in our study, because for that scenario only four ensemble members were available in the archive. As it is only possible to compare different scenarios when the same ensemble members were used for the analysis, and including RCP2.6 would have reduced the size of the ensemble substantially.
