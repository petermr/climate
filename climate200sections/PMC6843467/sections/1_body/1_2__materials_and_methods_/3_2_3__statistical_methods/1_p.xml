<p>The ClimPACT2 tool includes a test to detect outliers in the air temperature data time series. The criterion for detecting outliers can be defined by the user and is a certain number of standard deviation. In our study, we used the default value of 4 standard deviations to detect outliers. No outliers were detected in the input data sets. In addition, simple checks were performed, e.g., for cases where the maximum air temperature was below the minimum air temperature.</p>
