<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Climatology (CCI) Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) developed an internationally coordinated set of core climate indices in order to detect changes in climate extremes [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The general purpose of these indices is to extract useful information from a large data set of atmospheric variables. These indices are based on daily values of minimum and maximum air temperatures as well as daily precipitation totals. They have been widely used to detect and attribute climate change signals in historical data sets [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], climate change projections [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and of HW investigations [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These indices—relevant for HW—are used to analyse the projected changes in the heat stress level for three capital cities along a latitudinal transect across Europe.
