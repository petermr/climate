<p>In order to define adequate adaption and mitigation measures to reduce both the health risk and the negative economic impacts of HW, knowledge of the future frequency and intensity of such events is crucial. A multi model ensemble of transient regional climate change projections was retrieved from the public data archive of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The same set of ensemble members (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13) for two different climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5) were used to analyse past and future HW characteristics. A time series was created, covering the period from January 1971 to December 2091, consisting of daily minimum and maximum air temperatures.
