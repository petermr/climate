<p>Climate projections based on nested regional climate model approaches show increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme temperature events [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One of the major problems when analysing HWs and their impacts on society, is the definition of HWs. To date, there is no universally accepted definition of HWs. In general, an HW is a prolonged period of consecutive days with extremely high air temperatures for a specific region [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], taking into account that average conditions in one region, e.g., the Mediterranean, would be regarded as extreme conditions in another region, like Northern Europe. In order to make such comparisons possible across different countries, the use of individual threshold values is recommended to define HWs derived from site-specific data sets.
