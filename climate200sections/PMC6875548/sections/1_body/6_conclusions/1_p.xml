<p id="Par84">Our results show that the implications of potential socio-economic changes can intensify, weaken, or even reverse the effects of global warming. This underlines the need for impact studies to equally address both, climate change and socio-economic changes. Given the fact that the assessed impacts are very heterogeneous, which demonstrates the uniqueness and complexity of each catchment, we cannot formulate specific management recommendations at pan-European level, as initially intended. We would rather like to stress the importance of regional studies in the context of climate change adaptation or mitigation strategies for coastal areas.</p>
