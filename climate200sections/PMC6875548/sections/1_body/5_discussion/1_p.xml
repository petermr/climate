<p id="Par79">The results show that the assessed impacts in the different lagoons have been diverse and difficult to “generalize”. For instance, looking at the socio-economic impacts only, this is a consequence of different initial conditions in the four catchments that lead to different and partly even contrasting quantifications of the same socio-economic scenario. When it comes to the combined impacts, the climate change signals for precipitation across Europe can be considered as the main cause. The overall trends detected in this study—a decrease in precipitation in the
