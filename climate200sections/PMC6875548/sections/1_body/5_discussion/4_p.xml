<p id="Par82">Nevertheless, this study provides suitable measures for each of the four study areas to successfully face climate change impacts. For the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> lagoon, for example, deforestation in the central part of the catchment might have a positive effect (increase in total inflow) from a hydrological point of view. However, in case such a measure is considered the potential impacts for other important sectors, such as forestry, nature conservation, or tourism, to name only few, would have to be assessed first. Moreover, the effects of the increased inflow to the lagoon might not be necessarily beneficial for its salinity level, the hydrodynamics, the sediment loads, the shellfish breeding, or seaweed growth. In the case of the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment, an expansion of the already existing irrigation zone could mitigate negative climate change impacts on the groundwater levels by adding additional water from outside the catchment (Tagus-Segura IBWT) to the system. The 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> could receive more freshwater from its catchment under the projected dryer future if the effective volume of operating ponds is at least halved. Moreover, similar as in the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> catchment the groundwater resources could benefit if some forested area is converted to fallow. Apart from climate induced threats, the modeling suggests that a green corridor along the river could have a positive effect on the nutrient loadings to the lagoon (decrease nutrients), which might become important when future freshwater inflow decreases and nutrient concentrations increase. And finally, with regard to the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment, which seems not be threatened by climate change in the near future any reduction of point source and diffuse pollution is recommended, which of course is also the case for the other three catchments.
