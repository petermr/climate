<p id="Par22">It is recommended to use downscaled climate data for regional impact studies, as these have higher resolution compared with global circulation models (GCMs) (e.g., Giorgi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>; Christensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>; Tebaldi and Knutti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>; Teutschbein and Seibert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>). Moreover, the use of multiple scenarios is recommended, as it provides a variety of methods and boundary conditions that allows assessing, at least partly, the range of uncertainties related to climate modeling. The climate scenarios used in this study are GCMâ€“RCM projections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) from the ENSEMBLES project (van der Linden and Mitchell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>). They have a 25-km grid resolution and are based on the SRES A1B emission scenario, which is intermediate regarding atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> projection (Nakicenovic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2000</xref>). We applied scenarios from this generation because projections based on the downscaling models forced by GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>) were not available at the time the project started.
