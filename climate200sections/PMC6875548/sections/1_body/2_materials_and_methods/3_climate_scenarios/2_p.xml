<p id="Par23">The ability of the applied scenarios to simulate real climate in the four study areas is satisfactory with regard to the seasonal behavior of temperature and precipitation (Hesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). However, it can be rated as poor when the long-term average values of observed and simulated climate data are compared (Hesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). In three of the four catchments, the total annual precipitation is overestimated on average (
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> by 20%, 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> and 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> by 30% each), while it is underestimated for the fourth one (
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> by 10%). The simulated mean daily temperatures are on average about 1 °C higher compared with observed data for the catchments of 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> and 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic>, and about 0.3 °C lower than station data for the other two cases (Hesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>).
