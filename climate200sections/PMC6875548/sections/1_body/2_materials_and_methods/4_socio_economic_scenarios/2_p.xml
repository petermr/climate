<p id="Par32">By using the assumed relative changes in land use and applying a GIS tool new land use maps were created as input for SWIM. For that, soil quality criteria such as water holding capacity, terrain criteria such as morphology of the basin as well as the precipitation pattern were taken into consideration. Figure
