<p id="Par12">In order to address future challenges related to climatic and socio-economic changes in the four catchments, a calibrated eco-hydrological model of each study area is driven by a set of downscaled climate data for a reference (1970–2011) and a near future (2011–2040) scenario period under different land use and management settings (socio-economic scenarios). The assessment is performed for socio-economic impacts only and combined impacts of socio-economic and climate change, which allows us to analyze the sensitivity and vulnerability of water quantity and quality indicators toward climate change and anthropogenic interventions. An overview of the study framework is given in Fig.
