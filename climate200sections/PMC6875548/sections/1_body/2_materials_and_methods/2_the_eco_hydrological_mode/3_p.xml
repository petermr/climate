<p id="Par18">SWIM was setup for each study area individually considering specific characteristics of each study area. In the cases of the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> and 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> the WATCH climate data (Weedon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>) was used to drive SWIM due to poor coverage in time and space of the available climate station data. An overview of all data used to setup and drive SWIM for each of the four study areas is presented in Krysanova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">(2015b</xref>).
