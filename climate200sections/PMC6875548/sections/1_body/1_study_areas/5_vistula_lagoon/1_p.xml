<p id="Par11">The Vistula Lagoon has a transboundary catchment shared between Poland and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Since the political changes in the year 1989, small farms that are frequently run by elderly people have dominated the agricultural sector in the Polish part, whereas on the Russian side only half of the arable land is cultivated compared with USSR times (Różyński et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). Hence, the agricultural sector has no significant impact on the environmental conditions in the catchment. Nutrient pollution is mainly an issue on the Russian side, where waste waters have been discharged practically untreated into the rivers for several decades. Since June 2017, an urban waste water treatment plant (UWWTP) that is located in the city of Kaliningrad has been collecting and treating most of the effluents. Changes in the hydrological regime of the catchment on both sides (Poland: diversion of the major inflowing river, the Vistula, and its branches to the Baltic Sea; Kaliningrad: transfer of 40% of the discharge of Pregolya river to the neighboring Couronian Lagoon) have led to a deepening of the water body due to more frequent wind wave re-suspension causing bottom erosion (Chubarenko and Margoński
