<p id="Par71">This paper addresses the issue of including potential trends of economic development and environmental awareness in climate impact research. The study aims to provide a sound scientific basis for the development of pan-European management recommendations for coastal areas. We therefore assessed and compared the effects of climate change on water availability and nutrient loads under various land use and management settings in the catchments of four European lagoons: 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic>, 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic>, 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic>. Different setups of the eco-hydrological model SWIM, each representing one reference and four plausible socio-economic scenarios (the business as usual—BAU, crisis—CRI, managed horizons—MH, and set-aside—SET scenarios) for the four case study areas were driven by downscaled climate scenario data for a reference (1971–2000) and a near future scenario period (2011–2040).
