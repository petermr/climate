<p id="Par76">In the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment, the socio-economic scenarios cause different trends and climate change has relatively little additional impact. The nutrient loads decrease on average under the BAU, CRI, and SET scenarios, and increase under the MH scenario, except for ammonium that shows no change under this scenario, despite the fact that climate scenarios project a wetter climate for this region.
