<p id="Par2">While the use of climate scenarios in impact, adaptation, or vulnerability studies on water resources is well established, socio-economic scenarios are still given little attention. However, sound climate change impact assessments have to consider the implications of plausible socio-economic developments, since it is likely that societies will respond to climate change (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). Their responses will differ depending on the current socio-economic state and may considerably influence the environmental impacts of global warming. Or, seen from another perspective, climate change may intensify, weaken, or reverse certain environmental trends caused by human activities.
