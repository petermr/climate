<p id="Par53">In the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment agricultural land is slightly increased in the BAU and MH scenarios, which has no significant impact on the water cycle components. The LUCs in the CRI and especially the SET scenarios on the other hand lead to a clear decrease in RUN and GWR. In both scenarios agricultural land is reduced and mainly converted to fallow, which has higher rates of plant transpiration causing a reduction of water available for GWR. Moreover, in the SET scenario some parts of the agricultural land are converted to forest, which has the highest ETa rate of all vegetation types and thus contributes to the decrease in GWR while causing an increase in average ETa. The applied management changes in all four socio-economic scenarios are irrelevant for the water cycle. Furthermore, the precipitation and temperature trends (4% and 1.1 °C) in the combined scenarios cause an increase in all four components. We conclude that climate change is likely to reverse the trends caused by the CRI scenario and weaken the impacts induced by the SET scenario.
