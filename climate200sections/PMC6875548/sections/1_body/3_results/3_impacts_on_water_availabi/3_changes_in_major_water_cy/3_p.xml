<p id="Par51">In the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment both the socio-economic and climate scenarios have only marginal impacts on RUN and ETp, as it is already extremely dry under reference climate. The reduction of the irrigated area in the BAU, CRI, and SET scenarios causes a clear decrease in GWR and ETa. In combination with climate change these trends are intensified. Moreover, ETa decreases in areas that are excluded from the irrigation zone but still cultivated, as less water is available for evapotranspiration, and increases in regions, where nonirrigated agricultural land is converted to fallow due to higher transpiration rates. These effects are mostly compensated by climate change.
