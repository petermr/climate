<p id="Par41">The 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment is intensely managed and only about one third of the total inflow to the lagoon is generated naturally (Stefanova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2015</xref>). Consequently, the combined impacts do not differ much from the socio-economic impacts. The assumed changes in released water from the UWWTP and the extent of irrigated agricultural area are well reflected by the variations in the four variables. Q
 <sub>90</sub> and Q
 <sub>50</sub> respond slightly more sensitively to these changes than Q
 <sub>10</sub> and Q
 <sub>av</sub>, which is due to their dependency on infiltrated irrigation water and continuous input of water from the UWWTP. In contrast, changes in Q
 <sub>10</sub> and Q
 <sub>av</sub> are intensified or reversed some scenarios when climate change is added to the socio-economic impacts.
