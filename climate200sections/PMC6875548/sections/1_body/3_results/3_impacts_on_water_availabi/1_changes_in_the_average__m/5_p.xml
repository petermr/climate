<p id="Par43">In the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> case, a strong reduction of agricultural land (âˆ’50%) and its conversion to fallow and forest in the SET scenario lead to higher evapotranspiration rates and to a notable decrease in discharge. Climate change weakens this decrease, but the four variables still remain negative on average. With regard to the other three socio-economic scenarios, we observe an overall increase in discharge through the effect of climate change.
