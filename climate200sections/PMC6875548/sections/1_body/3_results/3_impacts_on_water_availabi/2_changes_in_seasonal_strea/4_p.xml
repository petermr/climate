<p id="Par47">Modeling results for the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> catchment under the combined scenarios suggest an average decrease in discharge throughout the year, irrespective of the socio-economic scenario. They indicate the smallest uncertainty for Q
 <sub>mam</sub> and the higher for Q
 <sub>jja</sub> and Q
 <sub>son</sub>, which corresponds well to the observed uncertainty in precipitation trends for these months.
