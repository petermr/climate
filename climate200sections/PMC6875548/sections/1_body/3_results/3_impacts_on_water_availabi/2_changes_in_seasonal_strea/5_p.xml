<p id="Par48">In the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment, most climate scenarios project an increase in Q
 <sub>son</sub> and Q
 <sub>djf</sub> for the BAU, CRI, and MH scenarios, and weaken the decreasing trend of the SET scenario. Only Q
 <sub>mam</sub> slightly decreases on average due to changes in snowfall and snowmelt processes. The disagreement between model outputs is larger for Q
 <sub>jja</sub> and Q
 <sub>son</sub> than for Q
 <sub>djf</sub> and Q
 <sub>mam</sub>, which is also the case for the disagreement between climate scenarios regarding seasonal trends in precipitation (compare with Fig.
