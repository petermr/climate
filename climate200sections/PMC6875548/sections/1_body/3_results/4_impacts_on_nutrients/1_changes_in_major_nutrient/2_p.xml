<p id="Par55">The reductions of agricultural land and fertilizers cause a decrease of nutrient loads to the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> (BAU, CRI, MH, and SET scenarios) and 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> (CRI and SET scenarios). In addition, the decrease of point sources assumed for all scenarios, except the CRI scenario in 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> also contributes to these trends. The observed impacts are further intensified under climate change, although the climate scenarios suggest a dryer climate for the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> catchment only.
