<p id="Par60">The results are very diverse and different for each study area, with the exception of phosphate transported with surface and subsurface runoff (P-RUN), which shows no changes at all. In the case of 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> the reduction of fertilized agricultural land (BAU, CRI, and SET scenarios) and of N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer (MH scenario) lead to lower denitrification rates (DENIT) in the catchment. The largest decrease is simulated for the CRI and SET scenarios, in which both agricultural land and N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer are reduced. DENIT declines only slightly in the BAU and MH scenarios, as agricultural land is reduced or remains constant, while N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer is increased or reduced, respectively.
