<p id="Par66">Contrary to the other three scenarios, the irrigated agricultural land increases in the MH scenario, along with the use of N
 <sub>org</sub>-fertilizer at the cost of N
 <sub>min</sub>-and P-fertilizers. These changes lead to some increases of the nutrient transformation flows in the catchment, which are slightly intensified for N-Min and P-MIN and weakened for DENIT by climate change.
