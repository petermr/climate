<p id="Par37">Discharge and nutrient inputs to the lagoons are quite diverse in terms of absolute values and climate sensitivity in the four study areas. High flow (Q
 <sub>10</sub>) shows the biggest range of variation among the analyzed variables in all study areas except 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic>, which indicates a high disagreement among climate models regarding the magnitude of storm events. Low flow (Q
 <sub>90</sub>) on the other hand shows the smallest variations, which does not implicate that it is less sensitive to climate, as we are looking at absolute values. The average annual discharge (Q
 <sub>av</sub>) is slightly higher than the discharge occurring during 50% of the time (Q
 <sub>50</sub>) in all four study areas, indicating higher significance of high flows than low flows for total flow. The ranges of the seasonal flows follow nearly the same regime as the corresponding discharges obtained during calibration, except for the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> catchment, where these variations under the observed climate are hardly noticeable, probably due to water flow regulation.
