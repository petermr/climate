<p id="Par36">Water and nutrients flows simulated with scenario climate are on average notably higher than under the observed climate in the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic>, 
 <italic>Tyligulski Liman</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchments, whereas they are lower in the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment, which corresponds well to differences in precipitation shown in the scenario climate evaluation discussed in “Climate Scenarios”.
