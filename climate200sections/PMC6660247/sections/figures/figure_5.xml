 <caption>
  <p>A heatmap showing the distribution of the average density of mouse location on the graph for liberals (left, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 47) and for conservatives (right, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 29) in the temperature condition. Participants whose ratings on the political orientation scale were below 0 were grouped as liberals and whose ratings on the political orientation scale were above 0 were grouped as conservatives. Warmer colors represent higher average density of mouse location.
