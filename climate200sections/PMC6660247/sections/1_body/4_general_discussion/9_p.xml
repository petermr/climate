First, the current study suggests that providing climate change evidence alone is likely to be insufficient since people may pay attention differently depending on their motivations. Second, the study suggests that we cannot use the same communication strategy for liberals and conservatives. For example, in Experiment 3, we found that drawing attention to more convincing evidence of climate change encouraged more liberals to act, but discouraged conservatives. Third, climate communication needs to align with ideological motivations to capture people’s attention. One approach is to frame climate change consistently with people’s values, such as framing mitigation efforts as promoting a warmer society and economic or technological development (
