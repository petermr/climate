<p>A more important finding in Experiment 2 was that the attentional difference between the rising phase and the flat phase was negatively correlated with the likelihood of signing the petition for liberals, but positively correlated for conservatives. One explanation is that liberals were equally sensitive to the increase in global temperature from 1930 to 1945 in the flat phase and from 1949 to 2017 in the rising phase, so focusing on both phases equally was associated with a higher likelihood of signing the petition. Another explanation is that liberals who were inherently more likely to sign the petition attended to the increases in temperature in both phases equally. For conservatives, however, the relationship was reversed. There were two possible interpretations of the correlation: those who attended more to the rising phase than the flat phase became more concerned with climate change and therefore were more likely to sign the petition; or, those who are more likely to sign a petition generally attend to the rising temperature as evidence for their action. Since the relationship was only correlational, we cannot identify the directionality. Nonetheless, the results from Experiment 2 suggest that attention guides climate actions in different ways for liberals and conservatives.</p>
