<p>Experiment 3 examined the causality between attention and climate action by drawing attention to the rising phase or the flat phase. We found that liberals were more likely to sign the petition or donate to an environmental organization when the rising phase (their motivationally consistent evidence) was highlighted. However, conservatives were more likely to sign or donate when the flat phase (their motivationally consistent evidence) was highlighted. These results suggest that drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence increases actions for both liberals and conservatives. Critically, the evidence is different for liberals and conservatives depending on their motivations. This also suggests that the same approach that works for liberals may not work for conservatives.</p>
