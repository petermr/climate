<p>The current study is significant in several ways. First, it provides an attentional mechanism to understand group polarization on climate change. Specifically, our results provide initial preliminary evidence for the motivated attention framework, suggesting an attentional divide between liberals and conservatives. Second, the current study has implications for theories of ideologically motivated reasoning, demonstrating their influence on basic perceptual processes. Third, we offer a free new tool, BubbleView, to track attention online, which is more cost-effective compared to a conventional eyetracker. Finally, our findings have implications for climate communication and the design of behavioral interventions to mobilize actions on climate change in different socio-political groups.</p>
