<p>In Experiment 2, we partially replicated the findings in Experiment 1 with a larger sample in the United States using the BubbleView technique to track attention online. The lack of a correlation between political orientation and attention on the rising phase in Experiment 2 could be driven by the fact that the flat phase was indeed less flat than that in Experiment 1. Since the global temperature graph contained both land and ocean data, there was a slight increase from 1930 to 1945. This increase may have made the flat phase and the rising phase more similar, therefore diminishing any attentional bias to the rising phase.</p>
