<p>The scientific evidence for climate change has been unequivocal (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014</xref>). In fact, 97% of actively publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are causing global warming (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cook et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, some people still remain skeptical about climate change despite the scientific consensus (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Weber and Stern, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hornsey et al., 2016</xref>). Within the United States, public views on climate change tend to polarize along party lines (
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">McCright and Dunlap, 2011</xref>). According to a recent Gallup Poll, 86% of democrats vs. 42% of republicans agree most scientists believe global warming is occurring; 4% of democrats vs. 69% of republicans think the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated; 89% of democrats vs. 35% of republicans believe global warming is caused by human activities; and 91% of democrats vs. 33% of republicans worry about global warming (
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brenan and Saad, 2018</xref>). This partisan divide has not only endured, but widened over time. A poll from Pew Research Center shows that in 2006, 79% of democrats vs. 59% of republicans said there is solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer, but in 2017, 92% of democrats vs. 52% of republicans said so (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Pew Research Center, 2017</xref>). There is also a growing divide in policy priorities: in 1994, 66% of democrats vs. 58% of republicans said stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, but in 2017, 77% of democrats vs. 36% of republicans said so (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Pew Research Center, 2017</xref>); in 2008, 47% of democrats vs. 15% of republicans said climate change is a top priority for the president and congress, but in 2018, 68% of democrats vs. 18% of republicans said so (
