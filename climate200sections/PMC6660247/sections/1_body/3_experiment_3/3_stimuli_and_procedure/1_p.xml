<p>Given the slight increase in temperature from 1930 to 1945 on the land and ocean graph in Experiment 2 may diminish any attentional bias to the rising phase, the stimulus used in the current experiment was the same global temperature graph used in Experiment 1, generated from estimates based on land data only

To manipulate attention, we highlighted the rising phase from 1950 to 2017 in red in the “rising red” condition (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), or highlighted the flat phase from 1880 to 1949 in red in the “flat red” condition (

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), or did not highlight the curve in the control condition (
 <italic>N</italic> = 89, 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In the rising red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.10 (60 liberals and 26 conservatives). In the flat red condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.23 (42 liberals and 25 conservatives). Attention was again tracked using BubbleView as in Experiment 2. After viewing the graph, participants were asked whether they were willing to sign a climate-related petition and whether they were willing to donate to an environmental organization, as in Experiment 2.
