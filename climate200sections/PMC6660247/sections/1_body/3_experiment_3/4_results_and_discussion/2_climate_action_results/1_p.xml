<p>We first conducted log linear analyses on petition signing in the three-way contingency table. We found a significant three-way interaction among condition (rising vs. flat), political orientation (liberals vs. conservatives), and signing (yes vs. no) [
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(4) = 13.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01]. This interaction suggests that more liberals than conservatives signed the petition when the rising phase was highlighted, but not when the flat phase was highlighted. To probe this interaction further, we conducted separate chi-square tests for the rising red condition and the flat red condition. Liberals were more likely to sign the petition than conservatives when the rising phase was highlighted (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 8.80, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). When the flat phase was highlighted, there was no significant difference between liberals and conservatives (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.42) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that liberals were more likely to sign the petition when the rising phase was highlighted than when the flat phase was highlighted.
