<p>For willingness to donate, we again found a significant three-way interaction [
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(4) = 20.00, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001]. Moreover, liberals were more willing to donate than conservatives when the rising phase was highlighted (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 13.03, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference between liberals and conservatives when the flat phase was highlighted (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.53, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.47). This again suggests that liberals were more willing to donate when the rising phase was highlighted than when the flat phase was highlighted.
