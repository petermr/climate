 <italic>G</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(4) = 12.37, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02]. However, we did not find a difference in the willingness to donate between liberals and conservatives in the temperature condition (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.32) or in the neutral condition (

 <sup>2</sup> = 2.65, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.10) (
