<p>This experiment aimed to replicate the attentional results from Experiment 1 using the BubbleView technique. To measure attention, we calculated the number of mouse locations in each AOI (defined below). Since there was no time limit for participants to view the graph, we used the proportional number of mouse location, which was calculated as the number of mouse locations in each AOI divided by the total number of mouse locations on the graph.</p>
