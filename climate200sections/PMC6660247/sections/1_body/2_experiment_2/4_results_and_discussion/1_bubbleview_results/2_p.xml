<p>Similar to Experiment 1, we defined two AOIs on the temperature curve, one on the flat phase from 1880 to 1948 (subtending 8.3째 of visual angle in width, 274 pixels, and 3.6째 in height, 120 pixels), another on the rising phase from 1949 to 2017 (subtending 7.7째 of visual angle in width, 254 pixels, and 5.2째 in height, 170 pixels). We adjusted the AOIs from Experiment 1 because this graph was slightly different from the graph in Experiment 1, as it contained both land and ocean data, whereas the one in Experiment 1 contained only land data. This means that there was a small peak of global temperature around 1945 in the current graph, whereas the curve in Experiment 1 was relatively flat before 1980. For this reason, we tried to divide the curve into two halves (with the year 1949 being the mid-point), and the second half of the temperature curve was defined as the rising phase, which was steeper than the first half of the curve defined as the flat phase.</p>
