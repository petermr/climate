<p>We first examined the relationship between political orientation and attention. This time, we did not find a correlation between political orientation and the proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase in the temperature condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(85) = 0.07, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.49] or in the neutral condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(88) = −0.03, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.81]. This did not replicate the numerical trend in Experiment 1. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, same as in Experiment 1, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
 <italic>r</italic>(45) = 0.12, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.44] or conservatism [
 <italic>r</italic>(27) = 0.09, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.64]. In the neutral condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
 <italic>r</italic>(30) = −0.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.58] or conservatism [
 <italic>r</italic>(37) = 0.20, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22].
