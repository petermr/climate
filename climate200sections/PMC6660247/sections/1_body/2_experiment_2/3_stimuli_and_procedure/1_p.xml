<p>The stimulus in this experiment was a graph showing annual global temperature, rather than temperature change as in the previous experiment. This was to ease the estimation of global temperature, as estimating average temperature change may be more difficult than estimating average temperature. Specifically, the graph showed the global annual mean surface air temperature in Celsius (°C) from 1880 to 2017 (

The graph subtended 23.4° of visual angle in width (783 pixels) and 13.6° in height (450 pixels), assuming that participants were seated 50 cm from a computer monitor with a resolution of 1920 pixels × 1080 pixels.
