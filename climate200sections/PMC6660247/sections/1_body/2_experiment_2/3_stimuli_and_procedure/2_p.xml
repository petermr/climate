<p>As in the previous experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the temperature condition (
 <italic>N</italic> = 87) or the neutral condition (
 <italic>N</italic> = 90). To measure participants’ attention, we used a novel online attention-tracking tool called BubbleView (adapted from 
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). The entire graph, including the x-axis and the y-axis, was covered by a black mask, and only a small circular area around the mouse was transparent where the participant could see the underlying graph (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Participants were asked to move their mouse to see the content of the graph. The black mask was the same size as the graph. The transparent circular area subtended 1.2° of visual angle (diameter = 40 pixels). We tracked participants’ mouse location as a proxy for visual attention.
