<p>Experiment 1 involved a sample of undergraduate students, therefore limiting the generalizability of the findings. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate Experiment 1 with a broader online sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using a novel attention-tracking technique called BubbleView. More importantly, this experiment aimed to examine how attentional biases were related to actions to mitigate climate change.</p>
