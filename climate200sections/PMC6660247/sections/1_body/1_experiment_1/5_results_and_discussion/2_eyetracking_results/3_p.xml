<p>To examine the overall relationship between participants’ political motivation and their visual attention on the graph, we correlated political orientation and the difference in proportional dwell time between the rising phase and the flat phase (rising − flat). There was no significant correlation between political orientation and the difference in proportional dwell time between the rising phase and the flat phase in the temperature condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(102) = −0.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.13] or the neutral condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(101) = −0.02, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.86]. However, relative to the neutral condition, in the temperature condition, more liberalism tended to be associated with greater proportional dwell time on the rising phase relative to the flat phase. These results point to a possibility that the more liberal the participants, the more attention they paid to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the temperature curve. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
 <italic>r</italic>(67) = −0.14, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.26] or conservatism [
 <italic>r</italic>(19) = 0.08, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.74]. In the neutral condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
 <italic>r</italic>(69) = −0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.70] or conservatism [
 <italic>r</italic>(19) = −0.32, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17].
