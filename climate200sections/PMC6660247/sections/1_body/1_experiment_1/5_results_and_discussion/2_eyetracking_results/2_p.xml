<p>From 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, it is evident that both liberals and conservatives looked more at the relatively flat phase of the curve from 1940 to 1980 and the rising phase of the curve from 1990 to 2013. We therefore defined two areas of interest (AOIs) on the curve: the flat phase (1940 to 1980, subtending 5.7째 of visual angle in width, 187 pixels, and 1.8째 in height, 59 pixels) which we interpret as weaker evidence of climate change, and the rising phase (1990 to 2013, subtending 3.4째 of visual angle in width, 112 pixels, and 3.0째 in height, 98 pixels) which we interpret as stronger evidence of climate change

 </xref>. To measure visual attention, we calculated dwell time in each AOI. Since participants spent different amounts of time on the graph, we calculated the proportional gaze dwell time for each participant, which was defined as the dwell time spent in each AOI divided by the total dwell time on the graph.
