<p>However, high model R
 <sup>2</sup> values, and the Gaussian nature and white noise of model residuals (indicating that residual errors were normally distributed and not auto-correlated), and cross validation against the yields of 2009 to 2013 showing low errors show that models were robust enough to answer the questions on mean precipitation and temperature change on crop yields (
