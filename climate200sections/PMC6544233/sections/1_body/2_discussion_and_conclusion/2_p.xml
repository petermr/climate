<p>Linear and extreme trends in weather were captured using linear and quadratic terms whereas correlations in warmth and moisture were captured using interaction terms. We did not explicitly model increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) impact as CO
 <sub>2</sub> is (1) highly correlated with time [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and further (2) several lines of investigations [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] show that the science of CO
 <sub>2</sub> effect on crop yields is not settled. Impacts from changes in other variables were beyond the scope of this study and should be considered in future studies.
