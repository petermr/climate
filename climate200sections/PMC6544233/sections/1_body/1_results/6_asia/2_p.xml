<p>The impact on crop yields on account of only temperature change (holding the precipitation variables at historical climatological values) is mapped in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s010">S9 Fig</xref>, whereas the impact due to only precipitation change (holding the temperature variables at historical climatological values) is mapped in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s011">S10 Fig</xref>. Temperature only effects are stronger in some areas such as Europe and East Asia whereas precipitation only effects are equally strong as in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Australia; these are not additive results and provide only an indication of the relative importance of temperature versus precipitation changes (
