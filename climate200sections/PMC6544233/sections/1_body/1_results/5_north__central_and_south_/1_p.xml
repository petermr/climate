<p>In North and South America the broad pattern shows benefits to crop yields from climate change especially in commercial crops such as maize, oil palm, soybean and sugarcane (

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and in the northern parts of the South American continent. Overall in the United States barley, rice and wheat yields reduced whereas maize, sorghum, soybean and sugarcane yields increased. In some countries such as in Canada, Panama, Honduras and Belize consumable food calories decreased whereas in Guatemala the change was insignificant (~0%). Recent climate change increased total consumable calories in the United States and Mexico. Major losses in consumable food calories have occurred in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay and Venezuela whereas in Brazil, Argentina Paraguay and Cuba consumable food calories overall increased.
