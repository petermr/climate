<p>Specifically when assessing the impact of recent climate change on crop production in countries where hunger is prevalent [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] we found the following: across the 53 countries with a hunger index of serious, alarming, or seriously alarming [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in 2008, we find that recent climate change had decreased consumable calories in 27 countries and increased in 26 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</xref>). Losses in consumable calories compared to total consumed food calories annually were particularly great in southern parts of the African continent, such as in Zimbabwe (-7.2%), Malawi (-6.5%), and Mozambique (-2.8%); in western Africa such as in Mali (-3.9%) and Ghana (-3.8%); and in Asia such as in India (-0.8%), and Nepal (-2.2%). Globally the average annual change is large for those consuming these ten crops (~ -1%) but not negligible across all consumable food calories as well (~ -0.5%). Although this metric does not address food access, nutrition, and other components of food security [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it suggests that climate change has increased the risk of food insecurity in many food insecure countries.
