<p>To show the effects of studying large countries as a single unit versus sub-national analysis consider the impact of climate change on rice in Cambodia and Malaysia. When analyzed at the country level, rice yield change of -0.03, and +0.15 tons/ha/year was found for Cambodia and Malaysia respectively. Analysis conducted at the subnational scale when summarized to the country level however shows -0.12, and -0.06 tons/ha/year rice yield change for Cambodia and Malaysia respectively. The difference is because when studied at subnational level we are able to isolate the impacts among regions. In the case of Cambodia in the rice bowl central plains region (like Kampong Thom district) and surrounding districts large rice yield losses occur. In the southern districts along the Gulf of Thailand (districts like Koh Kong) climate change benefitted rice yields, but the gains were not enough to overcome the losses elsewhere, leading to overall national level rice yield losses. Similar effect of geography is seen in Malaysia between the eastern (gains in rice yield) and western parts (losses in rice yields) of peninsular Malaysia on the two parts of the natural divide of the Titiwangsa Range; this subnational signal can only be captured through sub-national high-resolution analysis. Thus where possible higher resolution analysis will lead to more precise results.</p>
