<p>We do not report the Akaike or Bayesian Information criteria (AIC/BIC) here since these merely reinforce the goodness-of-fit results. Coefficient confidence intervals may be obtained by routine methods, and are not reported here for brevity, but are available. Low model R
 <sup>2</sup> that exists in some regions for some crops such as in Ryazan oblast for wheat should be borne in mind when interpreting results for those areas. Consistent with this approach, we restrict use of our models to climate conditions within the bounds of the observed weather conditions under which the models were constructed i.e. we conducted within-sample predictions and avoided out-of-sample predictions (see
