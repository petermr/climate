<p>A linear fit using observed weather variables (

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0217148.e001">Eq 1</xref> above) was thus constructed for each crop and political unit (the fitting method is QR decomposition). The model was next tested for significance at the p &lt; 0.05 levels (ANOVA F-statistics; NULL model is the average yield). If the linearly fitted model was significant it was then used to conduct predictions of yield for historical and current climate condition (which are in-sample predictions, as historical and current climate condition are within the range of observed weatherâ€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The difference in the predicted yield is the likely observed impact on crops yield due to mean climate change/climate trends at the level of the political unit (see more elaboration in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref> sections 2). Residuals were found to be normally distributed and not autocorrelated (

 <sup>2</sup> value in the linear regressions retained for this analysis from anywhere globally was in wheat (0.42 for the political unit of Ryazan oblast in the Central Federal region of the Russian Federation; the root-mean-squared error here was 0.4 tons/ha whereas the observed average yields are ~2.7 tons/ha/year). In all these cases, the goodness of fit test rejects the hypothesis of a lack of fit to the data (at the p = 0.05 level). Cross validation of model yield predictions against observations (2009 to 2013) showed low prediction errors (
