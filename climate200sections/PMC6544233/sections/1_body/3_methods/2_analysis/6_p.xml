<p>For computing production change we multiplied the climate change driven yield change with the 5-year average harvested areas (2004–2008); for computing percentage yield change with respect to recent yields we similarly computed a 5-year average yield (2004–2008) at each political unit. Country- and global-scale numbers are similarly all harvested area weighted. Finally we determined the change in food calories in a country as the sum of all of individual crop impacts out of the maximum of ten crops studied; most countries did not harvest all ten crops.
