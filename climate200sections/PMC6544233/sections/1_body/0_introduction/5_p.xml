<p>We constructed statistical models relating the observed yields to observed weather at each political unit from 1974 to 2008. (The period 2009 to 2013 was set aside for out-of-sample cross validation of model predicted crop yields against observations, at each political unit). We used a time-series analysis (Methods below) in which the influence of technology and management changes were accounted for in linear and quadratic time terms, whereas the normal and extreme temperature and precipitation variations and their interactions were represented with linear and quadratic terms consistent with previous studies [
