<p>To enable subnational analysis, we first constructed a database of harvested area, yield, weather, and climate statistics building on methods developed previously and accessing publicly available data from individual countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Crop statistics were compiled from 1974–2013 for ten crops across ~20,000 political units globally (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref>). These ten crops account for ~83% of global kilocalorie production from all croplands [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and represent several major crop group types. (Crops were not distinguished between varieties and managements—see section 1 of 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref> for more details). Weather and climate statistics (seasonal and annual, normal and extreme, precipitation and temperature) were calculated for each political unit using the CRU TS4.01 gridded global dataset ([
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref> for further information on how political unit level weather and climate information was constructed). 
 <italic>Historical climate</italic> is defined as the 30-year average weather prior to 1974. 
 <italic>Current climate</italic> is defined as the historical climate plus the addition of the linear trend of the weather for the 35 years ending in 2008, from the year 1974.
