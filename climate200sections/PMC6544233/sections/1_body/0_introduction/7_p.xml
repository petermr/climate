<p>The potential impact of climate change at each political unit is the difference in crop yield under current, and under historical climate conditions. This yield change information at the political unit was then converted to production changes using the average harvested area information over the 2003 to 2008 period at each political unit. Then all the political unit level climate-driven production changes in a country were summarized to give the country-level climate-driven production changes. Finally, we translated the country-level production changes to country-level consumable food calorie changes. In this process we accounted for harvested calories that returned as food calories after getting processed through animals as feed, through food processing, and calories directly consumed with little to no processing (
