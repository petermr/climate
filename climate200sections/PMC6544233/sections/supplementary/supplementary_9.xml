  <title>Weather information used for constructing the regression model for example crop and country cases (solid black filled circles).</title>
  <p>The models were then used for historical (open blue circles) and current (open red circles) climate conditions. Out-of-sample predictions do not occur as the historical and current conditions are bounded within the training weather conditions. (a) Maize (USA), (b) Rice (China), (c) Wheat (India), (d) Soybean (USA) (e) Maize (Mexico) and (f) Maize (China). Training weather data size is (N) X (35) and shown figures are for seasonal monthly conditions. Annual monthly conditions showed similar results (not shown).</p>
