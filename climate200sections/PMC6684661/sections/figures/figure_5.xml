  <p>Patterns of climatic niche shift for 
   <italic>Leucanthemum vulgare</italic> based on principal component analysis in different introduced regions (
   <bold>a</bold>) Southern America (
   <bold>b</bold>) Asia (
   <bold>c</bold>) Oceania (
   <bold>d</bold>) Australia (
   <bold>e</bold>) Northern America and (
   <bold>f</bold>) Africa, when compared with the native region (Europe). The first two axes of each PCA represent the density of species occurrences and the environmental space. Solid and dashed lines indicate 100% and 90% of all the available (analogous and non-analogous) environments. The blue colour represents the niche overlap between native and introduced region; the green colour a combination niche unfilling (in case of intersecting (analogous)) environments and abandonment (in case of non-intersecting (non analogous)) environments and the red colour a combination of niche expansion (in case of intersecting (analogous)) environments and pioneering (in case of non-intersecting (non- analogous)) environments. The red arrow indicates the change in the niche centroid between native and introduced range. The correlation circles represent the variable importance along the first two principle axes.
