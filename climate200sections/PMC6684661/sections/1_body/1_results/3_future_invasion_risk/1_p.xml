<p id="Par10">The results of the ensemble model based on the future climatic scenarios (RCPs 2.6–8.5) for two time periods (2050 and 2070) predicted that the overall habitat suitability for potential invasion by the species will increase in all the RCP’s. The increasing future habitat suitability ranges between 21,304,456 km
 <sup>2</sup> (with 4.33% increase as compared to current suitability) under RCP 8.5 2050 to 22,721,897 km
 <sup>2</sup> (with 11.27% increase) under RCP 4.5 2070

 <bold>)</bold>. Our analysis also showed that both the moderately and highly suitable area for the potential invasion of the species increases in all the future climatic scenarios. The moderately suitable area increases between 4,264,561 km
 <sup>2</sup> (7.91%) under RCP 6.0 2050 to 5,442,511 km
 <sup>2</sup> (37.72%) under RCP 4.5 2070, while as highly suitable area increases from 12,986,447 km
 <sup>2</sup> (2.29%) under RCP 8.5 2070 to 14,258,277 km

Under all the future RCP’s the regions showing future increase in moderately and highly suitable areas include southern Alaska, western and eastern Canada, western Peru, the southern part of Chile, central and north-eastern Norway and north-eastern, north-western and central parts of Russia (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In short, although the species showed both range expansion and contraction under the future climatic scenarios, however the range expansion predictions exceeded the range contraction predictions. As a result, the overall suitable area as well as the areas of moderate and high habitat suitability for the potential invasion of the species increases over time under the climate change.
