<p id="Par15">The evaluation of niche shift metrics based on the analogous (common) climatic space revealed several distinct patterns (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). (i) First, the species displayed niche expansion as exhibited by Southern America and Asia i.e. higher expansion value as compared to unfilling value (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In these regions, the species occupied wide range of climatic conditions as compared to that occupied in the native region (ii) Second, it unravelled niche unfilling as exhibited by Oceania, i.e. higher unfilling value as compared to expansion value (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>
 <bold>)</bold>. In this case, most of the climatic space occupied by the species in the native range remained unfilled in the introduced region, which indicates that its climatic niche in Oceania is almost a subset of the native European niche (iii) Third, it showed niche stability between the native and introduced climatic space as exhibited by Australia and Northern America, i.e. higher stability values and negligible expansion and unfilling values, (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In such a case, the climatic space occupied by the species in its native and introduced regions is almost similar but not identical. (iv) Fourth, the species also showed an almost completely dislocated climatic niche in case of Africa. In such a situation, the native and introduced climatic space occupied by the species showed clear separation, i.e. both expansion and unfilling values being comparatively higher with relatively lower stability (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>
