<p id="Par9">The potential distribution map created by the ensemble model, based on the current climatic conditions and occurrence records of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> showed that under the current climatic conditions, about 20,419,818 km
 <sup>2</sup> (14.04%) of the total area across the globe is suitable for potential invasion by
