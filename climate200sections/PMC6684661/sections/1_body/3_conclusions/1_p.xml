<p id="Par25">The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to model the current potential distribution and predicted the future distribution of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> under climate change. The study is also the first attempt to test the invasion niche dynamics downscaled to regional levels across the globe for this notorious invasive species. The current potential distribution of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> coincides well with the actual distribution records, thus indicating that species distribution modelling techniques are quite useful in predicting the suitable areas for the establishment and spread of potential invaders into new areas. The present study predicted an increase in suitable habitat for potential invasion of this species under climate change. Interestingly, the species shows differential niche shift dynamics ranging from niche conservatism (Australia and Northern America) to complete divergence in the niches occupied in the native and introduced regions (Asia, Africa, Oceania and Southern America). Research findings from the present study provide a way forward in the design of powerful predictive tools for the early detection of invasion risk-prone areas and develop appropriate management strategies to prevent the establishment and further spread of this invasive species across the globe.
