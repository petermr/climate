<p id="Par2">In an era of the climate change, biological invasions by invasive alien species represents one of the main anthropogenic drivers of global environmental change

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. Aided by anthropogenic activities, global climate change is predicted to accelerate the expansion of invasive species outside of their native biogeographical regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Although, there is a complex relationship between biological invasions and climate change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, the impact of changing climate is becoming increasingly evident in rapid shifting of species’ geographical distribution, changing lifecycle, population dynamics and life history traits of invasive species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Climatic factors are one of the main determinants of the overall distribution of invasive species due to their synergistic effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Recently, a number of studies have reported changing patterns in habitat suitability and range expansion of invasive species under the changing global climate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Simultaneously, a few studies also predicted a range contraction in the presently suitable habitat of invasive species under future climatic conditions
