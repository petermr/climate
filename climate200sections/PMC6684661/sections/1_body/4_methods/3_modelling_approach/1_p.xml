 </sup>. Although a lot of views had been put forth whether to use occurrence records from the native region, introduced regions or from the both the regions to predict the distribution of invasive species. The most commonly used framework is to use combined occurrence records from both the native and introduced regions simultaneously, owing to the inherent advantage that by using distribution data from the native range, it will make use of those occurrence records that are likely to be in equilibrium with the regional environment there in addition to including records from the introduced regions which may provide additional information about the expansion of the realized niche in the novel ranges

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, for the present study, we built the ensemble model based on the combined occurrence records from both the native and introduced regions of the species. We evaluated the predictive performance of each model using a repeated split sampling in which the models were calibrated with 70% of occurrence data and evaluated for the remaining 30%. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), true skills statistics (TSS) and Cohen’s KAPPA were used to estimate the performance of the model

 </sup>. AUC is a threshold independent measure of model evaluation that ranges from 0–1. An AUC value between 0.5 and 0.7 indicates poor model performance, 0.7–0.9 indicates good performance, and &gt;0.9 indicated high performance

 </sup>. While as both TSS and KAPPA are threshold dependent metrics of model evaluation and range from −1 to +1. Generally, the values of TSS and KAPPA below 0.40 indicates poor model performance, values ranging between 0.40 to 0.75 specifies good model performance and the values above 0.75 indicates excellent model performance

We generated a total of nine ensemble maps including: one current and eight future maps corresponding to four representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) for two time periods (i.e. 2050 and 2070). We constructed ensemble maps based on the median of three runs of all the selected models in which individual model had AUC value equal to or greater than 0.7 and TSS and Kappa values equal to or greater than 0.6 based on current climatic scenario
