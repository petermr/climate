<p id="Par34">We also calculated three niche shift metrics namely: niche unfilling (U), stability (S) and expansion (E) by adopting the Centroid, Overlap, Unfilling, Expansion (COUE) framework
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> to provide a more complete picture of niche dynamics. Since these niche dynamic categories reflect a case of ‘analogue’ niche space, which is defined as region of climate space shared between the native and invaded range of a particular invasive species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>, therefore in the present study, we calculated these niche shift metrics (i.e. expansion, stability and unfilling) by considering only the analogous (common) environmental conditions between the two regions being compared, using the function

 <italic>niche</italic>.
 <italic>dyn</italic>.
 <italic>index()</italic> implemented in the 
 <italic>ecospat</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>
 </sup> package. This approach was aimed to help distinguish between true niche shift (unfilling and expansion) and shift caused due to the availability of climates in only one of the two regions being compared (abandonment and pioneering)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Niche unfilling means the environmental conditions colonized by a species in its native range but not in the invaded range despite the presence of similar environmental conditions in the latter. Niche stability means the environmental conditions colonized by a species in both the native and invaded range, while as niche expansion means environmental conditions colonized by a species in its invaded range but not in its native range in spite of the presence of similar environmental conditions in the latter

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Further, in case of analogous (common) environments also, a particular climatic condition common in one of the regions may be less frequent in the other. These less frequent or marginal climatic conditions also matters when quantifying niche dynamics between two ranges
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, following the recommendations of Guisan 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> and Di cola 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>
 </sup>, the present study quantified the niche shift metrics by taking into account only 90% of the most common environments shared between the two regions after eliminating 10% of the marginal environments. Additionally, we also visualized the niche dynamics by taking into account all the available (analogous and non-analogous) climates between the two regions being compared in order to see if the species has shifted its niche into the non‐analogous climatic space as well.
