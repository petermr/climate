In addition, altitude was also included as one of the variables in the present study, as it has been found to be the main factor determining the distribution of the model invasive species selected for the present study

 </sup>. Thus, to begin with, we included 19 climatic variables and altitude as potential predictors in the present study. All 20 selected environmental variables had a spatial resolution of 2.5 minutes (approx. ~5 km resolution at the equator) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). Prior to modelling, we examined possible correlations between all the selected variables, since they often show high collinearity, resulting in poor model performance and misleading interpretations

 </sup>. We performed the Pearson’s correlation analysis and selected only those variables with correlation coefficient (r
 <sup>2</sup>) &lt; 0.75 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S12</xref>). A total of nine variables were finally retained: (i) Altitude (Alt) (ii) Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp − min temp)) (BIO2), (iii) Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (BIO8), (iv) Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (BIO10), (v) Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (BIO11), (vi) Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15), (vii) Precipitation of Driest Quarter (BIO17), (viii) Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) and (ix) BIO19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (BIO19) (Table
