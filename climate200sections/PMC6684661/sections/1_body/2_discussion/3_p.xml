<p id="Par19">Although species distribution models play a crucial role in predicting the potential distribution range of species under climate change, nevertheless such models are based on abiotic factors only. Biotic factors, such as inter- and intra-specific interactions, along with abiotic factors, also affect the potential range of species

Therefore, the future research challenge is to incorporate the biotic (like competition, propagule pressure and dispersal ability) and other (land use and land cover changes) factors in the distribution models in order to have a more refined understanding of the species distributions under changing climate
