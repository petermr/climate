<p id="Par18">Based on the results of our ensemble model, the predicted distributional maps showed that climate change would significantly influence the global distribution of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic>. The model suggested that there would be a gain in both the highly and moderately suitable habitats in both native and introduced regions. In particular, the areas adjacent to the current distribution range of the species are those that are under high risk of invasion. Moreover, the range of the species is expected to increase further under anthropogenic influence and climate warming. Therefore, the scientific community including the policy makers, land resource managers and other stakeholders in these High-Risk regions need to develop efficient management strategies in order to prevent the introduction, and if that fails, then to control the further spread of this invasive species. Although, our model predicts a steady increase in the potential future distribution range, however extensive shifts in suitable areas were observed only in the case of RCP 8.5 for 2070 under which the highly suitable area shows a shift towards north-western parts of Europe. Our results are in agreement with recent studies that have reported a range expansion for other invasive species under climate change
