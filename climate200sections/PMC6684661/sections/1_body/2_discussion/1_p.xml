<p id="Par17">The present study, for the first time at a global scale, modelled the current and future distribution of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> using an ensemble modelling approach. Under the current climatic conditions, the model predicted suitable habitats for invasion of this species in the southern part of Alaska, the eastern and south-western parts of Canada, parts of Mexico, the eastern part of United States of America and coastal parts of Columbia and Ecuador; the southern parts of Chile and the south-eastern part of Argentina in Southern America; almost the entire western part of Europe; the southern part of South Africa, central part of Ethiopia and Kenya and northern part of Tanzania in Africa; parts of western Himalaya in India, Pakistan and Nepal, north-western and southern parts of China and Japan in Asia and southern part of Australia and almost entire New Zealand in Australasia. The model predictions are in consonance with the current global distribution records that the species presently occurs, as either naturalized and/or invasive, and in all the continents except Antarctica

 </sup>. The suitable habitat predicted by our ensemble model is wider than the present distribution of the species. This can be attributed to the fact that our model included only the abiotic factors, i.e. climatic variables. Although, three factors are known to govern the distribution of species namely: abiotic factors (A), biotic factors (B) and movement (M) – so-called “BAM diagram”

 </sup>. However, such data on the biotic factors (e.g. species interactions, dispersal abilities and propagule pressure) are not readily available and their inclusion increases the complexity in modelling technique

 </sup>. Moreover, climate is considered as the prime factor affecting species distributions at the continental and global scales as is true for the present study. Nevertheless, at the local scale, factors like substrate and biotic interactions typically become more important
