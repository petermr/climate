<p id="Par22">While calculating the niche shift metrics in terms of analogous (intersecting) climates, the present study for the first time reported the invasion niche dynamics for 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> across the globe. Our results, when down-scaled to the regional level, suggested that the species showed niche conservatism (niche stability) in case of Australia and Northern America as indicated by the higher stability values of 0.93 and 0.92, respectively and lower unfilling and expansion values (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results suggest that this invasive species occupies climatic niches similar to those of its native range in these two introduced regions and such a similarity in the climatic space between the regions of origin and destination is considered to be critical factor for successful invasion in the non-native range

 </sup>. In contrast, the species shifted its niche to a greater extent in Asia, Africa, Oceania and Southern America. Interestingly, these results provide evidence that 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> can simultaneously occupy climatic niches distinct from its native range when introduced into a new area, thereby supporting the hypothesis that same species can undergo differential invasion niche dynamics in an introduced regions
