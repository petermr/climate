 <caption> Phenology and areas of theÂ coastal freshwater ( dark green), intermediate ( light green), brackish ( light purple), and saline ( dark purple) marshes in Louisiana from 1984 to 2014. The three key phenological parameters estimated are peak NDVI (Panel a), peak NDVI day (Panel b), and growing season length (bracketing days that had NDVI greater than 90% of peak NDVI; Panel c). The marsh areas are estimated in 1988, 1997, 2001, 2007, and 2013 (Panel d). </caption>
