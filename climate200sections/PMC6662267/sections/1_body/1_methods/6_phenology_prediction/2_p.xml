<p>Linear models describing the correlations between the marsh phenology and the climatic variables are built on the historical data and used to predict the marsh phenology in the future (until 2050). The future sea‐level and air temperature in the study area are estimated using linear models based on the sea‐level data from the NOAA Grand Isle Station, and the air temperature data from the NWS New Orleans Airport Station, both dating back to the 1940s (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">A1</xref>a, b). The slope of the sea‐level increase is 9 mm/year (

 <sub>2</sub> concentrations are from two carbon cycle models (i.e., the Bern model, or BERN, and the Integrated Science Assessment Model, or ISAM) and under different emission scenarios (i.e., A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2, A1p, A2p, B1p, B2p, IS92a, and IS92a/SAR; Figure
