<p>We acquire records of the atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, air temperature, Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), sea‐level, and salinity of the study area from stations of different US Federal and State agencies. The annual mean sea‐level data are from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) station # 8761724 Grand Isle, Louisiana, USA (
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">Tides and Currents</xref>). The annual mean sea‐level are calculated from the monthly means. The atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> records are from the NOAA Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Network Niwot Ridge Station, Colorado, USA (Earth System Research Laboratory). The National Weather Service (NWS) #12916 New Orleans Airport Station, Louisiana, USA, is the source for the precipitation and temperature data (

The correlations between the marsh phenology and marsh area with the climatic and environmental factors are analyzed using the pairwise Pearson's correlation analysis.
