<p>Global warming has a general effect of promoting plant growth that is manifested in increasing the growing season NDVI and lengthening the active growth season, especially in the middle and high latitudes (Myneni, Keeling, Tucker, Asrar, &amp; Nemani,

This result might be expected because the ambient temperatures in Louisiana (at latitudes around 30ºN) are already close to the optimum conditions for the marsh growth.
