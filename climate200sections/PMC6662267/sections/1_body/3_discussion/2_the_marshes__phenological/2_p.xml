<p>The correlations between the growing season length and the atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration may be the result of the stimulation of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration on photosynthesis in marsh plants (Cherry, McKee, &amp; Grace, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Rasse, Peresta, &amp; Drake, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). This is the first study we know of that reports a positive correlation between atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration and coastal marshes' growing season length, which reflects a broad pattern of ecosystem change due to a changing climate (Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The various responses among marsh systems are likely to reflect the different physiological characteristics of the marsh plants. The intermediate and brackish marshes have a high percentage of C3 plants, whereas saline marshes are mostly C4 plants. Elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> promotes the plant growth of C3 marsh species, for example, 
 <italic>Schoenoplectus americanus</italic>,
 <italic> Scirpus maritimus</italic>,
 <italic> Scirpus olneyi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Puccinellia maritima</italic>, but does not enhance, or even impairs, the plant growth of C4 species, for example, 
 <italic>Distichlis spicata</italic>,
 <italic> Spartina alterniflora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Spartina patens</italic> (Arp, Drake, Pockman, Curtis, &amp; Whigham, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Cherry et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Drake, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Erickson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Rasse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). This is because the increased atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> stimulates photosynthesis of C3 plants, but not the photosynthesis of C4 plants that is nearly saturated under ambient conditions as C4 plants concentrate CO
 <sub>2</sub> at the site with their primary CO
 <sub>2</sub>‐fixing enzyme. Moreover, the elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> may even inhibit the plant growth of C4 species by reducing their stomatal conductance, transpiration, and ion uptake (Ghannoum, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Rozema et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). Yet, the freshwater marshes, which have the highest percentage of C3 plants among the different marsh systems, demonstrate no response to higher CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels in our study. One possible explanation is that the high nutrient loading in freshwater marshes—freshwater marshes are closest to the surface runoff—favors species that are unresponsive to elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Langley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
