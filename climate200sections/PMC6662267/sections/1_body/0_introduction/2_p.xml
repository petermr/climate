<p>Coastal marsh carbon is an important component of the global carbon budget (Duarte, Losada, Hendriks, Mazarrasa, &amp; Marbà, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Coastal marshes have high primary production, efficiently trap suspended organic carbon when flooded, and undergo slow carbon decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions (McLeod et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Nellemann &amp; Corcoran, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The amount of carbon stored per unit area in stable coastal marshes can be far greater than that of forests, and the carbon stored may remain for millennia, as compared to decades or centuries in forests (Nellemann &amp; Corcoran, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The marshes and their carbon stocks, however, are susceptible to the direct and indirect effects of climate change (Hinson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Nahlik &amp; Fennessy, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Depending on the marshes' vegetation composition, the current ambient conditions, and other environmental factors such as nutrients, the marsh plant growth, and the resulting primary production can be stimulated or hindered by temperature warming, sea‐level rise, and elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (Charles &amp; Dukes, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Erickson, Megonigal, Peresta, &amp; Drake, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Langley &amp; Megonigal, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Langley, Mozdzer, Shepard, Hagerty, &amp; Megonigal, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Morris, Sundareshwar, Nietch, Kjerfve, &amp; Cahoon, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The decomposition of marsh substrates and hence the carbon sequestration rate can be promoted or inhibited by saltwater intrusion and global warming, varying among different marsh systems and being controlled by concurrent stressors (Craft, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Wu, Huang, Biber, &amp; Bethel, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Given the complex and dynamic outcomes of the various factors, it is hard to predict how coastal marshes will respond to the simultaneous climatic stresses at a landscape scale. Yet, this is a key piece of information needed in order to assess ecosystem sustainability and to predict future changes.
