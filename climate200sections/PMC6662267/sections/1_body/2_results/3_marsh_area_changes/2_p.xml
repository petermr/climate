<p>The total marsh area in 2013 was about 80% of the total marsh area in 1988, and 16% of the marshes in 1988 turned into water by 2013 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In 1988, the freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes composed 28%, 10%, 33%, and 29% of  the marshes in the study area, respectively, and 35%, 13%, 26%, 26% in 2013. The areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were quite stable, and their increased percentage was mostly a result of the decrease of the total marsh area. The marsh loss mainly occurred in the brackish and saline marshes, contributing to most of the 16% change of marsh‐to‐water from 1988 to 2013. The decrease of the brackish and saline marshes' areas were significant over time (

 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). The area of the brackish marshes decreased for 52.9% (from 2,326 km
 <sup>2</sup> in 1988 to 1,541 km
 <sup>2</sup> in 2013), and the area of the saline marshes decreased for 17.9% (from 2,080 to 1,631 km
 <sup>2</sup>). The area of the brackish marshes was negatively correlated with sea‐level, CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, and temperature, and positively with precipitation (
