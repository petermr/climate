<p>In Section 
 <xref rid="ece35215-sec-0009" ref-type="sec">3.1</xref>, we find that the peak NDVI day of the saline marshes was significantly correlated with air temperature and that the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes was significantly correlated with atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in all cases). Based on these correlations, we use the phenological and environmental data from 1984 to 2014 to build models to predict the marshes' future phenology. The model for predicting the brackish marsh growing season length (day) is −171.0538 + 0.8606 × CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The model for predicting the intermediate marsh growing season length (day) is −139.3226 + 0.7169 × CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The model for predicting the saline marsh peak NDVI day (day of year) is −376.507 + 29.365 × Temperature.
