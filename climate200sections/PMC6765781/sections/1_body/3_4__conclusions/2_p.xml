<p>As a result of paucity of up to date data on outdoor workplace heat exposure, workplace climate change adaptation strategies and other relevant related health and safety issues, the assessment of impacts of climate change and how it affects workers in the tropical countries such as Africa is considered timely. This includes the need for current information on the effective management of climate change impacts. In addition, gender response to climate change impacts on the continent workforce will require the development of more evidence, where a high proportion of women now work in fast-paced outdoor industries that include agriculture, mining and construction. To strengthen the knowledge of climate change, workplace heat exposure and related workplace injury and to guide safety adaptation measures, there is a need for multidisciplinary research to help in the quantification and forecast of workers hazards exposure by occupation and location in these countries where the impact of climate change is more pronounced. Research areas proposed in the assessment of climate change impacts on outdoor workers productivity and occupational safety include:
