<p>Release and exposure to environmental chemicals due to increased heat is expected to increase through various routes. These include increased pesticide use, changes in transport pathways such as dust proliferation, increased chemical dispersal from storm runoff, and increases in chemical spills from floods and fires [

Several workers in trades or industries using or producing petroleum products (such as coal etc.), and those working in close proximity where the combustion of these products occur (such as traffic wardens, taxi/bus drivers, road maintenance etc.) are vulnerable to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure. However, their impact due to climate change are said to vary. In addition to this, the presence and exposure of legacy pollutants (persistent substances like DDT, dioxins, PCBs, mercury, etc.) that have accumulated in environmental reservoirs (such as surface soils, sediments, and forests), especially among workers in certain occupations (
