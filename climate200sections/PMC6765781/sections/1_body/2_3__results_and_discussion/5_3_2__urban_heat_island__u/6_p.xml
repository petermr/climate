<p>There is a strong relationship between the UHI effect and urban planning. This is due to the fact that the absence of trees and vegetation in urban areas affects the transpiration process. The implementation of proper vegetation in urban areas helps cool the surroundings, resulting in increased evapotranspiration and reducing the UHI effect. Other measures include the use of water bodies to reduce thermal load and decreasing the anthropogenic heat [
