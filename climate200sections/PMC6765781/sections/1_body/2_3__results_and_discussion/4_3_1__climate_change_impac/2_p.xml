<p>To understand the impacts caused by climate change, there is first the need to understand the phenomenon itself. The availability of manmade heat absorbing features such as concrete buildings, surface modification, pollution generated from automobiles etc. in urban areas has helped increase heat absorption during the day, and its gradual release back into the atmosphere at nighttime. This has had an impact on temperature differences between urban and rural areas, and sped up the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in urban areas [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is now a need for evidence-based studies on climate change adaptation and urban heat island effects in relation to outdoor workers. This can raise awareness of occupational health hazards in order to establish risk awareness and coping strategies among workers, managers, and other stakeholders [

While there is anecdotal evidence based on research carried out in other parts of the world regarding excessive heat exposure and its impact on workers’ health, safety, productivity and workplace environmental conditions and adaptation strategies, there is a paucity of similar data among outdoor workers in parts of sub-Saharan Africa; especially in a changing climate as perceived today [
