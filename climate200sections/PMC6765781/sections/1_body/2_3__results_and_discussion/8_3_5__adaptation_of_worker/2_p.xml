<p>The intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) affirmed that if the present climate change trend persists, by the middle of the century, high temperatures and humidity would probably compromise outdoor working. Thus, leading to lost work capacity and reduced labor productivity among vulnerable populations, such as that in sub-Saharan Africa, and will eventually cause economic loss. To avoid productivity and economic loss and social ramifications resulting from extreme heat exposure among outdoor workers, there is a need for employers to consider measures capable of protecting workers and their businesses through investment into appropriate climate change adaptation measures [

They include, working with light cloth, dousing themselves with water to regulate their internal body temperature, consumption of water, taking intermittent breaks etc., however, these techniques require further scientific measures aimed at complementing these tools, especially where it is insufficient for coping with extreme hot weather conditions.
