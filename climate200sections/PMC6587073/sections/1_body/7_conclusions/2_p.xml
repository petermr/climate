<p>The effect of rainfall and other meteorological variables were assessed on a wide range of infectious diseases in China. While diseases such as malaria and scrub typhus were found to have more consistent associations with rainfall, the associations with other infectious diseases such as dengue, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and HFMD have been less consistent. However, studies on rainfall and other meteorological factors have rarely examined other health impacts such as non-communicable diseases and injury. As typical rainfall distribution patterns vary regionally, the generalizability of each health outcomeâ€™s study conclusions may be limited. Yet, changing rainfall patterns and the occurrence of extreme weather events like flooding and drought will continue to impact the trends of infectious diseases and other health outcomes. It is critical to develop further knowledge on the regional effects of rainfall variability on health for regional and community planning.</p>
