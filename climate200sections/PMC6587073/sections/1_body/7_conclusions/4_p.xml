<p>Flooding is the extreme weather event that is highly relevant to China in terms of mortality, morbidity and economic loss. Existing understanding on the health impact of floods is mainly limited to certain regions and a few types of infectious diseases. Other outcomes should be considered, e.g. hepatitis A virus infection, malaria, injuries, mental health consequences (including anxiety and depression) and chronic disease complications. More attention should also be paid to the health impact of typhoon, especially in the context of rising sea level for the coastal cities. Projection studies for extreme weather events are also highly recommended.</p>
