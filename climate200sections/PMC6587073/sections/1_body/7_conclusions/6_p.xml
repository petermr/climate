<p>Based on the current gaps of knowledge in our review findings, future climate change and health research in China or urban communities of middle-income countries should pay special attention to the following: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Health studies with sea-level rise, rainfall or extreme weather events as the main exposures;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>More studies located outside of main municipalities and the Eastern and Southern China regions;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Research on the specific climate change-related health needs among special vulnerable populations in the urban areas in China, e.g. among urban migrant workers (percentage of urban employment rose from 28 to 52% between 1995 and 2015);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Studies focused on health outcomes such as comorbidities, mental health, allergy and injuries patterns; and</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>More long-term studies (at least over 10Â years) over the health impact of climate change, inclusive of potential acclimatization, are warranted.</p>
