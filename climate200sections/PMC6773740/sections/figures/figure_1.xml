  <p>. Distribution of climate regions, vegetated coastal ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) and organic carbon (C) storage in Australia. 
   <bold>a</bold> Climate regions used to classify vegetated coastal ecosystems and scale blue carbon storage across Australia. Climate regions for Australia were modified from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s “Koppen–Major Classess” climate classification for Australia based on temperature/humidity, vegetation and seasonal rainfall
   <sup>

   </sup>. The original climate classification scheme was comprised of six classes: Equatorial, Tropical, Subtropical, Desert, Grassland and Temperate, but the number of climate regions was reduced into five categories: Tropical (includes Equatorial), Subtropical, Arid (instead of Desert), Semi-arid (instead of Grassland) and Temperate.
