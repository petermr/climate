<p id="Par31">Substantial data gaps for blue carbon stocks and sequestration rates exists in parts of the country (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Most notably, there are limited data over much of northern Australia, where ecosystem extent is greatest for all three VCE. Stocks, sequestration rates, and losses of C are also poorly quantified in converted or modified systems and there are few studies of C sequestration capacity in restored ecosystems

 </sup>. The robustness of the global assessments presented here relies on a number of estimates, including the extent of Australian VCE, annual loss rates, degree and fate of soil C loss after disturbance, differences in the impact of different types of disturbances or management activities, and the type of C trading methodology used. Therefore, the potential C abatement and its economic value may vary across VCE, and with management and political scenarios.
