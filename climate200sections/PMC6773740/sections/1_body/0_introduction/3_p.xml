<p id="Par5">Here, we pioneer the estimation of C stocks in aboveground biomass and soils, as well as soil C sequestration rates, in VCE at the national level, and do so for the Australian continent, one of the major reservoirs of VCE in the planet. We estimate the potential for VCE conservation and restoration to mitigate GHG emissions in Australia and demonstrate, therefore, the potential of blue carbon strategies to support policies contributing to climate change mitigation at the national level.</p>
