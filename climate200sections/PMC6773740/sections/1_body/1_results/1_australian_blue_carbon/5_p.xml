 </sup>. The species richness, together with climatic and environmental drivers associated with variations in coastal geomorphology (i.e., temperature, rainfall, tides, sediments and nutrients) govern the structure and function of mangroves and tidal marshes, and thereby their C storage capacity, with relatively high plant productivity and biomass in tropical, subtropical and some temperate regions compared to arid regions
