<p id="Par17">Assuming a recovery of soil C sequestration after VCE rehabilitation, we estimate that the restoration of an area equivalent to 10% of historic losses of VCE extent in Australia (5730 km
 <sup>2</sup>) would enhance soil C sequestration by 1.15 ± 0.91 Tg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup> (mean ± SD; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), reducing annual emissions from land use change in Australia by 6–8%. This can also result in a benefit of US$ 11.5 ± 9.1 million per annum (assuming a conservative C trading price of US$10 t CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e
 <sup>−1</sup>, the approximate value paid in Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). The benefits of restoration vary among VCE and climate regions, averaging 1.4 ± 1.1 Mg CO
 <sub>2</sub> ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for tidal marsh (13–16 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup>), 4.6 ± 3.3 Mg CO
 <sub>2</sub> ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for mangroves (15–145 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup>), and 1.3 ± 1.2 Mg CO
 <sub>2</sub> ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for seagrass (10–18 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup>). These estimates are conservative since potential avoided GHG emissions from soil C following the restoration of historic losses of VCE extent were not accounted for, while the restoration of mangroves would also entail enhanced CO
 <sub>2</sub> sequestration in aboveground biomass.
