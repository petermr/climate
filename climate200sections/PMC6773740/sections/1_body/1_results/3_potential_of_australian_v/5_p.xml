<p id="Par19">Recent coastal development in Australia continues to result in a net decline in VCE extent, estimated at a minimum 0.03% year

 <sup>−1</sup>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, current decline in seagrass extent in Australia has not been estimated, and here we assume a loss of 0.1% year
 <sup>−1</sup> (i.e., 9300–12,800 ha year
 <sup>-1</sup>) largely resulting from dredging, water quality deterioration and shoreline modification, to estimate potential CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from habitat loss
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. This assumption is conservative relative to global estimates, which are one order of magnitude higher
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>, we estimate emissions of 2.1–3.1 Tg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup> as a result of current losses of Australian VCE (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), increasing emissions from land use change in Australia by 12–21% per annum. The loss of VCE would also result in a loss of future soil C sequestration of 13–19 Gg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, conservation actions resulting in avoided losses of VCE in Australia, falling outside business-as-usual scenarios, could result in avoided CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions and sustained C sequestration valued at 22–31 million US$ per annum (3000–4000 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for tidal marsh, 2000–22,000 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for mangroves, or 1500–3000 US$ ha year
 <sup>−1</sup> for seagrass).
