<p id="Par18">Targeting blue carbon hotspots for restoration can provide larger benefits per unit area. Mangroves, in particular those occupying tropical regions where there is potential for reversing large, historic losses in coastal wetland extent

 </sup>, are hotspots for C sequestration. For example, the restoration of an area equivalent to 10% of historic losses in tropical mangrove extent in Australia (1150 km

 <sup>−1</sup>, reducing annual emissions from land use change in Australia by 4–5%. It is therefore imperative to develop policies that preserve and restore VCE to mitigate GHG emissions in Australia, where recovery of historic losses offers a vast potential for C sequestration. Importantly, conservation and restoration of VCE also provide enhanced adaptation to climate change through coastal protection and regulation of flooding, as well as biodiversity and fisheries benefits
