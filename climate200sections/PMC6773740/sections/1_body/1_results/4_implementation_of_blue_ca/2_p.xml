<p id="Par21">Our results show that Australia is a hotspot for VCE holding large quantities of blue carbon storage equivalent to 5–11% of blue carbon soil stocks worldwide, despite losses amounting to 47–78% of tidal marsh and mangrove extents, and 20–26% of seagrass extent since European arrival. Therefore, Australia stands to benefit from developing blue carbon-focused climate change mitigation schemes. Restoration of historic losses of VCE together with enhanced conservation of threatened VCE could constitute a mechanism to mitigate Australian CO

The estimates reported here provide a pioneer demonstration of the approach required to deliver estimates that can be incorporated into national carbon accounting and underpinning the incorporation of robust blue carbon strategies within Nationally

The baseline map of blue carbon in Australia provides an essential underpinning to assess the impact of land use changes and climate change on blue carbon fluxes and stocks. The pioneer assessment at a national, and continental, level reported here provides a methodology beyond the use of Tier 1 approaches currently available in the IPCC Wetland Supplement
