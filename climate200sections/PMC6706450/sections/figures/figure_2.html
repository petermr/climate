 <caption> Flood return period curves for the historical period of 1980–2005 (black) and future period of 2070–2095 (blue: only effects of TC changes, red: compound effects of SLR and TCs) at selected coastal counties. a– c Representative counties in New England; d– f representative counties in mid Atlantic; g– i representative counties in southeast Atlantic; j– l representative counties in Gulf of Mexico. Empirical data points for the historical period are shown as black circles. Solid lines represent the best estimates of flood return periods. Shaded areas cover the very likely range estimates (i.e., 90% statistical confidence interval). Future projections are weighted average over the six climate models. Flood levels are relative to mean higher high water (MHHW, obtained from https://vdatum.noaa.gov). Source data are provided as a Source data file </caption>
