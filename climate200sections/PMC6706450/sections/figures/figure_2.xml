  <p>Flood return period curves for the historical period of 1980–2005 (black) and future period of 2070–2095 (blue: only effects of TC changes, red: compound effects of SLR and TCs) at selected coastal counties.

Solid lines represent the best estimates of flood return periods. Shaded areas cover the very likely range estimates (i.e., 90% statistical confidence interval). Future projections are weighted average over the six climate models. Flood levels are relative to mean higher high water (MHHW, obtained from
