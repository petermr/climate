 <caption> Projected changes in TC characteristics from the historical period of 1980–2005 to the future period of 2070–2095. a– d NCEP-based TC annual frequency (Fr), maximum wind speed (V max), radius of maximum wind speed (R max), and the intensity size index V max 2R max for the historical period. e– h Projected changes (weighted average over climate models) in Fr, V max, R max, and V max 2R max for the future period. A basin wide weighting factor (which is the average of weighting factors for storm tides over all coastal counties) is used for each climate model. Values represent 90th percentile of TCs (with V max &gt; 40 knot) passing through 2 × 2 degrees boxes. Source data are provided as a Source data file </caption>
