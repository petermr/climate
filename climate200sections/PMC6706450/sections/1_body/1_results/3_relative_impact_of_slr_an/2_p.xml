<p id="Par15">Our projections show that TC climatology change has a minimal impact on 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> at high latitudes whereas its impact on 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> at lower latitudes is as significant as SLR. In the New England region, SLR is projected to contribute between 82.2 and 99.7% to 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub>, whereas TC climatology change contributes only between 0.3 and 17.8% (for counties bordering the Gulf of Maine, 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year, TC</sub> &lt; 3%). The contribution of SLR to 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> is between 67.1 and 96.1% in mid-Atlantic and between 44.6 and 89.8% in southeast Atlantic. It is reduced to 35–80.1% for the Gulf of Mexico region. In 41% of coastal counties in the Gulf of Mexico, the TC climatology change is projected to be the main cause of increase in the future 100-year flood level (i.e., contribution of TC climatology change &gt;50%). This spatial trend of relative effects of SLR and TC climatology change on the flood level also exists for other return periods, as shown in Fig.
