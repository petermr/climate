 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year, SLR</sub> and 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year, TC</sub>) to 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub>. The effect of SLR is largest in the mid-Atlantic and New England regions, and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, consistent with the projected SLR patterns

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. We find that SLR results in an increase in 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> of 1.07 m (35% increase in the average 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub>) in the Gulf of Mexico (averaged over all counties in this region), 1.08 m (74%) in the southwest Atlantic, 1.38 m (165%) in the mid-Atlantic, and 1.58 m (239%) in New England. The effect of TC climatology change varies along the coastlines in a contrary way. The TC climatology change alone increases 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> by about 0.93 m (31% increase in the average 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub>) in the Gulf of Mexico, 0.44 m (30%) in the southeast Atlantic, 0.29 m (35%) in the mid-Atlantic, and only 0.1 m (15%) in New England. The largest-projected TC induced change in the 100-year flood level is about 1.5 m for several coastal counties in Mississippi and Louisiana. Our projections show a 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year, TC</sub> of about 0.16 m for the New York county, NY, which is consistent with a previous study
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, where results from four climate models showed that the influence of TC climatology change on New York City’s 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> is between −0.2m and 0.75 m.
