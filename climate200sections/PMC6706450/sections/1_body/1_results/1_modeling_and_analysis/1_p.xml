We run the model to generate 5018 synthetic TCs for the observed climate of the historical period between 1980 and 2005, based on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis

We simulate 5018 synthetic TCs for each model for the future period. We also generate another 5018 TCs for each model for the historical period.
