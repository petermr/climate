 <sub>100 year</sub>. Our projections from six climate models (based on CMIP5 RCP 8.5 scenario) for the New York county show an increase of between 1.36 and 1.90 m with a weighted average increase of 1.53 m. The subtle difference between the range of projections is mainly because the previous study was based on a different synthetic TC dataset, its projections were not bias corrected, and a different computational mesh was used in the hydrodynamic model. The previous study was also based on a deterministic SLR of 1 m, whereas the present study is based on a probabilistic projection of SLR.
