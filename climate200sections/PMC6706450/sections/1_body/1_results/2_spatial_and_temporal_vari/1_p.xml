<p id="Par9">As examples, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the return period curves for representative coastal counties in each region. The future return period curves take into account the impacts of SLR and TC climatology change, which is the weighted average over the six climate models (with weighting factors shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Results indicate that the flood level for a given return period substantially increases by the end of 21st century, due to SLR as well as TC climatology change. The very likely estimates (5th–95th percentiles; i.e., 90% statistical confidence interval) of flood levels with a long return period cover a wide range, indicating a large statistical uncertainty in such events. The uncertainties are smaller for flood levels with a higher probability of occurrence, e.g., the 100-year flood return level. We retain the focus of the remainder of this paper on the 100-year flood level.
