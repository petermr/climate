 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> shows the future return periods of the historical NCEP-based 100-year flood level, which are estimated to be between 5 and 30 years (16.4 years, averaged over all counties) for the coastal counties in the Gulf of Mexico and between 1 and 29 years (average 8.3 years) in the southeast Atlantic. In the New England and mid-Atlantic regions, the historical
