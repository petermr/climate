 </sup>. Yet effects of TC climatology change on flood hazards at the basin and global scales have not been investigated, nor have the compound effect of SLR and TC climatology change and its spatial variation. Understanding the basin to global scale variation of TC flood hazards and their future evolution is critical, if we are to identify the current and future degree of flood risk in different regions and to prioritize adaptation and mitigation investments.
