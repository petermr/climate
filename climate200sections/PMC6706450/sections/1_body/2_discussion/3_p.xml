<p id="Par21">Current flood risk mapping from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not accounted for the effects of climate change. We found that under the effects of SLR and TC climatology change, the historical 100-year flood level would occur annually in the New England and mid-Atlantic regions and every 1â€“30 years in the southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions in the late 21st century. Thus, we strongly suggest that future flood mapping and flood mitigation planning account for the effects of SLR and TC climatology change.</p>
