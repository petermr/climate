<p id="Par19">TC flood risks are evolving along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, owing to SLR and TC climatology change in the western North Atlantic Ocean basin. The rate at which sea level is changing varies from place to place

 </sup>). The impact of TC climatology change in the basin could spatially vary too although, to our best knowledge, this was not investigated prior to the present study. Here, for the first time, we showed that TC climatology change would substantially increase flood return levels, with the highest and lowest impacts in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Maine regions, respectively. We found that the effect of late 21st century TC climatology change on 100-year flood levels exceeds the effect of SLR for over 40% counties along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
