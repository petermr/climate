<p id="Par25">We use ADCIRC, originally developed by refs. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, to simulate storm tides. We adopt the basin scale computational mesh developed by ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. The mesh covers the western North Atlantic Ocean, extending between latitudes 8°N and 46°N and longitudes 98°W and 60°W. Details of the hydrodynamic model parameters can be found in ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. The simulation is driven by wind, pressure, and tidal forcing. We use the analytical model of ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> to calculate the (1 min) storm wind at the gradient level based on the maximum wind speed and radius of maximum wind. For use in the ADCIRC model, we convert the gradient wind to the surface level (10 m above the sea surface) with a velocity reduction factor of 0.85 and an empirical expression of inflow angles
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. We add to the storm wind the surface environmental wind estimated as a fraction (0.55, rotated counterclockwise by 20
 <sup>o</sup>) of the storm translation velocity, to account for the asymmetry of the wind field
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, we adjust the 1 min wind to a 10 min average with a reduction factor of 0.893
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. We use the parametric model of ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> to calculate the radial profile of pressure given the pressure deficit. The water level at the open boundaries is specified by eight major tidal constituents K1, K2, M2, N2, O1, P1, Q1, and S2. Tidal data, including amplitudes and phases, are obtained from the global model of ocean tides TPXO8–ATLAS with a 1/30° resolution

 </sup>. The timing of astronomical tide is matched to that of the synthetic TCs.
