 </sup> to generate large numbers of synthetic storms for different climates. This model uses both thermodynamic and kinematic statistics derived from observations or a climate model to produce synthetic TCs. The model first randomly seeds the basin with weak, warm–core vortices. The motion of vortices is then determined by a beta–and–advection model which uses synthetic environmental wind time series. The wind time series have the monthly means, variances, and covariances calculated from daily data from observations or a climate model and obey a geostrophic turbulence power–law distribution of kinetic energy. The pressure deficit, maximum wind speed, and radius of maximum wind of each storm is calculated using the deterministic coupled air–sea model, Coupled Hurricane Intensity Prediction System (CHIPS)
