<p id="Par30">We note that projections from climate models may be biased. Therefore, we bias correct the GCM-projected storm tide climatology before combining it with RSL distributions to estimate flood hazards. Similar to refs.

 </sup>, we bias correct the storm frequency and storm tide CDF for each GCM by comparing the GCM-estimated frequencies and CDFs for the historical period with NCEP-based estimates and assuming that the biases calculated for the historical period can be employed to bias correct future projections. In particular, we bias correct the storm tide CDF through quantileâ€“quantile mapping. For each return period (with an increment step of 1 year), we calculated the bias by subtracting the NCEP-based return level from the climate-model-estimated return level for the historical period and subtracted this bias from the climate-model-projected return level for the future period.
