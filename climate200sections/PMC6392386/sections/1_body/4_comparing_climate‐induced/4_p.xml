<p>For example, western montane and boreal woodpecker species such as the American Three‐toed Woodpecker, Red‐naped Sapsucker, Williamson's Sapsucker, and White‐headed Woodpecker are predicted to lose climatically suitable habitat based on the bioclimatic niche models (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Climate–forest models associated with these woodpeckers’ habitats project shifts in species distribution and composition (McKenney, Pedlar, Lawrance, Campbell, &amp; Hutchinson, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). In other words, climate–woodpecker models indicate a range loss due to climate change, but climate–forest models report a mixed response of the underlying habitat. Assuming tree species of this region (associated with woodpeckers’ suitable habitat) track their climate niches (i.e., the climatically suitable range of woodpeckers is more closely associated with a congruent shift in vegetation), forest composition change projections are mixed leading to the potential for habitat persistence. Lodgepole pine (
 <italic>Pinus contorta</italic>), black spruce (
 <italic>Picea mariana</italic>), and aspen geographic ranges will likely decline (Coops &amp; Waring, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2011a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011b</xref>; McKenney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Rehfeldt, Ferguson, &amp; Crookston, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), ponderosa pine 
 <italic>(Pinus ponderosa)</italic> range projections show mixed results (Coops &amp; Waring, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011b</xref>; McKenney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), and Douglas fir (
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>) range is predicted to increase (Coops &amp; Waring, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011b</xref>; McKenney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). However, tree species will exhibit some level of delayed climate niche tracking (McKenney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) because tree species migration will likely not keep pace with projected climate change (L. R. Iverson, Schwartz, &amp; Prasad, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This will result in a lag effect between changing climatically suitable geographic range and subsequent woodpecker species colonization because contemporary vegetation patterns will not perfectly track climatic shifts. This will increase the likelihood of the persistence of suitable habitat or refugia (Beever et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) through the 21st century, which are undetectable with bioclimatic niche models (Wiens &amp; Bachelet, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
