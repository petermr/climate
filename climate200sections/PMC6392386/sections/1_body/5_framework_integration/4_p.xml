 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), plant functional types (outputs of DGVMs) still do not adequately account for future habitat distributions of woodpeckers (i.e., the type of climate–forest model (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) is important). This is because plant functional groupings may be of a scale too course to model woodpecker responses to forest characteristics. For example, Bancroft, Lawler, and Schumaker (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) found no impact of climate change on Red‐cockaded Woodpecker habitat loss. They modeled climate as direct (i.e., precipitation effects on reproduction) and indirect (i.e., plant functional group responses to temperature and precipitation) effect. However, the resilience of the Red‐cockaded Woodpecker population is related to the structural components of a stand (tree density and size class distributions) and ground cover composition (James, Hess, Kicklighter, &amp; Thum, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), which are indistinguishable at the scale of plant functional groups. Therefore, even with the persistence of the needle‐leaved evergreen biome or long‐leaf pine successional stages within this region (Costanza, Terando, McKerrow, &amp; Collazo, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), finer scale niche attributes are important (Schiegg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) and should be included in model integration.
