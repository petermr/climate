<p>Development of forest management strategies aimed at increasing or preserving wildlife species in a changing climate requires modeling efforts that include the coupled response of vegetation 
 <italic>and</italic> wildlife to climate change. We suggested woodpeckers as indicator species of forest resiliency and biodiversity in an integrated forestâ€“wildlife modeling framework, because they are ecologically constrained by forest structure, composition, and processes, which also affect a diversity of other organisms. Based on our comparison of predicted and observed woodpecker responses to climate change, we propose a framework for integration of climate, woodpecker, and forest modeling (Figure
