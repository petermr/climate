<p>Among the models reviewed, the model of Langham et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) is the most comprehensive in relation to the greatest number of species and spatial extents modeled. The authors predict distributional changes to 2100 and compare these to species distributions in 2000 using bioclimatic modeling under a range of climate change scenarios for North American avifauna, including 20 North American woodpecker species. They used 13 combinations of emissions scenarios and general circulation models over three time periods to produce 39 different climate futures. All woodpeckersâ€™ contemporary breeding and winter geographic ranges are predicted to contract due to climate change (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and 13 of the 20 woodpecker species evaluated are predicted to be climate endangered or threatened due to loss of breeding and/or wintering range by the end of the century (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Some of the range losses will be mitigated by climatically suitable range expansions. This results in an overall 53% and 23% of the woodpecker species breeding and nonbreeding ranges to exhibit net contractions by 2080, respectively (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Overall, all woodpecker species will lose climatically suitable habitat by the end of the century, and even with net gains, a majority are labeled as climate threatened or endangered based on climatic range changes (Supporting information Table
