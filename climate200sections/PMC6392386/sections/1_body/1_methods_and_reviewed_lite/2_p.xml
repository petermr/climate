<p>We conducted a systematic literature review of the observed and predicted responses to climate change of 22 North American woodpecker species. We refer to woodpecker response models as any of the following: species distribution, occupancy, abundance, and demographic models. Search terms using Google Scholar and Web of Science included “avian cavity nesters climate change,” “woodpeckers climate change,” “birds climate change,” and “birds breeding climate change.” The search spanned all literature through June 2018. We included all papers that modeled the effects of climate change on woodpecker responses. Models that based predictions on alternative analyses to evaluated datasets (Distler, Schuetz, Velásquez‐Tibatá, &amp; Langham,
