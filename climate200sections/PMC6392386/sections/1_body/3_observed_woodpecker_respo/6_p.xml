<p>Studies that have specifically evaluated woodpeckers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) have found geographic and elevational shifts (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), and most woodpecker range extents are either expanding or not changing with the exception of the contracting Ladder‐backed Woodpecker (
 <italic>Dryobates scalaris</italic>), Williamson's Sapsucker, and Red‐headed Woodpecker (Bateman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Stephens et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) found that 13 of the 20 woodpecker species included in their comprehensive avifauna study have been advantaged by climate change across most of the evaluated states; that is, the probability of occurrence was positively associated with climatic trends and was independent of abundance trends (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). It has been hypothesized that as yearly mean temperatures rise, breeding and nonbreeding ranges in North America will likely continue to track climatically suitable habitat north and only be constrained by terrestrial habitat features (La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Though over the last four decades, avifauna have not always tracked their climatic niches; there has been a lag effect in some North American species (La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In some instances, species that have colonized human‐dominated systems do not fully track their climatic niche shifts (Tingley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>).
