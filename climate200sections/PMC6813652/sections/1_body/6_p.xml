<p>The effects of snowpack decline and plant root on soil microbial communities and nitrogen mineralization were studied 
 <italic>in situ</italic> for 29 months across an elevation gradient in northern hardwood forest, in the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, USA.

The potential soil N mineralization rates were related to saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal abundance, while soil nitrification rates were related to the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. The results suggest that a declining winter snowpack and its effect on plant roots each impact the diversity and abundance of soil bacteria and fungi that can interact to determine rates of soil N cycling in northern forest ecosystems.
