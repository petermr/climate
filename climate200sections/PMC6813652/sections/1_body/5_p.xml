<p>Microbial communities in bulk and rhizosphere soil of 
 <italic>Ranunculus glacialis</italic> along a high Alpine altitudinal gradient (2,600–3,400 m a.s.l.) in the Central Alps in Austria were studied in detail by 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01429" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Praeg et al.</ext-link> No overall altitudinal pattern of microbial community structure and diversity was detected. The biggest differences in the abundance of specific biomarker taxa were observed for the mid-altitudinal transition zone (3,000–3,100 m a.s.l.) which corresponds with the summer snow line. Prokaryotes were mainly influenced by soil temperature and pH. Fungal communities were also related to altitude and showed often unique occurrence at the highest elevations in the nival zone. The rhizosphere of 
 <italic>R. glacialis</italic> significantly influenced the community composition of prokaryotes but not of fungi.
