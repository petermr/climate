<p>The fungal class Archaeorhizomycetes is widespread in soil environments, associated with plant roots and rhizosphere, and has putative saprotrophic activity. However, the absence of systematic sampling of fungal communities along environmental gradients makes the ecological role and the trophic status of Archaeorhizomycetes in terrestrial ecosystems still elusive.

The metagenomic DNA data from the soils of 103 sites in the Swiss Alps along an elevation gradient spanning &gt;2,500 m (374â€“3,210 m a.s.l.) demonstrated that the variation in the fungal abundance was explained by a range of climatic and edaphic factors. Co-abundance patterns between Archaeorhizomycetes and other saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal taxa were recognized. The potential role of Archaeorhizomycetes in biological rock weathering, because of high correlation to soil redox parameters, is also discussed.
