These summits belong to the three Swiss target regions of the worldwide long-term monitoring network “Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine environments (GLORIA),” which was initiated to gain knowledge on the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems. The 10 summits range from the lower alpine to the nival zone and span an elevation gradient of 850 m [2,360–3,212 m above sea level (a.s.l.)]. The study demonstrated highly diverse microbial communities in the summit soils as a result of highly variable local environmental conditions, such as soil properties, parent material, climatic variables, and vegetation. The strong influence of environmental changes on bacterial communities indicates that they will be strongly affected by future climate change (associated temperature increase and upwards migration of vegetation).
