<p>Climate change is one of the largest challenges facing our planet. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that by the end of the twenty-first century, under RCP8.5 scenario, the global average surface temperature will increase in the range of 2.6–4.8°C. This climate change will produce an immediate rising of soil temperature, which, along with other alterations, such as drought and precipitation pattern, increasing carbon dioxide levels or nitrogen deposition, will affect the structure, diversity and abundance of soil microbial communities.</p>
