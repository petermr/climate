<p id="Par24">To calculate present and future little auk energy requirements according to each migratory strategy (current migration, residency or transarctic migration), we used Niche Mapper (see
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>).This mechanistic model contains a microclimate module, which provides environmental data for the immediate surroundings of the animal, and an animal module, which integrates outputs from the microclimate model with animal morphological, behavioral and physiological characteristics. Those modules are used to solve heat balance equations between the animal’s body and its surroundings, and estimate the metabolic rate required for the animal to remain in a thermal steady-state. Niche Mapper simulations were performed for the little auks population breeding in Franz Josef Land (Russian Federation), because both winter residency and transarctic migration are plausible for birds from this locality (see Results below) and their current wintering areas are known (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Niche Mapper has been previously used to model little auk wintering energetics
