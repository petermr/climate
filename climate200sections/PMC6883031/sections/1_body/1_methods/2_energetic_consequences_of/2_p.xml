<p id="Par25">We modelled current and future little auk energy requirements during their migratory journey (in September and March) and wintering phase (October to February) according to three scenarios: (1) Current migration: At their current wintering areas in the North Atlantic (defined as the centroid of kernel distribution available on the SEATRACK website, see also Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). (2) Transarctic migration: At potential future wintering locations in the North Pacific, corresponding to the closer area predicted as suitable for the four climatic models using ‘biomod2’ (see previous section and results) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). (3) Residency: Within 250 km of their potential future breeding site in Franz Josef Land, in areas predicted as suitable using ‘biomod2’ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For each strategy, the migratory flyway used in September was considered as the straight line between the colony and the wintering location, avoiding flights &gt;100 consecutive km across land (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the spring, the Arctic Basin is predicted to remain iced until much later in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, and it is unclear whether little auks would engage in a direct flight to the Atlantic, or will perform a loop migration, whereby the return journey will use polynyas peripheral to the Arctic Basin as stop-over sites. Both case were studied, by considering a direct flyway (the same as in September) or a peripheral one, the latter corresponding to a path minimizing the time spend flying above areas dense in sea-ice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For the current and residency strategies, the spring return journey is supposed to be the same as in September.
