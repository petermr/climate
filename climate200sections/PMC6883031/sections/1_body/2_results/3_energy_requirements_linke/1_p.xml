<p id="Par30">Little auks breeding in Franz Josef Land currently winter predominantly in the Barents Sea and off Jan Mayen (North Atlantic). In these areas, their current daily energy requirements are predicted to increase throughout the non-breeding period (September to March), from 449 +/− 57 to 760 +/− 6 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> off Jan Mayen and from 732 +/− 2 to 772 +/− 8 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> in the Barents Sea. Rising winter energy requirements has already been observed in the Atlantic for little auks overwintering off Newfoundland, and is explained by the decreasing air temperatures

 </sup>. Across the winter period, birds were predicted to require a total of 138 +/− 3 MJ off Jan Mayen and 161 +/− 1 MJ in the Barents Sea. According to the four climatic models considered, winter energy requirements linked to the little auks’ current migratory strategy are predicted to decrease slightly in the future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.). Their future total energy requirements may therefore decrease to 119 +/− 4 MJ off Jan Mayen and to 158 +/− 0.1 MJ in the Barents Sea. In comparison, predicted daily requirements of little auks wintering in the North Pacific are considerably lower, and range, on average, from 267 +/− 2 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> in September to 323 +/− 6 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> or 322 +/− 5.8 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> in March according to the migratory flyway considered (direct or peripheral, respectively). Indeed, favorable thermal conditions encountered along the peripheral route offset the enhanced flight costs due to the greater travelling distance. Overall wintering costs (accounting for flights across the arctic basin) are 59 +/− 0.7 MJ for this transarctic strategy according to the four climatic models. Sea surface and air temperature are main drivers of little auk winter energy requirements

 </sup>, and since those temperatures are higher in the North Pacific in winter, they explain lower overall energy requirements for little auks engaging in transarctic migration, despite higher flight costs. Little auks from Franz Josef Land are predicted to become year-round residents only under the ACCESS 1.3 and HadGEM2-ES climatic models: Under these conditions, their energy requirements are predicted to range between 737 +/− 2 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> in September and 761 +/− 2 kJ.day
 <sup>−1</sup> in March. Little auk overall winter energy requirements for this residency strategy are then estimated to 159 +/− 0.3 MJ, similar to those of birds remaining in the Barents Sea in the future.
