<p id="Par11">This species was chosen because the little auk is the most numerous seabird in the North Atlantic Arctic (population estimated at 40–80 million individuals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>), with significant impact on terrestrial and marine trophic networks
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> and an acknowledged sensitivity to environmental changes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. On the basis of its morphological and ecophysiological traits, we short-listed the little auk as a likely candidate for future year-round residency in the high Arctic, and/or for new transarctic migration (see Methods), from the North Atlantic into the Pacific.
