 <caption> Current (black arrows) and future (grey arrows) migratory strategies of little auks breeding in Franz Josef Land (white triangle). In March, the return journey from Pacific could be made directly (grey arrows) or by by a peripheral flyway (grey dashed arrows). Their current known wintering areas ( http://www.seapop.no/en/seatrack/) are in blue. Graticules are set at a 15° interval and the map is projected as North Pole Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area.
