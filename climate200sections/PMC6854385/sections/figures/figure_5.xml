  <p>The interaction effects (i.e., changes in the marginal effect on the hazard from the full Cox model) of the different factors relative to the within‐year arrival date (a = spring progression/thermal sum; b = between‐year mean arrival effects; c = female age [experienced female effect], and d = year trend from 1993 to 2017) when all other factors are held at their mean values. The 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axes show the exponentiated coefficient for that factor for different arrival dates, with all of these effects becoming less influential for late‐arriving birds. The horizontal dashed line at 1.0 is the point where the factor has no effect on the probability of egg laying (because the exponentiated coefficient has a multiplicative effect on the hazard). The black line shows the median, the dark shading the 50% CIs, and the light shading the 95% CIs from 1,000 bootstrap simulations per arrival date (using the “simPH” package in R)
