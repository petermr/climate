  <p>The relationship between within‐year arrival relative to the year‐specific mean arrival date (= 0 on 
   <italic>x</italic>‐axis) and: (a) the length of the arrival‐breeding interval (days after arrival), and (b) the variance in the arrival‐breeding interval (days; mean [dashed line] and 95% CIs [gray shading]). Each point in the left panel represents an individual arrival‐breeding event and is “jittered” so that all raw data points can be seen in the plot. The gray shading in the right panel shows the 95% credible intervals of the predicted variance (days) in the timing of the first egg being laid relative to the arrival date (i.e., the arrival‐breeding interval) for the same individual data shown with the points in the left panel (Appendix
