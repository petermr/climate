<p>We analyzed the probability of starting egg laying on any given day after arrival (i.e., the arrival‐breeding interval) for 734 breeding attempts from a total of 549 females for which we knew arrival date, the timing of egg laying and had all covariate information we were interested in. This provided us with a total of 12,078 interval‐days, where we could model the instantaneous probability that a given female would lay her first egg at time 
 <italic>t</italic> given that she had not already begun egg laying. Because females were repeated within the dataset, we used an extension to the Cox model that included female ID as a random effect (a so‐called “frailty model”; Therneau &amp; Grambsch, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Without this random effect, the Schoenfeld's residuals indicated some violation of the proportional hazards assumption. We examined the following covariates: (a) the individual arrival date centered relative to that year's mean arrival, (b) the mean arrival date for each year to account for year effects influencing arrival and subsequent impacts on the arrival‐breeding interval, (c) the progression of spring (daily thermal sum) for each date during the study period, (d) year as a linear change during the study period, as a measure of progressive climate change independent of other measures included in the model, and (e) the age of the female (first‐year breeder or older). We also modeled all two‐way interactions that included the individual arrival date to examine how the relative influence of the different covariates changed relative to the timing of arrival in each year. This was because the arrival‐breeding interval showed a dramatic reduction in variation with later arrival dates (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), suggesting strong covariate interactions were associated with this variable. In our study area, there are strong associations between habitat and demography (Arlt, Forslund, Jeppsson, &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Low, Arlt, Eggers, &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Parquet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>); however, these were unlikely to influence the arrival‐breeding interval because they are associated with changes in field‐layer height later in the season (i.e., during chick rearing). Thus, we did not include a territory quality variable in our analyses; subsequent confirmatory analyses supported this decision and showed that territory field‐layer height had no relationship with the arrival‐breeding interval (all 
 <italic>p</italic>‐values &gt;0.5). Analyses were done in R (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) using the “coxme” and “simPH” packages (Gandrud,
