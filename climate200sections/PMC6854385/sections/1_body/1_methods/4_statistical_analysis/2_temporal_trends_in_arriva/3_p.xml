<p>To check whether any trends we observed were the result of sampling biases within our study population (since we only have arrival‐breeding data for a fraction of our study birds, and we have more arrival data in some years than others), we compared changes in the timing of breeding from our sample (with matched arrival dates) to changes in the timing of breeding for all known‐aged birds in our study area that we had breeding data for (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,368). The yearly trend from a regression model that accounted for female age and female identity did not differ between the two groups (“year” regression coefficient −0.205 ± 0.03; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 734 vs. −0.208 ± 0.03; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,368), strongly suggesting our arrival‐breeding data did not suffer from sampling bias in this regard.
