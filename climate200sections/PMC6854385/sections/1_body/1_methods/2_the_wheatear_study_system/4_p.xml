<p>The earliest individuals began egg laying in early May. While some nests were found during egg laying/incubation, the majority (~80%) were found after hatching and, therefore, the timing of breeding was estimated based on chick age (comparing morphological development to photos of known hatch‐date nestlings of different ages), brood/clutch size (assuming egg laying of one egg per day on consecutive days), and 13 ± 1 days of incubation, with incubation beginning when the penultimate egg was laid (Öberg et al.,

We only include data from first (initial) breeding attempts and calculated the arrival‐breeding time interval as the number of days between arrival and the estimated start of egg laying. Most birds in the study area attempt breeding only once per season (~93%); however, it is possible that some birds could have eluded observation during a failed first attempt and their recorded breeding date is from a second attempt. It is also possible that some very late‐arriving birds were considered as “unknown” or as “second attempts” and incorrectly excluded from the data. While this would bias the data in those specific cases (e.g., into having a later arrival or longer prelaying interval than actually occurred), these cases unlikely total &gt;1% of all observations considering the search effort and the clear behavioral signs of breeding. Thus, we consider our results robust to these sources of observation error. Based on plumage characteristics, we distinguished two age categories in breeding adults, 1 year old (first‐year breeder) or older (Pärt,
