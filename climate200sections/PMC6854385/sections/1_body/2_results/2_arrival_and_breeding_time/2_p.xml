<p>Females arrived during ~45 days between early April and mid‐May during the years of the study. Arrival dates were strongly positively correlated with egg‐laying dates and negatively correlated with variance in breeding dates and the length of the arrival‐breeding interval. Early‐arriving birds had much longer arrival‐breeding intervals than late‐arriving birds (mean of ~25 vs. 5 days, respectively, with the interval becoming 0.5 days shorter for each 1‐day delay in arrival; coefficients from GLMM: intercept = 14.8 ± 0.49, arrival date slope = −0.51 ± 0.02 days) and demonstrated much more flexibility in their arrival‐breeding intervals (variance of ~25 vs. 4 days, respectively; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Between 1993 and 2017 arrival dates advanced slightly more than egg‐laying dates (6 vs. 5 days), meaning that the raw arrival‐breeding interval increased by ~1 day over this period (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35716-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, if changes in the arrival dates were also included in the model, then the yearly trend in the arrival‐breeding interval showed a decrease in 2.3 days from 1993 to 2017 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35716-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This indicates that a bird arriving on the same calendar date in early years of the study had a longer arrival‐breeding interval compared to one arriving in later years.
