<p>To address this issue, we study a long‐distance migratory bird, the northern wheatear (
 <italic>Oenanthe oenanthe</italic>) that breeds in Sweden and overwinters in Africa (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We investigate whether recent advances in its timing of breeding (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) were achieved by adjustment of arrival time, and/or the length of the arrival‐breeding interval. We also examine variation in the length of the arrival‐breeding interval using a Cox proportional hazards model to determine the factors related to the probability of initiating egg laying after arrival. We examine these factors not only to gain insights into recent phenological changes in this species, but also to gain a general understanding of the factors that influence or constrain the timing of breeding in migratory birds. Thus, we ask the following questions: (a) How are recent changes in the patterns of breeding time in the northern wheatear (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) reflected in changes in its arrival times and the arrival‐breeding interval; (b) What factors are related to the probability of beginning egg laying after arrival (e.g., we expect female age, the timing of arrival and the degree of spring progression to influence the arrival‐breeding interval); and (c) How does the relative importance of these factors change throughout the breeding season? Like many seasonally breeding organisms the wheatear displays a seasonal decline in fitness related to breeding time (Öberg, Pärt, Arlt, Laugen, &amp; Low, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Pärt, Knape, Low, Öberg, &amp; Arlt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>); thus, we would expect factors determining the length of the arrival‐breeding interval to vary in their importance depending on the timing of arrival.
