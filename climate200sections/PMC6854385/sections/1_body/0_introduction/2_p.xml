<p>For seasonally breeding species, the effect of climate change often shows as earlier breeding in association with warmer spring temperatures (Chambers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). However, the degree of advancement in phenology may differ between trophic levels, leading to reduced breeding synchrony within some food webs. In birds, this may result in a phenological change between their timing of reproduction and the peak of food availability (Both, Bouwhuis, Lessells, &amp; Visser, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Both et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Thackeray, Sparks, &amp; Frederiksen, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), potentially affecting reproductive output and population growth rates (Both et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Møller, Rubolini, &amp; Lehikoinen, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; but see Reed, Jenouvrier, &amp; Visser, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Kristensen, Johansson, Ripa, &amp; Jonzén, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). This issue is seen as especially important for migratory species that not only need to time their breeding to match lower‐trophic‐level phenology, but also their arrival at the breeding ground (Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
