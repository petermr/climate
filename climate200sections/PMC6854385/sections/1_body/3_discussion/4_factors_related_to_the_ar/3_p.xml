<p>Interestingly, the importance of these effects on the probability of egg laying was conditional on the timing of within‐season arrival (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Variation in year effects (including between‐year mean arrival), spring progression and female age all influenced the arrival‐breeding interval of early arrivers, with this effect declining during the season and having no effect on late arrivers. The drivers behind this pattern are likely the relative changes in resource availability, which relate to the fitness impacts of delaying breeding (Drent &amp; Daan, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>). Here, early‐arriving birds will face relatively poor local conditions and so will be more influenced in their decision to breed by their own condition, local territory quality, and the uncertainty about fitness trade‐offs of initiating versus delaying breeding. Compare this with a late‐arriving bird, where conditions are generally good because spring has progressed to beyond a certain threshold and there is much more certainty that breeding needs to be initiated sooner rather than later. Thus, they all begin breeding soon after arrival, with very little between‐individual variation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These patterns suggest that breeding time for the majority of the population is not constrained by arrival date, and that the arrival‐breeding interval still provides the flexibility they need to time their breeding to suit local conditions.
