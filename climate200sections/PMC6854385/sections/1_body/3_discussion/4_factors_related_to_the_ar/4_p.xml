<p>We show that both arrival and breeding time are somewhat flexible and that breeding time is generally not constrained by arrival, at least for early‐ to midarriving birds. Still, adjustments of breeding time seem constrained by local seasonally limited availability of essential resources (i.e., there are both pre‐ and postarrival factors acting on selection for the timing of breeding in this population). Although arrival and breeding in this population now occur at a relatively later stage of spring progression because of climate change, it is not clear that this has resulted in some sort of “mismatch” between breeding and the peak food supply, nor that the birds are somehow constrained in their breeding time because they are arriving at the breeding ground too late. It seems likely for early‐ to midarriving birds that their timing of arrival and breeding are largely independent, and instead depend on local conditions after arrival to determine their breeding time. There is an advantage for birds to arrive earlier now compared to 20 years ago because of the relative advantages of securing the best territories (i.e., nest‐site competition) in combination with reduced costs of arriving early as spring temperatures have warmed. For late‐arriving birds, however, the timing of breeding appears to be influenced by arrival constraints. Hence, impacts of climate change on arrival dates and local conditions are expected to vary for different parts of the population, with potential negative impacts associated with these factors likely to differ for early‐ versus late‐arriving birds. Thus, population responses of migratory birds to climate change may be unpredictable and arise from multiple factors differentially operating on subsections of the population.</p>
