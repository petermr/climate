<p>Predicting whether migratory birds will alter their arrival and egg‐laying dates in the context of climate change is challenging, because they face a suite of trade‐offs relating to early‐ and late‐season processes such as: adult and offspring survival, competition for breeding sites, and resource acquisition for egg‐laying and subsequent offspring feeding (Johansson &amp; Jonzén, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Thus, the historical phenology of a population and its phenological responses to climate change will depend on the relative timing and change of these processes (Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Previous findings from this population questioned whether earlier breeding but declining demographic rates in this population result from “mismatched” phenologies or a general deterioration in environmental quality (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, without individual arrival data this picture is incomplete, as it is unclear whether some (or all) of the change in the timing of breeding relative to spring progression is related to constraints associated with arrival (e.g., Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Here, we investigated both arrival time and breeding time and their interrelation. This showed that yearly trends of breeding time, and the factors related to variation in the arrival‐breeding interval, were largely independent of arrival time for early‐ to midarriving birds in our study population. Instead, and in line with Arlt and Pärt (
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), adjustments of breeding time appear most likely constrained by seasonally limited availability of resources.
