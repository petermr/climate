<p>The first is that the cues the birds use along their migration route to determine their arrival time were largely in synchrony with seasonal changes for initiating egg laying at the breeding ground. Thus, birds arrived earlier during the course of the study and there was no requirement for birds to further adjust their breeding time, and hence arrival‐breeding interval, beyond what was normal for this population (i.e., the arrival adjustment “pulled” the breeding time along with it). One potential problem with this explanation is that the arrival and breeding dates have not been keeping up with advances in spring progression at the breeding ground (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), meaning that birds are arriving progressively later relative to the advancement of spring, but then taking almost the same amount of time before they decide to breed. Assuming that spring progression influences the timing of initiating breeding, this suggests there are other factors influencing breeding decisions.
