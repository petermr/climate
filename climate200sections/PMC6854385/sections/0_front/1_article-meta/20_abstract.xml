 <p>We examine the interrelationship between the timing of arrival and breeding in a migratory bird. The arrival‚Äêbreeding interval was related to the timing of arrival, the age of the bird, and the degree of spring progression and year. The timing of breeding appears to not be constrained by arrival date, but rather dependent on various local conditions.
