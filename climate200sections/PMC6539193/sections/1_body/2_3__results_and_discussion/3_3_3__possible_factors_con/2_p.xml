<p>Sunshine duration is an important variable, which can be a proxy for SR (solar radiation) [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01504" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Reductions in SD have been attributed to the increasing atmosphere aerosols from industrial pollution, which reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the ground [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01504" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, sunshine duration was closely related to changes in DTR [

Consequently, a decreasing SD would reduce the downward shortwave radiation during the day, thereby limiting the increases in

 </inline-formula> was the primary factor behind the significant positive association between SD and SDTR. The SD was highly correlated with SDTR in each season. The magnitude of correlation coefficients follows the order of winter (0.78) &gt; autumn (0.77) &gt; spring (0.74) &gt; summer (0.61). In addition, looking at the trends in SD changes over the same time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01504-f006">Figure 6</xref>), we found that the areas of decreasing SD correspond to areas where SDTR had also decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01504-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Based on the strong positive correlation and similar spatial patterns, we concluded that the decreases in SD were largely contributed to the decreases in SDTR.
