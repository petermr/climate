In addition, crop growth is affected by soil and air temperature. Temperature is one of the most important factors to keep plants alive and functional [

Seed germination, seedling emergence, developmental and growth, root extension and growth, and fruit maturation are sensitive to air temperature and soil temperature changes. Furthermore, they are sensitive to the dynamic relation of air and soil temperatures.
