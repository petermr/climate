<p>Soil temperatures may play important roles in agriculture production and human activity. Global warming has caused changes in soil temperatures. IPCC5 (Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reported that the global mean trends in ground temperature significantly increased for all datasets over multi-decadal periods [

Zhang et al. found that the soil temperature in Canada in the 20th century experienced significant warming, with the complex response process of soil temperature to air temperature and precipitation changes having an obvious impact on climate change [

A published paper reported that the annual surface soil temperature increased by 1.90 °C (national level) during 1961–2011, with the highest changes occurring in the northern area and during winter. The warming occurred to a depth of up to 3.20 m [
