<p>However, the warming trends of surface soil temperatures and its change characteristics, not only in China but elsewhere, have not been categorized in great detail over prolonged intervals. The diurnal change in surface soil temperature, which is similar to the change in air temperature, is directly affected by various above-ground environmental conditions. Furthermore, most soil processes, including the decomposition and formation of soil organic matter, are sensitive to diurnal temperature changes [
