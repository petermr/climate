<p>Of the 205 populations in our data sets, 34% were no longer present when resurveyed. The most parsimonious extinction model based on largest Î”BIC included only the main effects of population size, time between surveys, and elevation. Each of these factors was significant in the final model for predicting extinction probability of populations (
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The general linear model suggested that small populations had a greater probability of extinction than large populations, and extinction probability was near zero for populations with &gt;100 individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210378.g001">Fig 1</xref>, left). Extinction probability increased as the time between surveys increased (
