<p>We used logistic regression ([
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], glm in R stats package) to construct models to estimate extinction probability. The response variable was population status at the most recent visit (a binomial response, either extinct or extant) and predictor variables were size of the population at the first survey, number of years between the first and last survey, and elevation (m) of the population. Population size was log-transformed in the logistic regression model to meet assumptions of normality. We used a model selection routine comparing Bayes Information Criterion [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] values among models with all combinations of predictor main effects and interactions, and we choose the most parsimonious model based on the smallest BIC value. All analyses were performed in R 3.6.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).
