<p>To estimate the number of populations of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> recorded as still extant in the land management databases, GeoBOB and NRIS-Terra, for California and Oregon, we applied our selected final model for predicting extinction probability to the 2896 populations recorded in those databases based on their size, years since the last survey, and elevation. Predicting average population survival is theoretically possible using regression coefficients, however prediction uncertainty in logistic regression is not derived from coefficient uncertainty like in linear regression, and instead can be empirically derived. Logistic regression prediction uncertainty, which assumes a binomial distribution, is inaccurately wide, even if predictions are converted to log-odds ratios, when theoretically estimated using coefficient uncertainty, which assumes a Gaussian distribution (see our R script for example). To empirically estimate uncertainty around predicted survival of all populations, we bootstrapped the coefficients in our chosen model by randomly selecting 205 populations from our model building data set, with replacement, and estimating the logistic regression coefficients at each iteration [

For each bootstrapped set of coefficients, we calculated the extinction probability of each population in the land management databases, subtracted from one and summed those probabilities to estimate the number of extant populations, and repeated this bootstrap process 10,000 times to estimate 95% confidence limits (i.e., prediction uncertainty). We performed this analysis in R 3.6.0 [
