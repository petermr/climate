 <italic>Cypripedium fasciculatum</italic> (clustered ladies slipper) occurs in scattered population centers in western North America in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. In California and Oregon, this taxon occurs predominantly in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains and Sierra Nevada Mountains. The United States Forest Service (USFS) considers it to be a Sensitive Species and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lists it as a Bureau Sensitive Species (designations that indicate population viability is of concern and the species may need special management consideration), and it is considered globally secure because of its widespread geographic range and abundance in some states [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In California and Oregon the species is most often found on north facing slopes in mixed coniferous forests of &gt;60% canopy closure [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic> is the most common associated tree, but other frequently noted forest components include 
 <italic>Abies concolor</italic>, 
 <italic>Cornus nuttallii</italic>, 
 <italic>Pinus lambertiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Calocedrus decurrens</italic>. Clustered lady's slipper is known to occur in California and Oregon at elevations from about 180 to nearly 2000 m. The species has a complex life-history and depends on specific mycorrhizal fungi [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which may affect its seed germination and growth. Mycorrhizal fungi may determine where and in which specific habitats this orchid can grow and how it responds to disturbance, but little information is available on the fungi, their requirements, associated tree species, and their function in forest ecosystems [
