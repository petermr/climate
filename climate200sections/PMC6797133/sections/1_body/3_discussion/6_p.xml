<p>Seed dispersal can lead to the recruitment of new populations on the landscape. Some or all of the extinctions we observed and modeled could be offset but the establishment of new wild populations. However, data from a portion of the geographic area of our study system suggests that the rate of establishment of new populations is approximately 0.000018 populations/ha/yr, while extinction is 2.8 times that rate (0.00005 populations/ha/yr) over the same time period (

Therefore, although new populations may continue to appear on the landscape, they may not balance the losses from extinctions. Also they are not readily recorded unless they are discovered during new searches, contributing to the lack of reliability of land management databases.
