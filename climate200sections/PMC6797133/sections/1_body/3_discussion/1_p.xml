<p>We found that population size, time between surveys, and elevation predicted extinction in 
 <italic>Cypripedium fasciculatum</italic>. When these factors were used to model the persistence of wild populations, we found that only 55% of populations reported in land management databases (GeoBOB and NRIS-Terra) for California and Oregon are likely still present on the landscape. Extinction rates are predicted to be higher in Oregon than in California, primarily due to the lower average population size and elevation there. Many orchid species have populations with a wide range of sizes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and small average population sizes are common. The average population size of 
 <italic>Cypripedium fasciculatum</italic> in California and Oregon was 25 individuals. The average population of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>kentuckiense</italic> has 40 individuals, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>calceolus</italic> in Europe generally has populations with fewer than 100 plants, and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>dickensonianum</italic> occurs as small colonies or single individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As population size declines in orchid species, gene flow by pollen may decline [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], inbreeding may increase [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], pollination, fruit set and seedling recruitment may decrease [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], genetic drift may increase [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and genetic diversity may decline [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Transition matrix models of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>calceolus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] indicate extinction probability over a 100 year period in populations with 10 plants is 37%, and in populations with 5 plants it increases to 67% without disturbance. In populations where flowers are removed or plants are dug up, extinction probability rapidly approaches 100%. The typically low population size in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> was a major contributor to the high rate of predicted extinctions we have shown empirically for the species.
