<p>Because orchids depend on fungi, at least in the early stages of plant development, the presence of appropriate fungi and the environmental factors that affect them may in turn determine the growth and survival of many orchids [

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> populations. Soil and topography, and especially temperature and moisture are the most important factors that control orchid distribution and survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and this may be due to the influence of these factors on mycorrhizal fungi. 
 <italic>Cypripedium</italic> spp. are associated with fungi in the Sebacinaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae, and especially the Tulasnellaceae [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The degree of specificity of orchids with fungi is significant because orchids with highly specific associations may be more sensitive to disturbance and environmental change than generalist species [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Further, climate and fungal symbionts of orchids may interact to shape the evolutionary response of specific vital rates to climate change, such as sprouting after dormancy [
