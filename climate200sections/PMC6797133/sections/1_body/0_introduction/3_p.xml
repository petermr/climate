<p>The number of individuals present can also affect the viability of plant populations, with small populations having greater risk of extirpation. In general, the extinction probability of a population increases as population size decreases [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Small populations may be at greater risk of extinction because of several factors, including losses in reproductive individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and accumulation of genetic load [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In empirical studies that surveyed the same locations of multiple plant species over several years in Germany [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the Swiss Jura Mountains [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], extinction rates were found to be higher for small populations. And although population size may be a strong predictor of population vulnerability, passage of time can compound the likelihood of extinction because as more time passes in stochastic environments the chances that a population will fall to zero increase [
