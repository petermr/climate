 <caption> Relationships of ENSO and PDO teleconnections on simulated water temperatures. Bars show simulated water temperatures differences between the strongest 1997–98 El-Niño and 1973–74 La-Niña events. Triangles represent the magnitude of differences in summer water temperature during the positive (1977–2002) and negative (1955–1976) phases of the PDO. Triangles with black dots denote trends significant at p &lt; 0.05 (computed using t-test statistics) with p-values provided in Supplementary Tables  S8 and S9. Map generated using ESRI ArcMap 10.5.1 ( http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/). </caption>
