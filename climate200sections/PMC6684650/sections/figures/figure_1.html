 <caption> Map of the FRB in BC showing the 17 selected river sites (See Table  1 for the abbreviations). These sites were used to apply quality control and analysis on available observed water temperature time series and implementation of the Air2Stream model. Colours represent the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values revealing the performance of the model simulations during the calibration time period as reported in Supplementary Table  S3. Map generated using ESRI ArcMap 10.5.1 ( http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/). </caption>
