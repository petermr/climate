<p id="Par23">Simulated averaged responses of the summer water temperature climatology and frequency distribution in the upper, middle and lower FRB show climate change impacts on river water temperature from the 1960s to 2000s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In the upper and middle FRB, the mean summer water temperatures warm by nearly 1.0 °C in the 2000s compared to the 1960s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,c</xref>) with increases of ~1.5 °C in the lower FRB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). In addition, the timing of the peak summer water temperature changes consistently from the 1960s to 2000s in each section of the FRB. The averaged response of water temperatures in the upper and middle FRB shows a 12-day shift in the timing of maximum summer water temperature from 2 August in the 1960s to 14 August in the 2000s, with a more modest 5-day delay in the lower FRB (from 12 August in the 1960s to 17 August in the 2000s). The timing of peak summer water temperature at individual sites closely resembles their mean response in the upper, middle and lower FRB. The temporal changes of maximum summer water temperature and corresponding day of occurrence further reveals the increasing frequency of warmer water temperature days and delay in the timing of river sites especially in the upper and middle Fraser (Supplementary Fig.
