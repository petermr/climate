 </sup> across the FRB. Model results show that for all 17 study sites, NSE values range from 0.76 to 0.97 for the calibration period (average 0.91 ± 0.06), indicating high reliability of model simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). While the mean daily BIAS is small (0.07 °C, range −0.06 °C to 0.28 °C), daily RMSE scores average 1.26 °C and range between 0.85 °C to 2.04 °C across the FRB during the calibration period (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Higher RMSE scores are mainly due to higher day-to-day variability in the observed data, which remains challenging for the Air2Stream model to simulate accurately. This may be due to the gap-filling and spatial smoothing procedures applied to generate continuous and homogenous daily air temperature in the ANUSPLIN dataset that may have suppressed rapid air temperature fluctuations. The resulting Air2Stream simulations therefore show dampened daily variability in simulated water temperatures when compared to observations. For the summer season on an interannual time scale, however, the model performs much better, particularly with respect to RMSE. During the calibration period summer RMSE values average 0.66 °C and range between 0.32 °C to 1.14 °C.
