<p id="Par21">At FHG, the 66-year mean of simulated summer water temperature (16.10 °C) approaches the observed mean (15.97 °C) with a cross correlation between simulated and observed time series of 0.84. The model, however, underestimates the FHG trend magnitude compared to observations (0.98 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup> vs. 1.57 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Furthermore, the interannual variability of simulated summer water temperature is slightly lower than observed variability (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The 66-year comparison between simulated and observed water temperatures is only possible for FHG considering the limited availability of long-term observations for all remaining sites. Comparison of simulated water temperature with gridded air temperature shows summer water temperatures nearly 2.0 °C to 4.0 °C warmer than air temperatures for most of river sites in the northern FRB. At the FSY, QQL, HHY, STC, TAT, FHG and HMR sites, however, mean summer water and air temperature magnitudes are almost similar, revealing these variables are strongly coupled at these sites.
