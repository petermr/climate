<p id="Par28">Mean air temperature remains a key driver of changes in simulated summer water temperatures for all sites except NFF and SGN where discharge imposes a dominant control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Comparison of regression coefficients b
 <sub>1</sub> and b
 <sub>2</sub> for individual months shows, for most sites, air temperature contributions to water temperature increase after mid-summer whereas discharge contributions decrease in late summer due to flow recession (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Overall the averaged response of partial regression coefficient b
 <sub>1</sub> during summer is 0.72, 0.88, 0.74 and 0.79 in the upper, middle, lower and whole FRB, respectively (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). Discharge, however, plays a secondary role with averaged response of the b
 <sub>2</sub> regression coefficient equating −0.02, −0.15, −0.43 and −0.13 in the upper, middle, lower and whole FRB, respectively.
