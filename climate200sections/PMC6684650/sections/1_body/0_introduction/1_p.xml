<p id="Par2">The FRB, western Canada’s largest Pacific River watershed, spans one-quarter of BC from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its outlet to the Pacific Ocean at Vancouver

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Collecting water from its vast network of tributaries, it accumulates Canada’s third-highest mean annual flow (3,972 m
 <sup>3</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>), which is largely snowmelt-driven

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Among these, sockeye is the most important both culturally and economically
