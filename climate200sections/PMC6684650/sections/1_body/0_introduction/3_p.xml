 </sup>. To provide meaningful insights into water temperature changes in this region, more advanced modelling applications are needed, especially where observational data are limited on geographic and temporal scales. For example, there is only one site across the entire FRB with observed daily water temperature records for the complete study period of 1950–2015. The lack of comprehensive water temperature data limits our understanding of long-term river thermal changes, their predictability and the potential impact on species such as salmon. Insufficient data records also limit the analysis of Pacific Ocean climate variability that potentially modulates water temperatures at regional scales.
