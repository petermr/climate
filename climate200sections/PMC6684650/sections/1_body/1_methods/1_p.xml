<p id="Par6">Observed river water temperature data were acquired from a variety of sources including Triton Environmental Consultants, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and the Water Survey of Canada. Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> lists the observed water temperature databases along with data provider and location. All river sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) had at least five years of observed daily river water temperature during summer excluding the HMR river site that had only four years of data. Locations for analyses were selected based on drainage area, data availability, and importance to sockeye salmon runs

 </sup> to extract air temperatures for each river site. This Canada-wide product was developed by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and contains gridded station-based data of daily minimum and maximum air temperature (°C) at ~10 km resolution. We averaged daily minimum and maximum air temperature to obtain the daily mean air temperature as commonly used in the literature
