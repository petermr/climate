<p id="Par16">Two 20-year time periods, namely 1956–1975 (referred hereafter as the 1960s) and 1996–2015 (referred hereafter as the 2000s) revealed climate change impacts on simulated water temperatures from the hindcast simulations. We used the frequency of exceeding different critical temperatures related to Pacific salmon physiology

 <sub>c</sub>) for different salmon species

 </sup>. To account for climate change impacts on T
 <sub>c</sub>, we calculated the number of days greater or equal to T
 <sub>c</sub> = 18 °C (T
 <sub>c18</sub>) and T
 <sub>c</sub> = 20 °C (T
 <sub>c20</sub>) for the 1960s and 2000s in addition to the overall study period. This analysis also considered the impact of the Summer Temperature Management Project (STMP) in the Nechako River (NVH) by comparing results prior to and after its implementation in 1981. The STMP regulates water temperatures through additional releases of flows from the Nechako reservoir via the Skins Lake Spillway into the Nechako River for the benefit of salmon migration
