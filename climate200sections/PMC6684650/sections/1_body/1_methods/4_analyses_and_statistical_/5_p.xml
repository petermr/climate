<p id="Par17">Frequency distributions of water temperature for summer days utilized 50 equal bins with 0.5 °C spacing for each site in the 1960s and 2000s. To obtain a regional perspective of changes in distribution shape, simulated summer water temperature frequency distribution for seven, seven, and three sites were averaged for the upper (SFJ, NFF, NCF, SGN, NVH, NIP, FSY), middle (QQL, HHY, CAC, FTC, NTR, STC, TAT) and lower (FHG, FHE, HMR) FRB, respectively. The statistical significance of differences in frequency distributions was computed using a Kolmogorov‐Smirnov two‐sample test with
