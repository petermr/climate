<p id="Par7">Similar quality control methods were applied to time series of river discharge and water temperature data. The first step involved the removal of physically impossible outliers such as values &lt;0 °C for river water temperature, followed by two gap-filling methods for missing data. Linear interpolation was used to fill gaps of six days or less. Decadal climatologies were calculated and the daily values from the climatologies were used for filling gaps of seven days or longer. Finally, datasets and climatologies were plotted to identify any anomalous data before and after gap-filling. For some sites, discharge time series from different sources were combined to fill extended gaps or, if no data were available, data from the nearest site were used (see Supplementary Information for further details).</p>
