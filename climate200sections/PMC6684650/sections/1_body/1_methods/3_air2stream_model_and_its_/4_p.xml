<p id="Par11">Once the model was calibrated and validated, we integrated the model from 1950–2015 to estimate long-term daily time series for each river site and to evaluate changes in the simulated water temperatures. These simulations are referred as “hindcast simulations” in the text to differentiate them from the calibration and validation experiments reported in Supplementary Tables
