 </sup> with 2000 model iterations and 1000 population particles for each river site. Based on sensitivity runs using different optimization methods available within the model configuration, we found that the PSO method improves model simulations compared to other optimization approaches. The PSO method is a widely used calibration method

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup> with a Monte Carlo-based optimization procedure in which a large number of parameter sets are sampled and evaluated. The model was run using the numerical procedure of the Runge–Kutta 4th order discretization at daily time steps. Note that the calibration time period is different for several river sites based on available observed water temperature records (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The calibration period varies from a maximum of ten years to a minimum of five years for some river sites with exception of the HMR river site where only four years of water temperature observations were available. Since the model calibration was conducted by minimizing water temperature differences against the observations, the simulated water temperature is not independent of the observed water temperature during the calibration time period.
