<p id="Par33">Changing aquatic conditions have implications for migrating salmon in the FRB as the mortality increases markedly when water temperatures surpass critical temperatures (e.g. 18 °C)

 </sup>. The frequency of critical temperatures has amplified appreciably in recent decades (e.g. 2000s), suggesting potential increasing stress on migratory salmon

 </sup>. Perhaps surprisingly, the northernmost river system (SFJ) experiences the highest frequency of critical water temperatures due to amplified atmospheric warming in the northern FRB. Further, with a nearly 1.0 °C rise in mean summer water temperature during 1950–2015, days exceeding critical temperatures at many sites within the FRB have more than doubled particularly for days surpassing T
 <sub>c20</sub> with a few exceptions across the FRB. Our simulated increases in mean summer water and critical temperatures are consistent with past studies focusing on Pacific salmon populations in the Columbia and Fraser river systems
