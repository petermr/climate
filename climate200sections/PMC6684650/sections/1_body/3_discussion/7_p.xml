<p id="Par35">This studyâ€™s results rely on Air2Stream simulations subjected to calibration of model parameters. Available water temperature records remain limited for many FRB river sites posing challenges in calibrating and validating the Air2Stream model. The available water temperature records also have data gaps and random, spurious data entries which, to some extent, are rectified by quality control and analysis. Another limitation of the Air2Stream model application is its assumption of a stationary response between air temperature, daily discharge and simulated water temperature. Furthermore, the model cannot adequately account for all the complexities of river thermal properties, especially the effects of different surface radiative and energy fluxes. Other processes affecting river water temperatures including groundwater exfiltration, lake and river ice melting, and cold water releases from the hypolimnion of upstream lakes are also perhaps not well captured by Air2Stream. Finally, the ability of the Air2Stream model to account for the impacts of land use changes directly into its simulation remains limited, although variations in river runoff due to land cover changes (e.g. forest harvesting leading to less vegetative water demands and hence higher runoff) are indirectly included in model simulations through discharge forcings. Nevertheless, the study provides valuable insights into the historical thermal state of 17 river sites across the FRB, which will prove useful for developing future water management strategies that may affect aquatic resources such as salmon.</p>
