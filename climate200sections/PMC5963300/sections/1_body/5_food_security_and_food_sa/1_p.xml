<p>Food security is addressed by 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> Countdown from a public health perspective but does not address ecological sustainability of food security (Batsukh

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In semi-arid and highland areas, people require livestock for livelihoods and food security, using both fresh and transformed animal source foods (Jans, Mulwa Kaindi and Meile 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Black and Butler (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) refer to the complex nature of climate change and food security and integrated approaches to health which could lead to a new theory of health as an outcome of social-ecological systems (Zinsstag 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In our experience in North Mali, Chad and the Ethiopian Somali Regional State droughts affect not only humans but often kill significantly more livestock than humans with catastrophic consequences not only in milk-based dietary systems (Bechir 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In many communities, minor disturbances in livestock strongly affect accessibility and availability of animal source foods, thereby decreasing opportunities for a diversified and nutritious diet and hence increasing the risk of malnutrition (FAO 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Observations of cereal and livestock prices are crucial for early detection of hunger crises (Bechir 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Heat stress affects many animals and food crops, reducing performance, growth and yield and likely also leading to increased animal mortality (Daramola, Abioja and Onagbesan 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Fahad 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Conversely, climate change in temperate zones increases the vegetation period. However, to effectively translate prolonged vegetative periods into production growth, significant changes in agricultural systems and practices are required (FAO 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
