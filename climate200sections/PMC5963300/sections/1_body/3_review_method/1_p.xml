<p>The purpose of this minireview is to propose novel conceptual thinking on integrated approaches for health of humans, animals and plants in relation to climate change. For this review, we initially tested the search strategy by considering the public databases of peer-reviewed literature included by Web of Science and PubMed from 2007 to date using keyword algorithms because One Health was not a recognized MESH term. Using a topic search, in Web of Science 1452 hits were returned while in PubMed 1070 hits were returned. Restricting the search field to title/abstract was possible in the PubMed database but not in Web of Science. Within the scope of our minireview, we deemed that sufficiently relevant publications should at least mention the keywords in the abstracts. Thus, we used the terms ‘climate change’ AND ‘One Health’ in the PubMed database with the search restricted to title/abstract in the timeframe from 2012 until 3 November 2017. We selected the time frame assuming that climate change and One Health as related topics were likely addressed only in the last decade. A test search expanding the time frame to the last 15 years returned exactly the same results. From 38 results, 35 were included following abstract review. One was excluded because no abstract was available, one was excluded as irrelevant because it investigated an extreme bush fire event and there was one duplicate. Twenty-nine full texts were freely available and included (see online
