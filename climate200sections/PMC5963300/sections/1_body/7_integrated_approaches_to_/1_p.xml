<p>Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is an essential component of public health and of the One Health approach. Inappropriate animal and human excreta management can both contribute to the pollution of the environment (e.g. water and soils) and the spread of antimicrobial resistance and hence need to be managed jointly. Climate change leads to more frequent periods of high precipitation causing an excess in runoff and associated wash-off of human and animal feces containing zoonotic pathogens from manure-fertilized fields or open defecation to surface and drinking water sources will potentially increase the risk of disease outbreaks (Sterk

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Increased extreme events such as hurricanes and flooding, for example, have been associated with the emergence of leptospirosis that necessitates close study of the animal reservoirs (Mwachui 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similarly, for example, open defection of humans poses a risk for cysticercosis in cattle (Flutsch 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This has also been shown for cryptosporidiosis and giardia in Africa (Squire and Ryan 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The link between climate change and diarrhea, a very sensitive disease to environmental sanitation conditions, has been highlighted in a number of recent studies (Thiam 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Water and sanitation systems are very much sensitive to climate change extreme events, with particular challenges in urban contexts (Sherpa 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Cissé 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Climate warming also may lead to increased occurrence and relevance of non-cholera vibriosis in humans (Huehn 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Pollution of riverbank sediments should be considered as an early warning sign for human and animal health, notably also in regard to coastal seafood production (Martin-Diaz 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Safe procedures of integrated animal and human excrement recycling may reduce zoonotic disease risk and maintain valuable limited nutrient resources for food production (Nguyen-Viet 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Dahal, Upadhyay and Ewald 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Such procedures include the composting of human and animal excreta (Zhang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vu-Van 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). New double vault composting latrines reduce the number of viable 
 <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> eggs and provide hygienically acceptable fertilizer (Jensen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Besides infectious diseases, further risk arises from high levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutants circulating within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems which are a major concern for the reproductive health of humans (Dudley 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Many sectors (particularly agriculture, water and health) are very much interconnected. Many African states cannot afford allocating to any of these sectors sufficient resources to achieve, for example, their related targets for Sustainable Development Goals. In that context, the challenges of climate change in environmental sanitation sector are huge, and integrated approaches, like the reduction of open defecation or low cost water cleaning beds while producing animal feed, can contribute a lot in facing these, particularly in Africa (Butler 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Experts from the different sectors could work together in the elaboration of evidence-based sanitation safety plans (WHO 
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The wider consideration of integrated approaches could bring the sectors working much closely together particularly in the domain of safety of water, integrated environmental sanitation and hygiene at different levels. The integrated management entails proper water protection, efficient waste treatment methods (at the household and community levels) including tailored safe recovery, recycling, and reuse of both human and animal excreta, designing appropriate technologies, setting relevant policies and promoting hygiene in the different contexts. More specifically, a number of interventions are recommended to reduce the exposure of humans to animal feces, e.g. proper disposing of both animal feces, creating safe child spaces in households, reducing cohabitation with animals, controlling animal movements, and promoting handwashing and domestic environment hygiene (Penakalapati 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Transdisciplinary approaches, engaging scientists with communities and authorities, are proposed for sustainable problem solving (Ruscio 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and such approaches are an integral part of One Health (Schelling 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
