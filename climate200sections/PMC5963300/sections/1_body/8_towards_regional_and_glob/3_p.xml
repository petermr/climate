<p>In addition to integration of human and animal disease surveillance, modern communication technologies (Seid

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) used at the community level will provide the highest surveillance sensitivity and be instrumental in reducing time to detection and hastening etiological confirmation of pathogens responsible for outbreaks. Mobile technologies, in particular, can assist in the early detection of zoonoses and provide the opportunity to intervene before a few infections can turn into an epidemic. With mobile devices such as smartphones, relevant data can be collected and analyzed in near real time. These new opportunities have led to the emergence of infodemiology (Eysenbach 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), a new discipline within public health informatics which includes applications such as the capturing of critical incidents regarding animal and human health to predict disease outbreaks, monitoring and tracking them for syndromic surveillance and sending alerts to the appropriate health authorities (Jean-Richard 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Toda 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Social media platforms also serve as novel sources of rich observational data for health research including infodemiology. However, the challenge often does not lie in the availability of relevant information, but in its aggregation and analysis. For this purpose, standards of reporting data sources and quality are needed so that data scientists and One Health experts can evaluate and compare methods and findings across studies and sectors (Schelling and Hattendorf
