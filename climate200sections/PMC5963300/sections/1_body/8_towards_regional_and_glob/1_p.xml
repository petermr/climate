<p>Integrated human and animal surveillance and response systems (iSRS) are one of the most important contributions of a One Health approach to mitigate effects of climate change. While public health surveillance is restricted to humans, understanding vector-borne diseases and climate change per se call for an integrated One Health approach (Semenza and Zeller

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The above-mentioned example of integrated WNV surveillance in mosquitos, birds, horses and humans is a case in point (Paternoster

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Savings from early detection of pathogens in vectors would not only apply to vector-borne zoonoses but also for vector-transmitted diseases like dengue fever (Li and Wu
