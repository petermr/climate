<p>Unfortunately, public and animal health surveillance systems often fail to communicate. For example, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Mauritania was mistaken for yellow fever and detected only after communication with the veterinary services who observed abortions due to RVF in livestock (Digoutte 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Febrile illness in Bamako, Mali, is most often associated with malaria, ignoring the importance of zoonotic diseases like brucellosis or Q-fever (Steinmann 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Similarly, the Dutch public health authorities complained that more than 3000 cases of human Q-fever could have been prevented if the veterinary services had communicated a large outbreak in goats (Enserink 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It makes a lot of sense that the surveillance of vector-borne zoonoses is coupled between entomological, animal and human surveillance systems, e.g. for Japanese encephalitis virus in China (Baylis
