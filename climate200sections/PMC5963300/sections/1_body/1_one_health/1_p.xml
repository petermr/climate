<p>We define One Health as any added value in terms of human and animal lives saved, reduced cost and sustained social and environmental services that can be achieved by a closer cooperation of human and animal health and other disciplines which could not be achieved if the sectors worked separately (Zinsstag 
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, joint human and animal vaccination services for mobile pastoralists provide access to health care for populations which would otherwise be excluded and saves financial resources while sharing the cold chain and transport costs between human and animal health services (Schelling

As an example for a One Health approach to zoonoses control, it could be demonstrated that the benefits of brucellosis control for public health in Mongolia alone would not justify the cost of mass vaccination of livestock to prevent human brucellosis. But if all benefits of livestock brucellosis vaccination in the health and agricultural sectors are summed up, the societal benefits of livestock mass vaccination are three times higher than the intervention cost (Roth 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Likewise, the annual cost of human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) from dog rabies is less than the cost of dog mass vaccination. However, the cumulative cost of dog mass vaccination with PEP is equal to the cumulative cost of PEP alone after 10 years as long as rabies is not re-introduced (Fig.

The World Bank estimates a saving of 26% of the operations cost of the Canadian Science Centre in Winnipeg, hosting laboratories for human and animal highly contagious diseases under one roof (World-Bank

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Conversely, the integrated animal and human surveillance of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Emilia Romagna, Italy, shows savings of more than one million Euro, as compared to separate sectorial disease surveillance (Paternoster
