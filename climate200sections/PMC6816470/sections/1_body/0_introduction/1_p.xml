<p>Climate change is of increasing concern for seabirds because it negatively affects their conservation status and has become the third most important threat after exotic invasive species and incidental capture (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Croxall et al., 2012</xref>). In turn, a great proportion of seabirds (e.g.,Â of the Humboldt Current System) feed in a relatively narrow range of trophic levels, mainly on larger zooplankton, small pelagic fish, or squid (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Quillfeldt &amp; Masello, 2013</xref>). Most of the prey species consumed by seabirds are strongly affected by climate-induced changes on the productivity of phytoplankton, generating changes in both the abundance and fecundity of herbivorous zooplankton (small copepods and euphausiids). Consequently, carnivorous zooplankton and pelagic fish or squid are also affected (

The dynamics of small pelagic fish have been studied intensively in the marine upwelling ecosystems such the Humboldt and Benguela currents, where the collapse of small populations of pelagic fish is often followed by severe decreases in the populations of seabirds (

Seabirds face multiple imminent threats (overfishing and incidental death, pollution, introduced species, habitat destruction, and human disturbance) that may seem more urgent than gradual climate change and its associated climate phenomena (

 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Quillfeldt &amp; Masello, 2013</xref>). However, some of these threats are locally restricted, whereas the climate phenomena have the potential to alter an entire region and increase the cumulative pressures that affect many seabirds, especially endemic species (
