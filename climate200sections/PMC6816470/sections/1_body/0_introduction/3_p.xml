<p>Predicting the response of biodiversity to climate change has developed into an active field of research (

The current study aims to generate models of the potential geographic distribution and breeding of the pelican, to identify the environmental factors that affect its current distribution, and to predict its future distribution range under two climate change scenarios (moderate and severe). Our hypothesis was that the spatial distribution and breeding distribution of the pelican will decrease and that the main cause of this will be climate change.
