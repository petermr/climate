 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, Stouffer &amp; Meehl, 2012</xref>). The model was elaborated by MaxEnt auto-features (5,000 iterations). Logistic output was used for all analyses. The quality of the model was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and the continuous Boyce index (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>). Values of the Boyce index vary between −1 and 1, where positive values indicate a model with predictions that are consistent with the distribution of observed presences in the evaluation dataset (
