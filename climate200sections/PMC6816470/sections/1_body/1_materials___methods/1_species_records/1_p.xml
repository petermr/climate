<p>Pelican nesting and occurrence data were compiled from four main sources: the Neotropical Waterbird Census (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lac.wetlands.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://lac.wetlands.org/</ext-link>), eBird (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ebird.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://ebird.org/</ext-link>), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gbif.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gbif.org/</ext-link>), and the literature. The geo-coordinates for each data point were referenced from the information in the literature or through the use of coordinates in Google Earth. We excluded duplicate or unclear locations and verified the accuracy of the data. We found a total of 4,818 georeferenced data points referring to pelican sightings (in resting place, nesting sites, coves, beaches, etc.), encompassing its entire geographic distribution from 2000 to 2015. Of these records, a subsampling was performed at a distance of 15 km (cell size), obtaining a total of 264 records, with which the modeling was performed. This subsampling were conducted in R, version 3.0.2 (
