<p>The projections for the six preselected variables and the projected minimum and maximum trajectories of the concentrations of greenhouse gases were obtained. That is 2.6 and 8.5 rcp (representative concentration pathways), respectively. These values indicate increases in the heat absorbed by the planet Earth due to the concentration of greenhouse gases up to 2100, in each trajectory and expressed in watts per square meter. Thus, 2.6 rcp is the moderate projection for the scenario with the least climate change, whereas 8.5 rcp is a more pessimistic projection and represents a severe scenario with the greatest climate change (
