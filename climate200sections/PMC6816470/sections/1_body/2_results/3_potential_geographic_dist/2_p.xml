<p>The projected habitable surface area under climate change of 2.6 rcp does not presents a major change with respect to the current geographic distribution of the pelican (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">TableÂ 3</xref>). Under the severe scenario, the model predicts that the pelican habitable surface will vary depending on geographic area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, in northern Chile its habitable surface would decrease, whereas in central and southern Chile it would increase over time (
