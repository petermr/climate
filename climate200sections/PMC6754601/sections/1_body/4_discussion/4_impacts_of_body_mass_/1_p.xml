<p>Body mass of the study mammals had significantly negative correlations with the average proportion of survived grids over 4 periods (905 BC to AD 2000, AD 1000 to 2000, AD 1500 to 2000, and AD 1911 to 2000) (

However, we did not find any significant association of the local extinction sensitivity of mammals to either human population density or temperature with body mass (as well as their distribution area or the average latitude range of their distribution) during 1700 to 2000 (all
