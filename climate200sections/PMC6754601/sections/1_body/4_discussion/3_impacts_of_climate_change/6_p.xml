<p>To further illustrate how climate cooling or warming may change the distributions of the study mammals, we projected the potential distribution ranges as represented by the suitable habitats of these mammals in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, cold period) and Holocene (warm period) (

We found that in the LGM all species showed clear contraction of their potential distribution as reflected by the projected suitable habitats; elephant, gibbon, macaque, musk deer, panda, snub-nosed monkey, tiger, and water deer showed obvious contraction of their northern boundary (
