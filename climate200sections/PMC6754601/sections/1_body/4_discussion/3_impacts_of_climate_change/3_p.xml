<p>We found that local extinction of gibbon, macaque, panda, rhinos, tiger, and water deer was negatively associated with temperature in the cold phase of the premodern period (

 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and climate could affect primate birth rates, timing of births, and infant and adult female survival and physical condition (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Gibbons are more sensitive to climatic variations than other mammals (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Climate often has great impacts on activity patterns, behavioral adaptations, and the foraging time budget of gibbons (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Our results indicate that local extinction of gibbon was less sensitive to climate cooling (but more sensitive to warming) than that of the other mammals, while panda was more sensitive to climate cooling than the other mammals (
