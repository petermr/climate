<p>In this study, we found temperature showed opposite associations with local extinction of gibbon, macaque, tiger, and water deer; negative associations between local extinction and temperature were found in the cold phase of the premodern period, while positive associations were found in the warm phase of the modern period (

 </xref>). These observations suggest that both climate warming and cooling were associated with increased local extinction probability of these mammals. This finding is likely because both global warming (
