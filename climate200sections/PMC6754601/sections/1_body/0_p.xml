 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Climate is another major culprit causing range shifts and local extinctions of animals in their primary habitat (

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and Red Data lists (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), have advanced the assessment of species extinction, the quantitative relationships between local extinction of endangered species and anthropogenic or climatic factors have been rarely evaluated. This lack of information prevents us from disentangling the relative roles of human impacts and climate change in causing extinctions of these endangered species. Understanding the relative effects of different stressors on extinction is critical for taking conservation actions.
