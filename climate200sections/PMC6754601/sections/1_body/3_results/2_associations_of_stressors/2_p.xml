<p>We found that temperature had significantly positive associations with local extinction probability of gibbon, macaque, and tiger but negative associations with local extinction probability of musk deer and panda during 1700 to 2000 (

 </xref>). The local extinction probability of some mammals (panda, water deer, macaque, and rhinos during the premodern period) had a sigmoid shape with temperature with a noticeable critical value of extinction at approximately âˆ’0.5 SD for standardized temperature change. The local extinction sensitivity of mammals to the standardized temperature (equal to the temperature deviation from the mean relative to SD) during 1700 to 2000 ranged from 34.48 to 67.47% for mammals in the premodern period. The order of local extinction sensitivity to climate cooling is water deer &gt; panda &gt; macaque &gt; rhinos &gt; tiger &gt; gibbon (

The local extinction sensitivity of mammals to the standardized temperature ranged from 23.85 to 45.75% in the modern period (excluding panda, which had a negative association with temperature). The order of local extinction sensitivity to climate warming is macaque &gt; gibbon &gt; water deer &gt; snub-nosed monkey &gt; tiger. The local extinction sensitivity of musk deer to climate cooling was 8.08% over the whole study period (
