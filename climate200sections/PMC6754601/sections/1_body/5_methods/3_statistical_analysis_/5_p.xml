<p>Based on the relationship between local extinction probability and human population density or standardized temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>), the local extinction sensitivity of each species to human disturbance (or climate) was measured by the difference of local extinction probability when human population density changes from zero to 400 persons per km
 <sup>2</sup> or the standardized temperature changes from zero to +1 SD (sensitivity to climate warming) or âˆ’1 SD (sensitivity to climate cooling) (
