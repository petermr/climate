<p>All historical occurrence data from 905 BC to AD 2006 were assigned to grids of 0.5 × 0.5 arc degrees (approximately 50 × 50 km
 <sup>2</sup>, for a total of 3,568 grids in China; the grid number of each species is shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). For each grid, the years after the last observation were considered as the years of absence (local extinction); the years of last observation and before the last observation were considered as the years of presence. Years of presence or absence were adjusted to a decadal resolution to match the resolution of the environment variables.
