<p>We obtained the historical distribution data of the 11 mammal species or groups of species from a compendium complied by Wen (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), in which the occurrence time and sites of large mammals are presented based on standard histories and local gazetteers as well as physical remains discovered over the last 3 millennia, uncovering distribution data (spatial resolution: 0.5 × 0.5 arc degrees, approximately 50 × 50 km
 <sup>2</sup>) before the modern period (i.e., before 1911). In the compendium, the use of historical literature records was conservative; records lacking other supporting observations were excluded, and only confirmed records were included (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We extracted the information of mammal occurrence (i.e., year and location) from the compendium and then reconstructed the longitude and latitude of locations by referring to the book by Liang (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), which contains detailed information on location names. After data verification (for details see

 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), was used in this study, which included 63.19% of all records of the compendium.
