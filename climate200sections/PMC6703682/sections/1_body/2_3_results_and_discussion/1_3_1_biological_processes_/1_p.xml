<p>As mentioned in section 2.3, both winter and fall upwelling show a slight decrease over time for all four models, and are predicted to be stronger under NESM-o and NESM-bc than under ECE-o and ECE-bc. The decrease in winter upwelling is beneficial for stock growth, while a decline in fall upwelling is harmful. The overall resulting natural growth rate development is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Clearly, its variability is higher under ECE-o and ECE-bc for both seasons, which is in line with the higher upwelling variability. Average system productivity is highest under ECE-o and lowest under NESM-bc, particularly because of the second half of the time horizon. We observe an upward trend for ECE-o and ECE-bc. In the other two projections, the natural growth rate shows no detectable trend, but a distinct dip is visible in the medium term between 2036 and 2057 under ECE-bc.
