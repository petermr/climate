<p>Our model includes additional factors that impact the harvest curves. Market development provides increasing substitution possibilities for consumers. Consequently, equilibrium harvest becomes more sensitive to the stock level, leading to a steeper harvest function early in the time horizon and a lower equilibrium stock value. In addition, positive trends in fuel prices and technological development combine with a net low positive trend, which strengthens the upward shift in harvest functions until 2033. By our assumptions, these trends dwindle to zero until 2033.</p>
