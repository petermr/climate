<p>The colors indicate the underlying climate projection. The shapes indicate the fuel price scenario. The squares show how a fishery performs under different climate scenarios in the BAU case, in which fuel subsidies are maintained. As expected, variability under ECE-o is so high that the fishery underperforms. The fishery cannot reap the whole benefits of its favorable climate prediction. Short periods of high biomass alternate with long periods of slow replenishment. This dampens mean survival relative to the underlying high productivity. NESM-o becomes steadily more unsustainable in the medium term, leading to extinction around 2035. Under ECE-bc, this effect also plays a role, especially in the early years. Variability is high, which contributes to comparatively low sustainability even before 2030. During the early 2030s, the fishery is particularly vulnerable owing to its low productivity and high harvest pressure. During this time, variability in almost all runs eventually leads to extinction. Under NESM-o, mean survival is in line with the deterministic equilibrium. Variability is too low to have a substantial impact. Between NESM-o and ECE-o, variability is a game changer: NESM-o now outperforms ECE-o, even though the latter shows superior equilibrium sustainability. NESM-bc provides the least favorable climate prediction. Almost from the start, productivity is too low to counter the steadily increasing harvest pressure, and the species becomes extinct early on. Therefore, variability is of little relevance.</p>
