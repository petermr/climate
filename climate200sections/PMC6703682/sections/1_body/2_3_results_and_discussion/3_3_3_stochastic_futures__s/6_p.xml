<p>We can now also measure climate uncertainty, which we define as the spread in outcomes due to different climate projections. Between NESM-o and NESM-bc, climate uncertainty amounts to 4.5 years of mean survival times, that is, 26% of NESM-bcâ€™s value. The two bias-corrected projections, which were specifically adapted for a better reproduction of the observed climate, are the two with the lowest mean survival time. This indicates that if a study relies only on original biased models, outcomes may be upward biased.</p>
