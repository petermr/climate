 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows yearly total harvest as a function of biomass, as well as biomass growth, for exemplary years under ECE-o and BAU. We choose growth with a year lead on harvest, because we model growth in year 
 <italic>y</italic> to depend on SSB 1 year before that. The interpretation of the graph is as follows: if the growth function lies above the harvest, the stock shows net growth. In a non-variable, deterministic model, the rightmost interception of the two marks dynamically stable positive equilibrium (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g005">Fig 5</xref>) at which the harvest is exactly offset, such that fishers in the next year are able to benefit from stock exactly as large as in the prior year. For harvest years 2013 and 2078, such a point exists. However, for 2047 the harvest curve lies far above the growth curve. The only stable equilibrium in such a graph would be a biomass of zero. If this were the case for longer than a few periods, biomass would collapse in the deterministic case. Note that these are only singular, exemplary years. As a result of climate variability, the shown years cannot be taken as a reference for whole periods.
