 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we show how this equilibrium changes over time for all four climate projections and under the two fuel price scenarios. Consider first the black crosses that indicate the BAU case in which fuel subsidies are maintained. A downward trend in equilibrium biomass is recognizable under all four climate projections. The number of years in which fishing is unsustainable, marked with an equilibrium value of zero, also increases. Under ECE-o, few such years alternate with relatively favorable years and equilibrium biomass around 200 kt. For NESM-bc, after 2028, there are only very few sustainable years for the fishery. After about 2030, a dangerous period arises under NESM-o and ECE-bc, in which over-fishing and extinction are likely. This development ends only late in the time horizon, when the SST is too high throughout the year and the harvest decreases again. In the long term, unsustainable harvesting years prevail for NESM-o, NESM-bc, and ECE-bc.
