<p>It has been argued in World Trade Organization (WTO) discussions that developing countriesâ€™ fisheries may need subsidies to help maintain food security and alleviate poverty [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The argument is that fuel subsidies help to increase fishing effort by enabling the use of larger vessel, engines that are more powerful and by allowing fishers to travel larger distances to fishing grounds [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The ensuing larger catches lead to lower prices for consumers. The first part corresponds well with our study: Our model predicts that fuel subsidies will lead to more fishing effort. However, once accounting for the dynamic impact of increased fishing pressure on biomass, we find that eliminating fuel subsidies would benefit both fishers and consumers. Higher fuel prices, all else equal, decrease harvest. This reduces over-fishing, such that the equilibrium stock level is higher and more stable. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the circles mark the melt-down subsidy reform case. This would be the outcome if fuel subsidies were gradually decreased and finally fully abolished in 2030. In the most extreme case, NESM-o, this increase reaches 5.4 years mean survival time increase or 62 billion NPV of total rents. It could increase the BAU value by 21%.
