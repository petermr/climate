<p>Total sector benefits include the fishery’s role as a safety net, that is, income provision (producer surplus or “fisher surplus,” FS), and its direct contribution to food security (“consumer surplus,” CS). CS is the willingness to pay for fish above the monthly equilibrium price. For our downward-sloping demand curve with price on the y-axis and quantity demanded on the x-axis, CS is the area below the curve and above the horizontal line drawn at the equilibrium price (see Section J of the

FS can be calculated by summing the areas below the equilibrium price and above the inverse supply curve for capital and labor, respectively. Adding up FS and CS yields a welfare measure for food security, which takes into account the availability of substitutes, and thus, changes in the fishers’ and consumers’ dependence on fresh
