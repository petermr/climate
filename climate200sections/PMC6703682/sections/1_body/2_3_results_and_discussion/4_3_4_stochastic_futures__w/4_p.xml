 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the mean NPV is indicated on the x-axis. Again, we first concentrate on the squares, that is, the BAU case. High variability under ECE-o also has a dampening effect on rents. First, this is a direct consequence of shorter survival times. Second, ECE-oâ€™s survival year profile is right-tailed: extinction is most likely at the beginning of the time horizon, when harvest curves are flattest. The biomass usually becomes extinct early on, and the relatively high sustainability is the consequence of few runs with very long survival. Owing to discounting, the extra rents per occasional additional survival year contribute only a small amount to the NPV. In particular, the yield is lower than under NESM-o, which is less productive, but very stable. Yields are very low under ECE-bc and NESM-bc, that is, the two bias-corrected models. The low productivity in NESM-bc leads to lower potential NPV. Over-fishing and low sustainability in both ECE-bc and NESM-bc also translate to low expected rents.
