<p>To compare welfare across climate projections, we use the mean NPV. NPV is a standard economic measure that computes the sum of all future benefits in monetary units and weighs future benefits by a discount factor to capture the higher future value of money that is immediately available. In this study, we use the 2014-NPV of total rents generated in the fishery at an assumed discount rate of 3%. For the scenarios with reduced subsidy, we add the savings of tax revenue. We again compute means over 1000 runs.</p>
