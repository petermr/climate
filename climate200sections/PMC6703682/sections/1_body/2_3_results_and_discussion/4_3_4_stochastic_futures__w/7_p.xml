<p>To separately analyze changes in annual rents under climate change and to complement the literature findings, we compare undiscounted rents in different decades for each model (see Section K of the

Comparing rents in 2014–2023 and 2034–2043, we observe changes between -97% and 52% under BAU. Mean losses lie at 27% when fuel subsidies continue. This result holds only because of the (small but positive) possibility of very large benefits under ECE-o. On average, the resource would have gone extinct by 2050 in all eight model-scenario combinations considered, such that the potential mean yield for 2054–2063 equals zero under all projections except ECE-o. The risk is substantial.
