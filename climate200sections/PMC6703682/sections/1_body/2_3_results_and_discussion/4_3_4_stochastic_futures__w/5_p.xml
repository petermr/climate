<p>Using the range of total rents as a metric, climate uncertainty amounts to 57 billion FCFA, which constitutes 24% of the lowest NPV of total rents. Fishers’ rent difference accounts for 64% of this gap. We conclude that the effect of climate uncertainty is moderate. This is a direct consequence of low sustainability: short survival times mean that differences in climate projections in the medium term rarely affect rents, because in most cases, the resource by then has gone extinct. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g008">Fig 8</xref> shows the distribution of benefits between fishers and consumers for the eight models considered. The effect on income security is larger than on food security. This results mostly because the model predicts that markets develop and consumers’ dependence on fresh
