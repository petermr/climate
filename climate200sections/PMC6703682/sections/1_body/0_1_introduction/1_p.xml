<p>Fish constitutes one of the most important natural resources with respect to food security, protein intake, and income generation. More than 20 kg of fish is consumed per capita per year, and in 2018, more than 40 million people earned their livelihoods in capture fisheries [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported an increase in global mean water temperature at time of catch of 0.19°C per decade, due to fish stock redistribution. Artisanal fisheries suffer from a relatively small fishing range around their landing port, such that a redistribution of their target stock may impact their fishing success. For 14 northwest African countries, Lam et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] projected an average climate change-induced decrease in landed fish of 25.9% between 2000 and 2050, associated with the loss of 50% of available jobs in the region’s fisheries. Other countries could benefit from enhanced catch potential [
