 <sup>2</sup> of 92%, which is non-surprising considering that only 14 observations (1996–2009) are available and upwelling has been established as the main driver by previous research. The inclusion of upwelling explains 28% of the variation compared to the model without climate impacts. No issues are detected in tests for serial correlation, heteroscedasticity, and skewness at the 5% level. An augmented Dickey–Fuller test gives a test statistic of -3.874 for logged growth and a critical 1%-level value of -3.750, such that we find the data to be stationary. In the following part, we present the results and marginal effects. Section D of the
