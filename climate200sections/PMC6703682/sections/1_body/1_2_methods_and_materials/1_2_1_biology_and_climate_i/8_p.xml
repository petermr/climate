<p>The carrying capacity is estimated as 302 kt, and is significant at the 1% level. The positive impact from fall upwelling, significant at 5%, is partly canceled out by the negative impact from winter upwelling (significant at the 1% level). The latter could be linked to lower retention and colder water temperatures unfavorable for the autumn larvae, which would delay spring spawning. Thiaw et al. [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the stock growth effect of varying one environmental variable between its minimum and maximum observed levels for fall and winter upwelling respectively, where the other upwelling variable is held constant at its mean. Observed values lie between 0.2509 and 0.4103
