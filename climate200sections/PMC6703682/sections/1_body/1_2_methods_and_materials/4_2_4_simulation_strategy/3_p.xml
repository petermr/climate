<p>In the next section, we first take a closer look at changes in stock growth and the results from spatial stock distribution on catchability. Thereafter, we analyze the model behavior at mean growth and harvest pressure, and more closely consider how the equilibrium between growth and harvest pressure changes over the decades. This allows us to compare the effects of climate projections on the fishery under a stable climate, that is, disregarding short-term variability. We proceed to analyze the dynamic system and focus first on the sustainability of the fishery and the propensity for stock collapse. We then turn to the analysis of welfare effects. Subsequently, we explore the effects of abolishing fuel subsidies on sustainability and welfare.</p>
