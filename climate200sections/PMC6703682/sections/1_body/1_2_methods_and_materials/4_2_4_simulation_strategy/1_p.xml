<p>We run the simulation of the fishery and stock dynamics from 2014 to 2079 or alternatively until the fishery collapses. To account for catches from other, mostly artisanal fleets, we multiply the modeled Senegalese purse seine catches by a factor of 1.083, estimated from historical averages. We use a monthly time step, linearly interpolating fish population growth (which is estimated based on yearly data), including the stochastic term.</p>
