<p>As is common for climate modeling in the region, all four projections show systematic bias to observed values of SST and wind-stress. We use a standard offline nudging approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] for each climate scenario and apply constant monthly factors directly to the data. The coefficients are estimated through a regression model to fit the ERA reanalysis data used to estimate the biological and economic model parts. The proportional approach outperforms the approach of adding a constant in our case. The fit is better for SST than for wind stress, as the SST development is far more systematic.
