<p>We assume an iso-elastic inverse demand function for fresh 
 <italic>Sardinella aurita</italic>. Our estimates show that inverse demand is decreasing and convex in harvest (significant at the 1% level). This means that consumers are willing to pay a higher price if fish supply is scarce, and the marginal effect decreases with the quantity supplied. This is in accordance with the literature finding that fish is sold mainly in local markets [

 <italic>Sardinella aurita</italic> is an important consumption good for these local markets, and consumers respond to quantity changes. Furthermore, the price elasticity of demand is found to depend negatively on population density, a result that is significant at the 1% level. This is a sensible finding, as population density can be taken as a proxy for market size. Larger markets, in turn, spur the supply of various products at affordable prices, and reduce consumersâ€™ dependence on this particular fish. We assume that a linear time trend affects prices. Our empirical estimates show that prices are subject to a monthly positive linear time trend of 0.2%, an estimate that is significant at the 10% level.
