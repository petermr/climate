<p>Fishers’ harvesting decisions are affected by climatic conditions, prices for fish, fuel and labor, technological progress, and the stock level. We use a similar economic dataset to previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We model purse seines targeting 
 <italic>Sardinella aurita</italic> in four Senegalese regions, namely, Thiès Sud, Thiès Nord, Fleuve, and the Dakar peninsula called Cap Vert, and we aggregate the results afterwards. Thus, we limit the included catches to those landed in Senegal. Part of the catch landed in Fleuve may stem from Mauritanian waters. These catches are included, as long as they are landed in Senegal, and thus can be assumed to contribute to Senegalese fishers and consumers rents. We use monthly regional data on purse seine catches (tons), prices (FCFA/kg), and effort (days at sea, DAS) for 2001–2013, provided by the Centre of Oceanographic Research of Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT). Purse seines exhibited an annual catch share of more than 80% for 2001–2013 in all regions except Thiès Sud (57%). Price data after 2013 are not available to us, which is a limiting factor for the time period covered by our estimation dataset. All prices are given in units of 2010-level FCFA, which is the the Senegalese currency Franc de la Communauté Financière d’Afrique, after deflation with yearly World Bank Consumer Price Index data [

 <italic>Sardinella aurita</italic> prices, but fill in gaps with prices from the neighboring region or alternatively the price for 
 <italic>Sardinella maderensis</italic>, the closest substitute (4% of observations). We prolong the time series of annual biomass data (cf., Section 2.1) by using our own stock predictions for 2010–2013. This allows us to make use of 187 additional data points, which is desirable in particular for a more robust estimation of time trends. It is also important when looking at fuel impacts, as fuel prices typically are more variable over the long term. The estimation results for the time period 2001–2009, including only observed biomass levels, and further alternative specifications are provided in S7 Section. Monthly local fuel price data are obtained from the annual reports of the Directorate of Maritime Fisheries [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Prices are given in units of FCFA/liter. Local fuel prices and global prices for the internationally traded Brent crude oil are highly correlated. A strong upward trend can be observed until 2008, after which fuel prices fall to the level of 2005, followed again by a gradual increase. For climate impacts, we again use the ERA Interim Reanalysis product with a monthly time scale. We average over regional coordinate boxes between 13.5–16.5°N and 17.25–18.75°W. The dataset is summarized in Section C of the
