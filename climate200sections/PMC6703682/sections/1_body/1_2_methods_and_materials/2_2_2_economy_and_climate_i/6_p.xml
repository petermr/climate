<p>To estimate the influence of climate variables on catchability, we test several specifications, including SST, wind speed and direction, as well as precipitation. We refer the reader to Section G of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</xref> for robustness checks. An important determinant of catchability is the SST. We find a non-linear dependence with a peak of 25.4°C at the 1% significance level, a threshold which is usually crossed between May and June. This is in line with the literature, which finds a non-linear dependence and optimal catch temperatures between 21 and 27°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The stock shifts inshore in spring towards the nursing areas, when upwelling recedes and the temperature rises. The earlier this occurs, the earlier are fish within easy catching distance [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. When the temperature increases further, 
 <italic>Sardinella aurita</italic> migrates northward and out of immediate reach [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This is a natural migration pattern. Interestingly, this feature can explain why we find no negative impact of very high temperatures on biomass growth: As long as it is possible for the species to start procreating earlier in the year, the general increase in SST will not threaten larval survival, considering the fast growth rate of larvae of 2.5/cm per month [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. No other climate variables were found to have a significant effect on 
 <italic>Sardinella</italic> migration.
