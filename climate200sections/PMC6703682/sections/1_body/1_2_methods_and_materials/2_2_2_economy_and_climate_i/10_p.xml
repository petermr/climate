<p>A higher fuel price leads to a steeper equilibrium cost curve and thus, lower fishing pressure. This is in line with the literature findings that fuel subsidies have led to larger vessels, more powerful engines, longer distances traveled and overall a higher fishing effort [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast to capital interest and wages, fuel prices are independent from the fuel quantity used by the fishery. This leaves the fishery particularly sensitive to fuel price changes. An increasing fuel price pushes downwards the curve that defines harvest as a function of the stock and thus, reduces over-fishing. For a varying stock growth curve, this means that high growth years are allowed to cushion against following low growth years. Under low fuel prices, the fishers would immediately catch more, thereby swiftly lowering the biomass. Varying both climate models and fuel price trend sheds light on the interaction between the two, as adaptation takes place. The system is less susceptible to climate impacts under high fuel prices, as they have a relative dampening impact on biomass and SST-induced changes in the cost function. In summary, we expect the elimination of fuel subsidies to be beneficial to the sector.
