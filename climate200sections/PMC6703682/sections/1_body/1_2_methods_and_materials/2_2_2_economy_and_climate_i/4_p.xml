<p>The harvesting technology is modeled as a constant returns-to-scale Cobb–Douglas function from a capital–labor composite and fuel. This means that fishers can substitute between fuel, capital, and labor: If one of these inputs becomes more expensive, the fisher is able to partly replace it with other inputs. Several estimation studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], concur that substitution possibilities exist in fisheries. We choose a substitution elasticity of one to keep the model simple and tractable. Harvest production is assumed to depend positively on biomass. At larger biomass values, catches become easier, as fish are located more easily. The “catchability” parameter is used for scaling. A linear time trend on catchability reflects unobserved changes over time. Monthly dummies are introduced to represent regular harvest seasonality, for example, owing to biomass growth, northward stock migration in summer, and cultural events that impact fishing [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. One dummy variable is used per month; it equals one if the observation has occurred in that month, and zero otherwise. Thus, its coefficient measures the impact on the outcome variable that stems from the time in the year when the observation occurs. For example, if a certain cultural event that keeps fishers from harvesting takes place each December, the use of monthly dummies would show a negative coefficient for the December dummy. Moreover, harvest success depends on climate variables, which we assume are entered as an exponential function, in which the exponent comprises linear and quadratic terms of climate variables.
