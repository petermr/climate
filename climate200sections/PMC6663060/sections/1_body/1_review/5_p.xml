<p>Wildfire smoke contains many air pollutants of concern for public health, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>), ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>), particulate matter (PM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Exposure to wildfire smoke has also been associated with an increase in mortality rate. A 13.5-year study that included 48 days of wildfire smoke in Sydney, Australia demonstrated a significant increase in mortality associated with the smoke-affected days. Additionally, a meta-analysis of data from 2003 to 2010 in 10 cities in Europe found increases in cardiovascular mortality associated with PM
 <sub>10</sub> levels that were stronger on smoke-affected days than on non-affected days [
