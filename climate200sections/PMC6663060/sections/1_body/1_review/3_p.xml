<p>Governing bodies are not the only ones who suffer immense costs as a result of a wildfire. These catastrophes take a far greater toll on their victims, who often lose their entire livelihood, and sometimes their lives, in the blaze. In the course of just a few hours, people can lose their homes, businesses, pets, family heirlooms, and sentimental items that hold far more value to them than to insurance companies. Victims only recover approximately ten percent of their financial losses and are allotted a maximum of 2-2.5 years to complete their projects and close out their claims. This places an extra burden on them as they navigate a rebuilding process riddled with hurdles to overcome and permissions to obtain and ensure that their new home complies with updated building codes and regulations [
