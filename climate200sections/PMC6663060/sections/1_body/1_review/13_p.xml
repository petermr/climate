<p>Another consequence of global warming is the increase in frequency of heatwaves. Heatwaves not only contribute to the drying of the land and a subsequent creation of fuel for the rapid spread of wildfires, but also increase the mortality rate and the frequency of hospitalizations in the areas they affect. This is especially problematic when a heatwave hits an area with a normally cool climate because the residents are not accustomed to the intense heat. A review by Rossati on the health impacts of global warming states that mortality generally increases at temperatures above and below optimum value. For example, a heatwave in Europe during August of 2003 resulted in an excess mortality of 14,800 deaths. Additionally, people with preexisting, chronic conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity are more vulnerable to the heat and at risk of complications. Asthma patients were hospitalized more frequently during the extreme weather period, and the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was reported to rise by 14%. Extreme heat is also known to increase the incidence of urolithiasis [
