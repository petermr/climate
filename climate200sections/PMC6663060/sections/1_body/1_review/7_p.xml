<p>Numerous epidemiological studies show that exposure to wildfire smoke causes exacerbations of asthma. Interestingly, some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with asthma related to PM from wildfires. However, they did report significant declines in lung function among exposed people without asthma and children without bronchial hyper-reactivity [

There was an increase in both the usage of reliever medications and initiation of oral steroid use associated with wildfire smoke [
