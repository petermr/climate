<p>From 1970 to 2003, the greatest increase in wildfire frequency occurred in the Northern Rockies [
 <xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This supports climate change as a greater contributor to wildfire incidence than changes in human land use such as deforestation and logging. Westerling et al. determined that increases in wildfire frequency were concentrated between elevations of 1680 to 2590 meters and were episodic, with surges in warm years and relatively little activity in cool years. Also, they discovered the existence of a strong association of wildfire activity with changes in spring snowmelt timing, which is sensitive to temperature change. Within the period of study, 56% of wildfires and 72% of area burned in wildfires occurred in early snowmelt years, while 11% of wildfires and 4% of area burned occurred in late snowmelt years [
