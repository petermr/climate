<p>There were two significant relationships found between image ratings and questionnaire responses. There was a moderate positive correlation between the average relevance ratings of the 
 <italic>most relevant</italic> images and participants’ NEP Scale scores, 
 <italic>r</italic>(60) = 0.419, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001. This shows that participants with more pro-environmental beliefs or more interest in the environment were more likely to give the 
 <italic>most relevant</italic> images their high relevance ratings (

 <italic>least relevant</italic> images and participants’ NEP Scale scores, 
 <italic>r</italic>(60) = 0.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003. This shows that participants with more pro-environmental beliefs, again, more likely to give the 
 <italic>least relevant</italic> images their low relevance ratings (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).
