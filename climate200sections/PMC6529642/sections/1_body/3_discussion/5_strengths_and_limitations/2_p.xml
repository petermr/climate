<p>There were also many strengths to this study, most notably our appeal to climate change non-experts, both as participants and as an audience for climate change communication. Scholars recommend that this communication be shaped according to the audience (

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson-Cole, 2005</xref>), we chose to explore what visual imagery is meaningful to our non-expert participants. It is also recommended that climate communication should involve non-experts’ understanding, emotions, and behavior (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Ockwell et al., 2009</xref>), which we have done by having participants rate the images’ relevance to climate change (understanding) and arousal and valence (emotions), and then surveying their environmental beliefs (behavior). In this way our images and their ratings should be particularly suited for future use with other non-expert audiences.
