<p>Since this is one of the first research-generated databases of visual experimental stimuli related to climate change, previous research has relied on mental imagery elicited from participants (
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>) or images gathered from expert scientific sources (
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Hulme, 2009</xref>) and newspapers (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>), none of which have been made available online or are included in publications. A recent climate image database has since emerged, but is not appropriate for experimental research both in subject matter and in image data availability: images in the Climate Visuals library have been selected based on their ability to promote audience engagement and as such the library primarily contains photographs of people. While these are useful for climate communications and media, we have found that this type of image alone is not seen as relevant to climate change, and thus are not appropriate for use as stimuli in climate change research where they would be devoid of any context. In addition, many Climate Visuals photos are available online with descriptions of the photos’ contents, but do not include any data from the creators’ research, such as how the image made participants feel about climate change, as not every image was rated in the initial study. While there are links for acquiring each image included as well, not all images are available for free or to be reused, limiting the library’s utility as a stimulus set.
