<p>Our second hypothesis was partially supported by our findings. There were significant positive correlations between the participants’ environmental beliefs (as determined by NEP score) and their relevance ratings toward both the 
 <italic>most</italic> and 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant images, so it appears that environmental views were linked to participants’ ratings of the images’ relevance to climate change. Individuals with greater pro-environmental beliefs appeared more likely to give high relevance ratings to the images that were subsequently determined to be 
 <italic>most</italic> relevant to climate change, as well as appearing to be more likely to give higher relevance ratings to the images that were subsequently determined to be 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant to climate change. This seems to show that individuals who were highly concerned about the environment tended to find the images overall more relevant to climate change than participants who were not as concerned about the environment.
