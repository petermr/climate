<p>A total of 320 images were gathered from a Google search using the following terms involving climate change: (1) “climate change,” (2) “climate change causes,” (3) “climate change solutions,” (4) “climate change negative,” and (5) “climate change positive.” Search results were filtered to only include high resolution images not containing clipart that were labeled for reuse. We selected the top 100 images from each of these five searches, which resulted in 500 images. Images that were redundant across multiple searches were only included once and images of artwork were removed. The resulting number of images included was 320.</p>
