<p>The relationship between participants’ image ratings and NEP Scale questionnaire responses is also of interest. In order to accurately determine the potential relationship between participants’ ratings of climate image relevance and their beliefs about the environment, each participant’s average ratings for relevance, arousal, and valence of the 10% of images determined to be 
 <italic>most</italic> relevant and the 10% of images determined to be 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant (
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>total</sub> = 64) were correlated with their response for each NEP Scale item using Pearson correlations. The significance level was set to 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, two-tailed. Correlation strength is interpreted based on Cohen’s conventions (i.e., small 
 <italic>r</italic> = |0.1|, medium 
 <italic>r</italic> = |0.3|, and large 
 <italic>r</italic> = |0.5|;
