<p>Scholars in many disciplines have analyzed visual representations of the environment and specifically, images were used to communicate about climate change (e.g.,

 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Machin, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2017</xref>), but as 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Machin (2013)</xref> noted, there is still a shortage in studies of the image’s impact on audiences and the audience’s affective responses to such images. Past studies have found that imagery involving melting glaciers, polar bears, and destruction from natural disasters are most commonly reported by participants when asked to mentally visualize climate change (

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>), and that images depicting dramatic outcomes of climate change, such as dried up lakes or flooding, are most commonly reported as making climate change seem most important (

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). The emotional qualities of these images were only directly measured in one of these studies, which analyzed emotional valence, meaning how “positive” or “negative” a stimulus is perceived (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Posner et al., 2005</xref>). Participants rated the valence of their mental representation of climate change from −5 to +5, and the average valence rating was reported for each of the most common category of climate images (
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>). However, participants only rated the valence of their own mental imagery—every “image” is not rated by every participant, limiting the objectivity of these images and their valence scores.
