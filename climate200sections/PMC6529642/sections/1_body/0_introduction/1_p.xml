<p>In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a special report on the impact of a 1.5°C global temperature increase. The report, written by 91 authors, cites more than 6,000 scientific references and includes hundreds of scientific images illustrating the consequences of extreme weather, rising sea levels, diminishing Arctic ice, and irreversible ecosystem changes. The main argument in the IPCC’s special report is that limiting warming to 1.5°C will require that policymakers and practitioners make immediate and far-reaching changes in land, energy, industry, building, transportation, and urban policies in order to reduce human-caused emissions by 45% in the next 12 years. Arguably, over the past decade, climate change has turned from a scientific phenomenon to a cultural one (

Exploring the emotional characteristics of the imagery that the non-expert public find relevant to climate change is important in order to build a database of effective climate change imagery, which can then be used by scientists, policymakers, and practitioners in mobilizing climate adaptation and resilience efforts. Such a database is equally useful for experimental research and investigations of climate change imagery and messaging effectiveness.
