<p>There is also no way to replicate the climate change imagery evaluated in these studies, as often the imagery was mental visualizations by participants (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>). When the images were collected from permanent sources for participants to assess (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Hulme, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>), they were not made accessible for readers to view let alone use. Research on imagery in newspaper stories about climate change has also not made the images in question accessible (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">DiFrancesco and Young, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hart and Feldman, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2017</xref>). This lack of standardization of images and their limited accessibility for use in experiments thus calls for a dedicated stimulus set for climate images, similar to the Face Place (as used in 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Righi et al., 2012</xref>) and International Affective Picture System (IAPS; 
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 1997</xref>).
