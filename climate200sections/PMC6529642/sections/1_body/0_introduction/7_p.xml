<p>A different database is necessary for further experimental research on climate imagery in order to promote consistency in stimuli used, so that the direct comparison of results using these stimuli is possible. We have created such a database. We began by collecting a large number of images (see Method for details) and then invited non-expert participants to rate the images’ affective qualities and their relevance to climate change. Measuring images’ climate relevance is necessary to have both experimental and control stimuli in this database for use in future research. Images’ affect was measured using a dimensional model of emotion, with arousal (calming/exciting) and valence (negative/positive) as the two dimensions on a scale from 1 to 9, as this has been determined to be most efficient and more objective than using common emotion words like “happy” or “sad” (
