<p>The loss of tangible cultural heritage involves the related loss of cultural and social significance that is often invisible to those calculating climate change impacts (Adger et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). “Expert‐only politics runs the risk of excluding the knowledge of individuals who do not prioritize scientific explanations, who in some cases might also be the most vulnerable” (Rice, Burke, &amp; Heynen, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, p. 260). Such undervaluing can be redressed through local engagement. For example, physical and social scientists funded by Louisiana Sea Grant worked with local indigenous communities to develop a coastal resource management plan based on a combination of natural sciences and traditional ecological knowledge, organized through a geographic information system (Bethel et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The resulting information—which incorporated local community priorities and values—informs project planning and implementation for coastal restoration. When culture is considered central to reducing vulnerability, efforts are more likely to succeed.
