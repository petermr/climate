<p>Culture underpins how people perceive risks, make protective decisions, and respond to and recover from threats. Failure to identify risk increases vulnerability: if people do not initially perceive risk from climate impacts, then they will not put measures in place to reduce potential harm or otherwise change their behavior. Risk is the product not only of the likelihood and potential magnitude of loss but also of relationships and interactions between people and nature (Rayner &amp; Cantor,
