<p>TEK that is based on individual and collective experience, and employs indicators based on direct observation, is an important element of weather and climate forecasting. One such indicator is the parhelia, or sundogs, that are produced by humid air at high altitudes; these are often considered signs that storms will arrive within a day or two. Such knowledge can be incorporated into developing adaptations to ecosystem changes (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). For example, the Navajo Nation's adaptation efforts are hindered by a severe shortage of meteorological data and other scientific observations that could supplement traditional knowledge. To provide additional information and promote adaptive responses that would be consistent with cultural priorities, more than 50 Navajo elders shared their observations about changing environmental conditions (Redsteer et al.,
