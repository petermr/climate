<p>Perception affects the application of information to mitigate harm and reduce vulnerability, of oneself or others. Scientific information that public and private agencies produce may be disseminated broadly to the public or directed to specific users; one instance of the latter is the release of climate predictions to Colorado city park managers who incorporate them into long‐term decisions about optimal flood‐control plantings (Lazrus et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Whether produced by public or private agencies or by community traditional knowledge holders, weather‐ and climate‐related information is subject to assessment about its 
 <italic>salience</italic>, or relevance to the decision at hand; 
 <italic>credibility</italic>, in terms of believability and accuracy; and 
 <italic>legitimacy</italic>, or production with the decision maker in mind (Cash et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The importance of such factors is well illustrated by the case of Cyclone Gorky, which caused 140,000 deaths in Bangladesh in 1991 (Ribot, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0136" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). While nearly all surviving households had been aware of official cyclone warnings, 78% of them failed to seek shelter before the storm, in large part because false alarms in the previous year made residents distrust the warning (Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0161" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Such social memory, however, may also contribute to vulnerability reduction.
