<p>In the Arctic, archaeological sites and sacred places—which serve as reminders of seal‐hunting techniques, historical weather patterns, and community and family identity—are sensitive to damage by reductions in sea ice and permafrost. For example, Walakpa, Alaska is a modern hunting location where there are also preserved traces of human use extending back at least 4,000 years (Hollesen et al.,
