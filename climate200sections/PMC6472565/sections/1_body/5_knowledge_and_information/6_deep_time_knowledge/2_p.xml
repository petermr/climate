<p>The archaeological record provides paleoenvironmental data and evidence of contemporaneous human behavior that can be connected to broader environmental events and trends at multiple temporal scales (Minc &amp; Smith,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0148" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). That information can be particularly useful for recovering detailed, locally relevant examples of past climate impacts and corresponding human responses. Together with climate scientists, other social scientists, and local communities, archaeologists can generate data and bring together local and traditional knowledge to develop culturally and locally sensitive adaptation or mitigation strategies (d'Alpoim Guedes, Crabtree, Bocinsky, &amp; Kohler,
