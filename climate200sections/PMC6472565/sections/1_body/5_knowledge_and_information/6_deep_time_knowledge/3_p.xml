<p>Archaeology extends place‚Äêbased knowledge of adaptation as it recovers memories lost due to colonial rule, forced displacement, and outmigration (Gullapalli,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Climate change, however, threatens the archaeological record as environmental change increases erosion rates and intensifies or accelerates the effects of flooding, wildfires, invasive species, and drought (e.g., Marzeion &amp; Levermann, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). These stresses add to ongoing pressures from development (Morgan, Rockman, Smith, &amp; Meadow,
