<p>The pace of environmental learning depends on both environmental cycles and a community's capacity for remembering risks and responses. When knowledge transmission is robust, strategies for adapting to environmental change can persist for thousands of years, as shown by practices of foraging societies in the Levant and landscape memories of aboriginal societies in Australia (Nunn &amp; Reid,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0142" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In other cases, economic or political factors may disrupt or override the use of established environmental knowledge. Drought management strategies that arose during the Dust Bowl, for instance, were abandoned after only a few decades. This occurred due to high crop prices and several good weather years leading people to shorten crop rotation cycles and to reduce vegetation planted as wind buffers (Orlove, Roncoli, Kabugo, &amp; Majugu,
