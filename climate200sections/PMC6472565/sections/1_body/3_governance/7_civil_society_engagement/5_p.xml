<p>The Local Governments for Sustainability and the 100 Resilient Cities examples reflect a highly “multiscalar” approach to governing the issue of vulnerability to climate change and resilience (Bulkeley &amp; Betsill,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0154" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). States alone are no longer seen as the sole solution to the problem; effective governance to reduce climate change vulnerability now engages a range of actors encompassed by governments, civil society, and the private sector. Important issues for social scientists include: What are the bases of involvement in these groups and organizations? How do such institutions influence the negotiation, legislation, and implementation of adaptation plans at various scales? When does climate emerge as an issue that is taken up by existing social movements, and when does it create new social movements? How does consciousness about climate issues shape agenda setting and coalition formation (Caniglia, Brulle, &amp; Szasz,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)? Each question raises issues of justice and equity in climate governance, including procedural justice and fair procurement and distribution of adaptation resources (Ciplet, Roberts, &amp; Khan, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Grasso, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
