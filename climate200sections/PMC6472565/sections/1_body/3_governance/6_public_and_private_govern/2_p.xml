<p>Vulnerability reduction is a necessary goal of most organizations as they seek, on behalf of themselves and the populations they serve, to avoid threats of harm, to lessen damage if harm arrives, and to improve their response to threats. Governmental institutions, private firms, and NGOs, working separately or jointly, all engage in efforts to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Their activities involve establishing priorities for action, allocating resources, and developing and implementing plans, as well as ongoing operations for reducing vulnerability, which stems from multiple interacting drivers. But many organizations allocate few or no resources to vulnerability reduction because its potential future benefits cannot compete with immediate needs and short‚Äêterm goals. These factors present challenges to the development and implementation of plans, which often focus on a subset of the sources of vulnerability (Weber,
