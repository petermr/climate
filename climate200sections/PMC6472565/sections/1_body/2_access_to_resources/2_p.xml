<p>Climate change effects arrive on an already‐complex social landscape populated by groups with different access to resources (Kasperson &amp; Kasperson, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Access to resources—or, the ability to derive benefits from natural and human resources (Ribot &amp; Peluso, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0137" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>)—influences vulnerability by augmenting or reducing exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (Figure 
 <xref rid="wcc565-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Relevant resources comprise tangible and intangible, and private and public goods. These include private capital, liquid assets, disaster warning systems, emergency response, alternative housing, insurance, food stores, migration support, durable infrastructure, transportation, and information and communication networks (e.g., Cinner et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, the availability of these resources in any one place does not necessarily mean that people have access to them or that they may be utilized to reduce vulnerability (Sen, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0149" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>). Access to these resources entails complicated social relationships and power structures, many of which marginalized and poor populations struggle to navigate (Watts, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0169" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>).
