<p>Whether in high or low population density areas, daily activity spaces affect health and exposure to environmental toxins (Perchoux, Chaix, Cummins, &amp; Kestens, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), food accessibility (Widener &amp; Shannon, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0174" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), and the capacity for both short‐ (Faber, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and long‐distance travel (Silm &amp; Ahas, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0155" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Programs to reduce vulnerability to climate change should therefore be designed for specific social contexts (see examples from the Navajo Nation and Southern Appalachia, below). More research is needed to understand what combination of capacities, those that address specific climate‐related impacts (specific capacities) and those that address the structural deficits (e.g., lack of income, education, and political power; i.e., generic capacity) that create vulnerability, are needed in different places (Lemos, Lo, Nelson, Eakin, &amp; Bedran‐Martins, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Building these capacities and addressing issues of power, poverty, race, caste, and gender will require transforming climate change governance practices.
