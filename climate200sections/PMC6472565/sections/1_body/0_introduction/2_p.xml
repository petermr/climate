<p>When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its First Assessment Report in 1990, research on climate change vulnerability primarily framed the issue in terms of exposure to physical impacts on particular sectors (e.g., water, agriculture), regions (e.g., the Andes, Southeast Asia), and countries, but offered little by way of analysis of the social drivers of climate change vulnerability or the uneven distribution of risk. Much has changed since. In the intervening years, a vast number of social scientific investigations has generated methodological approaches, empirical findings, and theoretical insights that have transformed how we think about climate change vulnerability. Despite these significant developments, scientific and technical approaches to climate change continue to dominate, leaving the underlying social drivers of vulnerability largely unaddressed. We therefore draw crucial attention to social scientific approaches to climate change vulnerability by identifying and synthesizing signal contributions to the field.</p>
