 <caption> Potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Map indicating climatically stable suitable areas for at least 20% of each trophic guild across seven climatic scenarios. Colour scales represent the overlap of the models. All the priority areas are plotted with currently existing Protected Areas (PAs) and deforestation layers. Graphs represents the amount of climatically stable suitable areas for different percentages of a minimum guild class (solid line); the amount of area overlapped with PAs (dashed green line) and overlapped with deforested area (dotted grey line). </caption>
