<p>First, our continuous probability consensual maps were converted into a binary classification by selecting threshold values that maximized the TSS (cutoff; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The projected occurrence area was calculated by multiplying the cell area (10x10 = 100km
 <sup>2</sup>) with the cell count. Species with projected current occurrence areas &lt;100 grid cells were excluded from the analyses, to avoid overestimating the predicted effects within the focal area. Therefore, the final dataset included 501 species and 199,250 records (

The total species richness (SR) was computed by stacking the maps of all individual species for each scenario (and for each algorithm to estimate uncertainties, see next). Uncertainties were calculated as the contribution of different sources (here, the algorithms and future scenarios) to variation around the consensus maps, through the proportional sum of squares of each cell in relation to the total sum of squares using the SR maps as response [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We estimated the species range change dynamics (in terms of area gain/loss) based on the differences between the projected area for each future climate scenario and current. To highlight the impact on ecosystem functioning, these results were grouped by the trophic guild (see above) to reflect the most affected function in the study area. We also assessed the future effectiveness of current PAs by accounting for the differences in the estimated SR in each PA over the different climate scenarios. Although there are 57 PAs (37 CUs and 20 ILs) in the focal area, we grouped them in 13, since they form continuous blocks of protected area and were considered together. Thus, for this analysis we kept only blocks with an area greater than 1,000 km

Finally, for the FT species only, we calculated the size of climatically stable areas considering grid cells containing at least 20% of each trophic guild and with an increment of +10% (until 80%) in each scenario. We first stacked each series of percentage/guild on one binary map, and stacked this map with each scenario to show the suitable habitats across scenarios. Areas were considered climatically stable if the guilds were predicted to be present in six to seven out the seven scenarios. Also, a deforestation layer (data for Amazon for the year 2015 available from Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais [

The climatically stable areas, outside PAs, that potentially will maximize suitable habitats for biodiversity and having natural vegetation were considered important to conservation, and the same areas with no natural vegetation, important for restoration programs.
