<p>Finally, we summarized the ensemble of predicted species distributions (two algorithms x three pseudo-absences x models with TSS&gt;0.5) using the committee average method, where probabilities from different models were first transformed into binary according to a threshold (here, the TSS cut-off threshold) and then averaged [
