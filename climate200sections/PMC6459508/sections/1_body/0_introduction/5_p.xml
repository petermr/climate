<p>In this study, we gathered extensive species occurrence data representative of southeastern (SE) Amazonia to assess the potential climate change impact on avian assemblages. Our work encompasses 501 species (representing more than 50% of the known avian diversity of the focal area [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Using Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), we analysed how different scenarios of climate change could affect the pattern of species distributions and assemblage compositions. By grouping species based on their main diet (frugivores, insectivores, nectarivores and others [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) as a proxy to NCPs (seed dispersion, pest control and pollination), we were able to indicate the most susceptible functional group to climate change. In addition, we evaluated the future effectiveness of current Protected Areas (PAs; Conservation Units [CUs] and Indigenous Lands [ILs]) and presented focal areas for different conservation planning considering the dynamics of climate scenarios.
