<p>Our study identified a large, almost connected, and, in great part, intact block in the focal area as climatically stable for at least 20% of each FT trophic guild. Approximately the same area was forecasted for bats using the same parameters [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our analysis shows that about 55% of our modelled climatically stable area overlap with currently established PAs. Despite of indigenous lands are legally not regarded as conservation units by the Brazilian law, these areas strongly ensure biodiversity protection [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Notably, the westernmost areas are the best preserved and protected, even under heavy pressure from illegal logging and mining, as well as recent government attempts to reduce protected areas (provisional measures MP 756/2016 and MP 758/2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]) and undermine environmental laws to facilitate the implementation of large infrastructure projects (constitutional amendmentâ€“PEC65 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]). On the other hand, approximately 15% of the area overlaps with degraded areas, and the remaining 30% still have natural vegetation but no protection. Together, these areas could form a large continuous block of suitable habitat for avian species. Several studies have demonstrated that large, connected, and intact ecosystems ensure the representativeness of multiple landscape gradients, ecological effectiveness of species population size, and intraspecific genetic diversity ([

 <sup>2</sup> of forests by 2030. Most of this restoration should be in sites potentially suitable for as many species as possible, such as those pointed out by our models.
