<p>Several studies have already analysed and described how methodological uncertainty could complicate predicting the impacts of climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In fact, each stage of the modelling method provides variation that generate uncertainties (e.g., collinearity and variable selection [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]; future emission scenarios; algorithms [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]; threshold selection [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], without mentioning the uncertainties from the data which is hard to fully explore). Recent works that have partitioned and measured the contribution of the sources of variation inherent to the models, show that the algorithms are responsible for most of the uncertainty, being greater than the climatic models and the future emission scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Our results are in line with those showing that our algorithms contributed the most to uncertainty when compared with emission scenarios. Although our conclusions are based upon simulation derived from only one GCM, significant efforts have been made between the IPCC's Assessment Reports to reduce biases in climate models [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and, as above mentioned, our choice were based in recent analysis showing that CCSM4 best represent the main features over northern South America [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, our main goal is not to compare computational methods but instead to provide decision makers with an array of possible outcomes related to the potential impacts of climate change on avian assemblages, considering our large set of species data, the resolution of multi-algorithm, multi-timescale and multi-emission scenario and computational feasibility. There are two more important points that relate to our analysis. Firstly, the dependence of model accuracy methods on sample/species prevalence, highlighting that without reliable presence—absence data, no metrics yield proper estimates (even for TSS as recently demonstrated) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. True absences already are very tough to obtain because they demand high sampling effort to ensure their exactitude, which is much harder in the neotropics where species records’ data (true presences) have spatial, temporal and taxonomic biases [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, expecting for a flawless evaluation metric is unworthy when we can use the available ones in a complementary way. Therefore, we believe that our consensus maps are robust in the projections of possible distribution/composition changes of avian assemblages in the study area. Another important point is the idiosyncratic response of each species to climate change, stressing out that different species may not react in the same way and for this reason, we focus on the general inferred patterns for guild groups. Finally, conservation actions based on our results must assume a flexible strategy (i.e., accept the risks, reassess conditions in front of new evidence, adapt/change strategy) keeping in mind managing in the face of uncertainty [
