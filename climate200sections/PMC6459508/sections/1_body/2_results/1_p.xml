<p>The quality of the models, according to TSS (0.68 ± 0.11) and ROC (0.90 ± 0.05; all values above 0.80), had a high levels of accuracy (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</xref>), indicating good model fit. Temperature Seasonality (BIO4, for 80% of the species), Annual Mean Temperature (BIO1, for 67%) and Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (BIO10, for 46%) were important drivers (mean importance &gt; 30%) for many species distributions; and all species (except for 
 <italic>Myiozetetes cayanensis</italic>) have at least one predictor variable with importance greater than 30% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The sum of squares obtained to each cell showed distinct contributions to variation around the SR maps (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Algorithms are responsible for the greatest proportion of variation (FT median [min-max] = 79% [5–100%]; and OAV median [min-max] = 87%, [1–100%]), widely spread in the study area. The proportion of variation attributable to future scenarios was lower than the former (FT median [min-max] = 62% [1–100%]; and OAV median [min-max] = 41%, [1–100%]).
