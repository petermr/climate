<p>Our results indicate that a greater number of species were projected to show a range loss rather than a range gain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Independent of trophic guild, approximately 187 (49% for FT) and 43 (36% for OAV) species will potentially lose â‰¥20% of their current suitable area in the next 20 years in the most optimistic scenario (2050; RCP 2.6), and between 72 (19% for FT) and 13 (11% for OAV) species will no longer find suitable habitat in the focal area in the worst case scenario (RCP 8.5; 2070;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s004">S3 Table</xref>). In absolute numbers, FTIN accounts for most of the projected loss of geographic range size (out of the 219 species between 105 [48%] and 152 [69%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario), but proportionally the FTFR species will potentially be more negatively affected (out of the 66 species between 38 [58%] and 51 [77%] are expected to lose at least 20% of current projected suitable habitats depending on the scenario). Most of the species projected to gain geographic range sizes are from OAV group with an average increase of 234% (SD 467%;
