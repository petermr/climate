<p>The 13 mosaics of PAs in the focal area potentially protect on average 53% (SD 29%) of the species, according to current projections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0215229.s005">S4 Table</xref>; the lowest values occurred at the most southern PAs [ESEC Rio Ronuro, 13% and IL Rikbaktsá, 15%]; and the highest values occurred at the centre [Carajás Mosaic, 82%] and western [Terra do Meio Mosaic, 98%] PAs). Under future scenarios, approximately 34% (SD 14%) of the current forecasted species in each PA will potentially not find suitable habitats (disregarding species turnover), and the projected species loss displayed distinct patterns depending on the trophic guild, scenario, and PA position and size (
