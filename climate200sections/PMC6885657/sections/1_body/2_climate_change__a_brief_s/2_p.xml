<p>Climate change science has a much longer history than most people realize, dating back to the 19th century when Joseph Fourier recognized that the Earth's atmosphere kept the planet warmer than would be the case in a vacuum. He effectively discovered the greenhouse effect: the passage of visible light waves through the atmosphere to the earth's surface, their absorption, and re‐emission as infrared radiation, which can then be absorbed by certain types of gases in the atmosphere, increasing surface temperatures. Eunice Newton Foote was the first to suggest that the warming effect of the sun would be increased in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>: then called “carbonic acid”). Her work was presented by Professor Joseph Henry at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in August 1856. John Tyndall then examined the absorption of infrared radiation in different gases, discovering the greenhouse gases (GHG) CO
 <sub>2</sub>, methane, and water vapor in 1859. Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was the first to link human activity to global warming. In 1896, he published “On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Earth,” calculating that a doubling of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (now called the “
 <italic>climate sensitivity”</italic>) would give a total warming of 5‐6°C. In later work, he revised this downward to 4°C.
