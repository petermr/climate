<p>Since the FAR, the understanding of human influence on warming has improved through better earth observations and earth system modeling, with the AR5 stating that: (a) “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia"
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>; (b) "Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800 000 years"
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>; and (c) “Human influence on the climate system is clear…It is extremely likely (95%‐100% probability) that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951‐2010.”
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Special reports such as the recent SR15
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> (global warming of 1.5°C) examined the difference in impacts between 1.5 and 2°C warming, suggesting that limiting warming to 1.5°C “is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes” with “‘rapid and far‐reaching’ transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities.” A 1.5°C limit would require global net anthropogenic CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050. To limiting global warming to below 2°C, CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions will need to decline by about 20% by 2030 and reach net zero around 2075.
