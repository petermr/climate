<p>There has been little research into the effects of climate change on treatments for epilepsy. Lorazepam, used in many parts of the world as an emergency treatment for seizures, is especially prone to degradation with higher mean kinetic temperature.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref> There are few data on other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the summary of product characteristics for several commonly used AEDs do not include specific temperature recommendations, while, for example, phenobarbital tablets should be stored below 25°C.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref> Medication supply chains can be compromised even today: It is easy to see how disruption to infrastructure could threaten AED (and indeed any drug) supply, as indeed happened after an exemplar (but not climate change‐related) disruption in a highly organized, well‐developed economy in the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011.
