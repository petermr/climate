<p>A number of vector‐borne infections can cause epilepsy or seizures in the acute phase. Chikungunya virus infection is associated with seizures as part of a multisystem acute illness in 10% of patients,

 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> If climate change leads to a spread of the vector carrying the infectious agent, then there will be an accompanying risk of spread of infection‐related epilepsy or acute seizures. Predictions are difficult, because the impact of climate change on vectors is multifactorial, and may be further compounded by multiplier effects as well as actions taking to mitigate its effects. It is already the case that the climate‐sensitive diseases affect the poorest populations the most, with higher prevalence and greater mortality, for several reasons.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> Outbreaks of vector‐borne infections can easily overwhelm healthcare systems, for example, as shown by recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses, and emergence of infections in naïve populations or those that have lost immunity can be even more dangerous. Many factors related to climate change can alter vector ranges, survival, biting behavior, pathogen infection capacity, and thus ultimately the risk of disease in humans. Changes in rainfall patterns, drought‐rain cycles, and flood magnitude and frequency can all have effects, while human strategies to combat climate change, such as reestablishment of wetlands and green spaces, can, perversely, promote vector spread. Accounting for these effects in model simulations is particularly challenging, but preliminary studies suggest, for example, that climate change will favor the spread of dengue fever and other arthropod‐borne infections given the temperature sensitivity of many factors favoring the spread of infection.

 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> neurological involvement from which is a major cause of epilepsy globally. A study focusing on the risk of spread of vector‐borne disease in the UK resulting from climate change suggests that a 1°C rise in temperature would permit Chikungunya virus transmission for 1‐3 months of the year across most of southeast England by 2071‐2100, with changes in transmission ranges also found for a range of other arthropods.
