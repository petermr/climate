<p>As the climate changes, we can expect there to be particular implications for epilepsy. These impacts might manifest at the level of altered risk of epilepsy per se, altered risk of seizures in established epilepsy, consequences for epilepsy treatments, and outcomes, with effects more likely to affect those not favored in the first place by geography and economics. We can expect inequalities in epilepsy health care to be further exacerbated.</p>
