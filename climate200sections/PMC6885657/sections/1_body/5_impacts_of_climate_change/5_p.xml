<p>Malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. In malaria‐endemic areas, up to 90% of the population may have parasites detectable in their blood. 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> are associated with seizures and epilepsy,
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> particularly seizures during acute infections, and development of epilepsy has been documented following severe falciparum malaria. In addition, there is evidence that asymptomatic malaria parasitemia can precipitate seizures in those with epilepsy.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> There are many models of the effect of climate change on the transmission of malaria, with the most significant and consistent effects predicted to occur in the highlands in Africa and parts of South America and South‐East Asia.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> In other regions, the effect of climate change on malaria transmission may be minimal due to improved control measures and socioeconomic factors, although the present decline in malaria transmission across the world depends on continued support for the current control measures. However, significant uncertainties exist in these models, particularly in the areas that experience malaria epidemics. Furthermore, most of these models examined the effect of climate change on mosquitoes that carry 
 <italic>P falciparum</italic>, but it is the Anopheles species that transmit 
 <italic>P vivax</italic> (particularly 
 <italic>Anopheles atroparvus</italic>) that are most likely to increase seizures and epilepsy in Europe.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref> For example, in one model, a medium‐high scenario of climate change predicts that the southern half of Great Britain will be climatically suitable for 
 <italic>P vivax</italic> malaria transmission by 2030 and by 2080 even southern Scotland will be climatically suitable for 2 months of the year.
