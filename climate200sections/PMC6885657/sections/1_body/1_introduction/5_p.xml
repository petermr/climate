<p>Funders are increasingly supporting research into the health effects of climate change, typically with a focus on mitigation strategies. It seems unlikely that any human disease area will escape the pervasive anticipated and unforeseen consequences of climate change. Noting that the epilepsies are strongly influenced by environmental factors, we wished to start to consider how climate change might affect the epilepsies, to raise awareness within the epilepsy community of these issues, and to facilitate and promote efforts by people affected by epilepsy, families and carers, and epilepsy professionals, to begin to address what action we can take. Individuals may already be taking steps in their own private lives, for example, by working out their own carbon footprint (

 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Patients, clinicians, and scientists across the world, as a community, may have ideas and initiatives for shared observations and mitigation measures to reduce the potential added burden of climate change for those with epilepsy. We here consider the history of climate change, review the current state of science and global efforts to tackle climate change, describe how climate change can affect human health and disease, and then address the particular impacts there may be on the epilepsies, how health care in the epilepsies might contribute to climate change, what can be done to mitigate the effects, and how progress might be achieved.
