<p>Clinicians have always considered prevention to be better than cure. Minimizing the progress of climate change and mitigating emissions now will be cheaper than taking actions later when the situation has already gotten worse, although there is already a need for some adaptation due to warming from historical emissions. The challenge is huge, but it is incumbent upon us to do what we can: This is intrinsic to our commitment and duty to patient care and can be seen as part of the aim of achieving global equality of health care in epilepsy. People have managed huge challenges before—the reduction in drink driving rates, the reduced production of aerosols, and changes in behavior after the HIV epidemic. With climate change, the challenge is bigger, more global, and more urgent, but everything counts. Schools, towns, local councils, and nations have declared states of “climate emergency” (eg,

Should and can a profession take action beyond virtue signaling? And if so, what additional evidence do we need to do that? Or in fact can we not afford to wait? We acknowledge the links between epilepsy and climate change we discuss are speculative, and more research is required. And, of course, anything we can do in our personal lives anyway can contribute to help counter one of the biggest challenges facing humanity and all life on this planet.
