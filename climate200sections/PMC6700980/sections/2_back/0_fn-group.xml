  <p id="Par11">In general, the anthropogenic contribution to rate of change of atmospheric carbon, C, due to carbon dioxide consists of a source term S(t) whose form is determined by the requirement of meeting some regulatory target; and a loss term related to a carbon dioxide removal strategy. Going from the general to the particular, the source term is taken to be a linearly decreasing function of time, t, in years; viz, S(t) = R
   <sub>0</sub> - δt, where R
   <sub>0</sub> is the initial rate of emission in gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year, and δ is determined by the requirement that the emission rate be brought to zero in 80 years. The loss term is proportional to the concentration of atmospheric carbon, and the characteristic time, τ, for its irreversible removal. In particular,

   <sup>− 1</sup>, where 0.075/yr. (= 60(GtC/yr) / 850GtC) is the natural fractional turnover rate of carbon by non-engineered trees, and T is the fraction of the planet’s trees that are engineered to remove carbon irreversibly with efficiency, e. In the absence of engineered trees, all carbon absorbed during growing season will on average be returned to the atmosphere during decay, so there would be no net removal (this ignores deep ocean and terrestrial sinks which remove carbon very slowly on the time scale of interest). If all trees are engineered, the average rate of irreversible removal is 0.075GtC/yr, and in general the average removal rate is 1/τ. The differential equation describing the rate of change in atmospheric carbon is then dC/dt = S(t) – C/τ, whose solution
