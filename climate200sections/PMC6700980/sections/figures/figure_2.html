 <caption> Atmospheric carbon dioxide as a function of time in years. The triplets in the legend represent the percentage of engineered trees, their efficiency, and the mitigation start time. The last entry (black) shows the course of atmospheric CO2 when mitigation is delayed 20â€‰years. CS indicates that the source remains constant at 12 GtC/year; in all other cases it decreases uniformly to zero over an 80-year period </caption>
