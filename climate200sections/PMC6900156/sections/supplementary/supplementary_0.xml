  <bold>Figure S1</bold> Red‐backed voles (
  <italic>Myodes rutilus</italic>) instantaneous rate of change from autumn to the following spring in relation to winter maximum snow depth, 2000–2018 at Kluane Lake. There is an indication of a weak positive relationship (

  <italic>P</italic> = 0.10. Average snow depth over winter is highly correlated with maximum snow depth (
  <italic>r</italic> = 0.82,

  <bold>Figure S2</bold> Deer mouse (
  <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>) autumn population density 1976–2018 at Kluane Lake, with 95% confidence limits. No deer mice were live trapped in the forest between 1990 and 1995 in spite of extensive trapping. These data are discussed in Krebs
