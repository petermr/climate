<p id="Par16">Down-regulation of genes related to blood vessel branching and development under warm temperatures coincided with greater resistance to water loss (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We identified candidate genes underlying the response to temperature by isolating genes within the skin resistance modules that exhibited the same interaction between mass and temperature as 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. For this 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, termed the 
 <italic>interaction analysis</italic>, we identified six genes from the skin resistance modules that exhibited a significant interaction with mass and temperature. Two of these genes, stromal interaction molecule 1 (
 <italic>STIM1</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, as determined by analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0277) and rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (
 <italic>RAPGEF1</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, ANCOVA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00247), were associated with GO terms relating to plasticity of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. 
 <italic>STIM1</italic> is associated with positive regulation of angiogenesis (GO:0045766)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, and 
 <italic>RAPGEF1</italic> is associated with positive regulation of vasculogenesis (GO:2001214) and blood vessel development (GO:0001568)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. These results suggest that blood vessel development underlies plasticity in
