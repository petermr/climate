<p id="Par14">The GO term enrichment analysis of genes within skin resistance modules identified several developmental processes, similar to the DGE analysis. We found enrichment for 18 biological processes, 5 cell components, and 7 molecular functions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Our analysis revealed enrichment of genes associated with angiogenesis (GO:0016525, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.37 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), long-chain fatty acid metabolic process (GO:0001676, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.59 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>), and branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis (GO:0001569, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.31 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>). We identified two genes, semaphorin (
 <italic>SEMA</italic>) and semaphorin-3E (
 <italic>SEMA3E</italic>), that were associated with enriched GO terms for angiogenesis and also within the skin resistance modules. These two genes were not correlated to the change in

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (as determined by weighted gene co-expression analysis [WGCNA], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.396 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.442, respectively); however, they were identified as important hub genes within the skin resistance modules (
 <italic>MM</italic> = −0.603, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>MM</italic> = −0.693, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively).
