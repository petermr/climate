<p id="Par15">Our co-expression network analysis also identified hub genes associated with muscle contraction and skin barrier development that correlated to plasticity in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. The network analysis revealed 13 hub genes that were positively correlated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Two of these hub genes are associated with muscle contraction (GO:0006936, GO:0010614, GO:1901898, GO:0086006), and these genes represented the first and third highest correlation to plasticity in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. These genes were the E3 ubiquitin-ligase (
 <italic>TRIM63</italic>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, WGCNA, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.487, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 4.65 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and the cAMP-specific 3,5-cyclic phosphodiesterase (
 <italic>PDE4B</italic>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>, WGCNA, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.443, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.24 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>), both of which had high and significant module connectivity (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We also found 19 hub genes that were negatively correlated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. Of these, the highest ranking hub gene, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (
 <italic>CHRM3</italic>), was negatively correlated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.482, WGCNA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.96 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and exhibited high connectivity (
 <italic>MM</italic> = 0.628, WGCNA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We also identified the hydroperoxide isomerase (
 <italic>ALOXE3</italic>) as having the fourth highest negative relationship with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.434, WGCNA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.47 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>) and high connectivity (
 <italic>MM</italic> = 0.733, WGCNA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). These two negatively correlated hub genes are associated with the regulation of smooth muscle contraction (GO:0045987 and GO:003056) and establishment of a skin barrier for limiting water loss (GO:0061436), respectively.
