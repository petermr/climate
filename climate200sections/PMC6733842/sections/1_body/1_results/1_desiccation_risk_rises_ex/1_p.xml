<p id="Par6">Salamanders experienced an exponential rise in desiccation risk as temperatures warmed in the field (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We measured nighttime temperatures and VPDs on the forest floor during the months of salamander activity (April to October) in 2013, 2015, and 2016 using iButtons (see Methods). Physical expectations suggest that warming temperatures increase VPDs and variability in the VPD due to the exponential rise in vapor required for saturation (

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Non-linear regression analyses that controlled for site-specific and annual variation revealed that the VPD increased exponentially with air temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Warming temperatures also coincided with greater variability in VPDs, especially after 20 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The rapid increase of the evaporative demand of the air on warm nights indicates that desiccation risk increases dramatically with warming.
