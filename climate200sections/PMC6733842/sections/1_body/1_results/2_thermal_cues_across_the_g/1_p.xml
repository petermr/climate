 </sup>. We analyzed the associations between temperature, VPD, and the standard deviation of VPD over the last 30 years to determine hotspots of thermal cue reliability. Our global analysis revealed that temperature is associated with VPD and variation in VPD across much of the globe’s terrestrial ecosystems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Most regions between 50° and −50° latitude exhibited a positive association with temperature and VPD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This positive relationship was especially high in the Americas, Africa, and Australia; however, temperature may be a poor predictor of desiccation risk in the tropics due to high error in the relationship (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Warm temperatures were also associated with greater variability in VPD, with two exceptions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In the Saharan Desert and Tibetan Plateau, warmer temperatures were associated with less variability in VPD. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the greatest uncertainty between temperature and the variability in VPD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). These global relationships were consistent with empirical measurements in the Appalachian Mountains and predictions based upon theory.
