<p id="Par8">We measured plasticity in water loss physiology by evaluating an individual’s change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> over a 4-week experiment in response to ecologically relevant temperatures and VPDs. The experiment consisted of nightly exposures to a combination of cycling temperatures and humidity in a full factorial design across four treatments (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The experiment was specifically designed to evaluate whether salamanders use temperature, VPD, or their interaction as cues to regulate 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. The capacity to adjust 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> was influenced by mass, temperature, and an individual’s initial value of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> in the experiment. Salamanders that began the experiment with low 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (roughly 4 s cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) exhibited the greatest increase in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> by the end of the experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; as determined by linear regression analysis [LRA], 
 <italic>β</italic> = −0.694 ± 0.0774, 
 <italic>p</italic> = &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.378). These individuals increased 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> by as much as 68% during the experiment until they reached a maximum resistance (roughly 7 s cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). Salamanders with a high initial 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> exhibited a low capacity to adjust 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, suggesting they had reached a physiological limit. We also discovered an interaction between mass and temperature in which large individuals increased 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> under warm temperatures more than large individuals in cool temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; 
 <italic>β</italic> = 0.477 ± 0.141, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.021). Inclusion of the mass by temperature interaction improved model fit by 5%. We removed VPD from the analysis because it and its interactions failed to explain any variation in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 and 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.01).
