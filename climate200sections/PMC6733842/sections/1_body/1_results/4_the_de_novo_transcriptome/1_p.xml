<p id="Par9">We extracted total mRNA from salamander skin tissue before and after our experiments, sequenced transcripts on an Illumina platform, constructed a de novo transcriptome using Trinity (v. 2.4.0), and compared gene expression among treatments. Our sequencing results produced a high-quality de novo transcriptome for 
 <italic>P. metcalfi</italic>. Trimmomatic and ConDeTri reduced raw sequences by 12.8%, resulting in a final number of 826 million reads with an average of 17.2 million reads per sample after filtering and trimming. Average base pair quality was consistently greater than 30 along the entire sequence for each sample based upon the FastQC files. All adapters and overrepresented sequences were successfully removed. In total, our assembled de novo transcriptome consisted of over 72,700 genes and gene isoforms. Transdecoder identified 17,300 of these genes as likely coding regions. After further filtering for gene counts, we proceeded with 13,763 genes for differential gene expression analysis.
