<p id="Par17">We identified up- and downregulation of predefined physiological pathways in response to temperature and humidity using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA v. 2.1.0). In response to temperature, we found a suite of upregulated pathways involved in muscle contraction and downregulated pathways involved in thymus and liver development (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). The genes associated with these GO terms are known to be specifically involved in regulating blood vessel growth and stem cell differentiation (see below). For humidity, we found two upregulated pathways also involved in muscle contraction (though fewer compared to temperature) and downregulation of pathways involved in signal transduction and developmental processes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>).
