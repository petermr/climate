<p id="Par10">Our differential gene expression (DGE) anaylsis indicated that salamanders altered gene expression in the skin in response to temperature, but not VPD. Using the most liberal significance threshold (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.1), we found that 203 genes were upregulated and 308 genes were downregulated in the warm treatment relative to the cool. Only five genes were downregulated in response to high VPDs, and no genes were upregulated. For genes downregulated in response to warm temperatures, we found significant enrichment for 37 biological processes, 6 cell components, and 17 molecular functions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In general, downregulated genes were associated with stem cell differentiation (GO:0048863, as determined by GO enrichment analysis [GOEA], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.18 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), endothelial cell differentiation (GO:1901796, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.66 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>), and processes related to spleen, thymus, and liver development (GO: 0048536, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 7.74 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>; GO: 0048538, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 5.01 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>; GO:0001889, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.03 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>). For upregulated genes in warm treatments, we found enrichment for 30 biological processes, 13 cell components, and 19 molecular functions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Common trends among these terms included regulation of NF-kappa 
 <italic>β</italic> transcription factor (GO:0051992, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.29 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), protein folding (GO:0006457, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3.66 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), response to hydrogen peroxides (GO:0042542, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.01 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>), and responses to heat (GO:1900034, GOEA, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.23 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>). In general, we found that downregulated genes were related to stem cell differentiation and developmental processes, and upregulated genes were related to stress responses associated with warm temperatures.
