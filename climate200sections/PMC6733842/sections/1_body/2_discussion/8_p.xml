<p id="Par26">Plants and animals also have different plastic responses to warming depending on the time scale of the exposure. In response to warming over short time scales, plants and animals often increase water loss rates to offload excess heat through evaporative cooling

 </sup>. When exposed to warm temperatures during development or over longer periods of time, as in our study, organisms frequently conserve water by reducing water loss rates (or increasing resistance) to lower desiccation risk

 </sup>. Thus, organisms experience a trade-off between cooling and conserving water that determines variation in water loss rates over different time scales
