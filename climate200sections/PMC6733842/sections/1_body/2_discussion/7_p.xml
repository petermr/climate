<p id="Par25">We revealed temperature, but not humidity, as a cue for the regulation of water loss physiology at the regulatory and physiological level. Due to the unpredictable variation in VPD and the physical relationship between VPD and temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), our results provide a clear understanding for why selection may favor temperature as a cue for regulating water loss physiology. At global scales, temperature and VPD are highly correlated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that many organisms across the globe likely use temperature as a cue to reduce water loss rates in anticipation of drier conditions, especially in temperate climates. Temperate ectotherms

 </sup> support this hypothesis. In tropical climates, however, high error in the relationship between temperature and desiccation risk suggests that few organisms would use temperature as a cue to predict desiccation risk, and in support of this, some tropical ectotherms exhibit a limited capacity to adjust water loss rates

 </sup>. In regions like the Tibetan plateau, organisms might use warming to anticipate more humid conditions due to the negative correlation between temperature and VPD. These global correlations can inform hypotheses for experiments that explore thermal cues across the globe and taxa.
