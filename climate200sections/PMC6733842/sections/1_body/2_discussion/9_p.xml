<p id="Par27">Predicting ecological responses to novel environmental conditions depends upon understanding plasticity of environmentally sensitive traits. However, the role of plasticity in novel environments is contentious. In some cases, plastic responses can facilitate rapid phenotypic evolution

Despite these uncertainties, our study provides important insight into the use of temperature as a cue for plasticity, the ecological significance of tissue regeneration, and the complex mechanisms underlying water loss plasticity. Evaluating these mechanisms as targets of selection across space, time, and taxa has the potential to inform their evolutionary potential in a rapidly warming climate.
