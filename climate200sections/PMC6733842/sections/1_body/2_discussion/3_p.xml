<p id="Par21">The expression of genes related to tissue regeneration may also have alternative explanations, but we consider these less likely. Amphibians shed more frequently in response to warming

 </sup>, but in our study, we found the reduction in water loss rates (or increase in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) was associated with expression of genes related to angiogenesis and stem cell differentiation. The conflicting patterns suggest that the thermal sensitivity of shedding is unlikely to underlie the observed gene expression patterns. Being lungless, these salamanders might also regulate blood vessel formation to adjust oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange across their skin. Recent evidence, however, suggests that plasticity in

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and gas exchange are tightly coupled
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Vascular regression in the skin would thus simultaneously reduce water loss rates and gas exchange, a pattern recently observed in this species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The subsequent reduction in metabolic rate likely represents a consequence associated with reducing water loss rates by adjusting the capillary densities in the skin. The exact role of vasculature regeneration requires studies that explicitly link physiological plasticity to more direct cellular and molecular evidence of new capillary growth in the skin.
