<p id="Par28">We collected 132 salamanders (
 <italic>P. metcalfi</italic>) from the Balsam Mountain Range in the Nantahala National Forest (35° 20′ N, 83° 4′ W) during May 2016. We collected no more than four salamanders per site, and sites were distributed in a randomized designed between high (1600 m), mid (1400 m), and low elevations (1200 m) to account for potential elevational variation in water loss rates

 </sup>. Each collection point was generated using a random point generator on QGIS (v.2.1). We created a buffered region around the dirt access road to generate points at least 100 m away from the road to minimize possible road effects. We placed each salamander in an individual Ziploc® bag with moist leaf litter for transported back to Clemson University on the night of collection. Salamanders were housed in individual plastic containers (17 cm × 17 cm × 12 cm) with moist paper towels for rehydration throughout the month-long acclimation period. All salamanders were maintained in a Percival incubator (Percival, Inc.; Model #I-36VL) under a cool, cycling thermal regime for 1 month to acclimate to laboratory conditions. The cycling thermal regime was designed to mimic conditions that salamanders experience in the early spring

 </sup>. We rotated the position and shelf for each salamander every day so that salamanders experienced every combination of position (front, middle, back) and shelf location (1–4) during the course of the acclimation period. All individuals were fed crickets (
 <italic>Acheta domesticus</italic>) ad libitum. These protocols were also continued during the acclimation experiment, and in addition, we rotated treatments among incubators to reduce the chance of an incubator effect. We complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal testing and research with approved protocols from the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee at Clemson University (#2014-024). Field collections were approved by the North Carolina Wildlife Commission (#16-SC00746) and United States Fish and Wildlife Service (#MA90761B-0).
