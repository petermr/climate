<p id="Par42">We conducted a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes using the 
 <italic>GOseq</italic> package in 
 <italic>R</italic> (v. 3.4.2) to identify overrepresentation of certain GO terms
 <sup>

 </sup>. The 
 <italic>GOseq</italic> package determines enrichment of specific GO terms by incorporating the probability a gene will be differentially expressed based upon length of the gene. The 
 <italic>GOseq</italic> procedure uses aÂ random selection process to evaluate the GO category membership and enrichment by randomly sampling the given dataset to generate a suitable null distribution. Upon identifying the distribution, 
 <italic>GOseq</italic> evaluates each GO term for under- and overrepresentation. We conducted GO term enrichment on the DGE analysis and the weighted gene co-expression analysis. For enrichment analyses, we removed GO terms with less than 10 and more than 500 genes within a category to reduce enrichment sensitivity and redundancy
