<p id="Par32">Identifying environmental cues underlying plasticity requires measurements of relevant abiotic conditions. We used iButton Hygrochrons (Item# DS1923) to simultaneously record temperature and humidity across collection sites from 2013 to 2016, excluding 2014. We recorded temperature and VPDs from May to October over this 3-year period (

 </sup>. We evaluated the relationship between temperature and vapor pressure based upon the thermal preferences of montane salamanders, which occur between 15 and 25 °C

 </sup>. Hygrochrons were deployed to randomly generated coordinates using similar methods as the collection sites (see above). Each Hygrochron was housed within a custom-built hardwire mesh cage (1 cm gauge) and secured within the cage using a plastic cable tie. The sensors were placed 1 cm from the ground to record temperatures and VPDs that salamanders experience while roaming the forest floor. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded every 20 min during the sampling period, and in most cases, temperature was recorded to the nearest tenth decimal to extend the sampling period by reducing the data file size.
