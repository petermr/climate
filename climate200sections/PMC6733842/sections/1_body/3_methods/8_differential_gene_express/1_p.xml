<p id="Par41">We conducted a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using 
 <italic>DESeq2</italic> library to identify differentially expressed genes between treatments
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>. We tested for DGE by comparing the gene expression between samples collected at the end of the experiment using the 
 <italic>DESeqDataSetFromMatrix</italic> function in 
 <italic>DESeq2</italic>. We explored the number of differentially expressed genes for each treatment using two significance thresholds (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.1 and 0.001) on gene-specific 
 <italic>p</italic>-values adjusted for false discovery rate using the default Benjamini–Hochberg procedure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>. Varying the significance threshold provided insight into broad differences in gene ontology under the most liberal threshold, whereas the more stringent threshold was used to identify candidate genes involved in plasticity.
