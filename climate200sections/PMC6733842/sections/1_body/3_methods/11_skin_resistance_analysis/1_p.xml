<p id="Par44">We began the 
 <italic>skin resistance analysis</italic> using all of the samples from the experimental treatments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 32). We used the post trimmed and cleaned samples generated from RSEM (from above) to begin the analysis. We then removed any genes that had &lt;10 counts across 28 samples

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>, which resulted in a total of 9346 genes for downstream analyses. Gene counts were then normalized using the 
 <italic>varianceStabilizingTransformation</italic> function in DESeq2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>. We ensured that the dataset did not have any missing data or zero-variance genes, and we removed one sample identified as an outlier based upon cluster analysis prior to constructing co-expression networks
