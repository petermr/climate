<p id="Par45">Gene co-expression networks were constructed by building pairwise Pearson correlations between each pair of genes using the 
 <italic>blockwiseModules</italic> function in WGCNA. The resulting co-expression similarity values were transformed into an adjacency matrix using the soft thresholding approach, which favors stronger correlations over weaker correlations between genes. We selected a soft threshold of 4 to simultaneously maximize the model fit of the scale-free topology (

 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.80) and mean connectivity among genes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Then, we defined a dendrogram of the gene networks using average linkage hierarchical clustering coupled with a gene dissimilarity matrix. Finally, we used the Dynamic Tree Cut approach to merge highly correlated modules using a height-cut of 0.25 (ref.

 </sup>). These modules could then be used to understand important networks and genes underlying acclimation of
