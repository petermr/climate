<p id="Par43">We identified suites of correlated gene networks using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to improve our understanding of the gene networks and genes underlying acclimation of

 </sub>. These analyses were conducted independently of the DGE analysis. We used WGCNA to identify networks of genes (or modules) associated with plasticity of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. We refer to this analysis as the 
 <italic>skin resistance analysis</italic>. We also conducted an additional analysis to identify potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between mass and temperature within modules identified in the skin resistance analysis, referred to as the 
 <italic>interaction analysis</italic>. We designed these analyses to identify the possible genetic changes underlying specific physiological responses from the experiments.
