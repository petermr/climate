<p id="Par33">We assessed the relationship between temperature and VPD across terrestrial ecosystems to understand the potential for temperature to act as a cue for desiccation risk. We used estimates of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures and VPDs from the

These conditions are relevant to any plant or animal experiencing temperature and VPD roughly 1–2 m from ground level.
