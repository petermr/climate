<p id="Par35">We extracted total RNA from 12 individuals after the initial physiological measurements following the one-month acclimation period, but prior to any exposure to the treatments. These individuals are referred to as baseline individuals or samples. We then extracted total RNA from salamander skin tissue immediately following the final measurement of

 </sub>. Individual salamanders were removed from the flow-through system and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen for 15–20 min. After freezing, we used a flame-sterilized razor blade to shave off a thin layer of skin from the dorsal side of the salamander. We also extracted hearts from the frozen specimen using the flame-sterilized razor blade. The hearts were easily visible through the ventral side of the salamander because the ventral skin is translucent. Though heart samples were included in the de novo transcriptome, we did not evaluate gene expression differences because the analysis is beyond the scope of this study. The tissue samples were immediately immersed in TRIzol reagent (Item#: 15596026; Thermo Fisher Scientifics, 168 Third Avenue, Waltham, MA 02451) and blended using a motorized tissue homogenizer with sterilized pestle (Item#: UX-44468-25; Argos Technologies Inc., 625 E. Bunker Ct., Vernon Hills, IL 60061). Once fully homogenized, the tissue samples were stored at 80 °C until downstream preparation in accordance with standard protocols.
