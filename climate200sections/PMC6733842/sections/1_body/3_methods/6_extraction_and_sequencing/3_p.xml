<p id="Par37">We sequenced our samples using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform at the Genomics Facility at Cornell University. We sequenced singe-end 100-bp reads for all libraries. We pooled 12 barcoded samples per lane to balance sequencing depth for each sample with the total number of samples (
 <italic>N</italic> = 48 total samples across four lanes). We randomly assigned an individual sample to each sequencing lane with respect to treatment to avoid lane biases. In preparation for de novo transcriptome assembly, we trimmed Illumina-specific sequences and adapters using Trimmomatic (v. 0.36). We evaluated error probabilities of each read with ConDeTri (v. 2.3) and low-quality bases or sections of multiple bases were removed using default parameters. After trimming, reads were assessed using FastQC (version 0.11.5) to confirm that extraneous reads had been removed and quality scores were greater than 30 along the entire sequence length.
