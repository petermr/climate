<p id="Par40">We analyzed the environmental data using non-linear, mixed effects models from the 
 <italic>nlmer()</italic> function in the 
 <italic>lme4</italic> package in 
 <italic>R</italic> with VPD asÂ the response variable and temperature as a covariate. We also examined the relationship between temperature and the variation in nightly VPD because physical expectations suggest VPDs should become more variable with warming air temperature. For our random effects, we nested an iButton within the year the recording was taken. The nested random effects accounted for abiotic differences between locations and years due to local topographic effects and interannual seasonality. We generated starting values for the non-linear simulations using the 
 <italic>nlsLM()</italic> function in the 
 <italic>minpack</italic> package in 
 <italic>R</italic>. We assessed model performance by evaluating the confidence intervals of the parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the non-linear models.
