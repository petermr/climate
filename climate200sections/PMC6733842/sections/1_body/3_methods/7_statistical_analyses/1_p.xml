<p id="Par39">We analyzed the physiological data using 
 <italic>R</italic> (v.3.4.2) using linear regression analyses. We evaluated the change 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> over the course of the experiment with mass and initial 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> as covariates. Temperature and humidity were treated as factors. Change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> was calculated by taking the difference of final 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and initial 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for each individual. We also evaluated interactions between covariates and factors to assess complex responses to temperature and humidity. Covariates were scaled and centered over zero, and we assessed collinearity between covariates using the 
 <italic>vif</italic> function from the 
 <italic>car</italic> package in 
 <italic>R</italic> to examine variance inflation factors (VIF). We excluded variables and combinations of variables that exceeded the VIF threshold of 3 (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup>). We then conducted a Type-II analysis of covariance using the 
 <italic>car</italic> package to assess significance of covariates and factors. Finally, we report effect size using omega-squared (
 <italic>Ï‰</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) for each significant effect using the 
 <italic>sjstats</italic> package in 
 <italic>R</italic>.
