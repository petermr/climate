 </sub> using a flow-through system designed to carefully control temperature and humidity. Our flow-through system operated in push mode, starting with a sub-sampler pump (SS4; Sable Systems International, 3840 N. Commerce Street, North Las Vegas, NV 89032). The pump pulled air from within a temperature controlled Percival incubator that housed the chambers containing the salamanders. The air then flowed into a dewpoint generator (DG-4) to control the level of humidity (VPD = 0.5 kPa). The air then passed through a manifold to divide the airstream and control the flow rate (180 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The air then passed into the acrylic chambers (16 × 3.5 cm; volume ~153 mL) containing an individual salamander. Salamanders were suspended on top of a mesh platform in the chamber to ensure that salamanders could not behaviorally alter water loss rates by curling onto themselves. Their position was also intentionally made to mimic posture while walking on the forest floor. We ensured that each measurement was recorded from resting individuals by directly evaluating activity and ensuring vapor pressure recordings were stable—a pattern indicative of resting

 </sup>. After the chamber, the air passed into a RH-300 to measure the vapor content of the air. Changes in voltage from each analyzer were continuously measured using Expedata (Sable Systems International). Equations for converting voltages into meaningful physiological values have been extensively reported in previous research
