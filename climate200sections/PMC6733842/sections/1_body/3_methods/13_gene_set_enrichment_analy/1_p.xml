<p id="Par50">We performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA v.2.1.0) to identify predefined gene sets that showed significant, concordant differences in expression between temperature and humidity treatments

 </sup>. GSEA identifies gene 
 <italic>sets</italic> that show functionally related, but potentially smaller, changes in expression. A custom GSEA database, with each set containing at least 15 genes, was created from GO terms and enzyme code annotations of the assembled transcriptome. We identified enriched or depleted gene sets under specific temperature and humidity conditions using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1. We also determined gene overlap between WGNA, DGE, and GSEA analyses using the
