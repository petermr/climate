<p id="Par30">We exposed salamanders to their treatment by moving them to activity enclosures for a three-hour period between the hours of 2100 and 0600. Activity enclosures were the same size as their enclosures during the pre-experiment acclimation period, but they consisted of dry soil as a substrate. We dried the soil to make sure that variation in soil moisture did not influence the vapor content of the air. We also ensured that VPDs in the activity chambers reflected the desired vapor content of the treatment by placing three Hygrochron iButtons (Item# DS1923, Maxim Integrated, 160 Rio Robles, San Jose, CA 95134) on three randomly selected shelves every night of the exposure. The activity enclosures also had a hardwire mesh roof to allow air to freely circulate into the enclosure, exposing salamanders to the vapor content of the air. Salamanders were weighed prior to and after each activity simulation to ensure that they did not lose more than 10% of their baseline body mass, which we determined at the end of the 1-month acclimation period. In total, individuals were not exposed to their treatment 1.1% out of all possible exposures because their mass did not recover from the previous exposure. After five nights of exposure to their treatment, we measured

 </sub> using the flow-through system (see below). Immediately following the physiological measurement, salamanders were returned to their treatment and allowed to rest for one night. We continued this protocol (five nights of exposure, one night of physiological measurement, and one night of rest) for roughly 1 month. At the end of the experimental period, we sacrificed all salamanders to collect total RNA immediately following the final measurement in the flow-through system.
