<p id="Par29">The acclimation experiment was specifically designed to tease apart temperature and humidity as cues for physiological plasticity. After the 1-month acclimation period, salamanders were randomly assigned to a cycling thermal regime. The cool cycling thermal regime resembled the temperature cycle during the acclimation period, which fluctuated between 8 and 15 °C. The warm temperature cycle fluctuated between 15 and 22.5 °C. The cool temperature cycle was developed from conditions that salamanders experience in the early spring, and the warm cycle was developed from conditions that salamanders are likely to face under climate change assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5—near a 5 °C increase in air temperature by the end of the century in the southern Appalachian Mountains

 </sup>. Each temperature was also assigned a particular humidity treatment: dry or wet. The dry cycle maintained a VPD of 0.4 kPa, whereas the wet cycle maintained a VPD of 0.2 kPa. These VPDs correspond to humidities that salamanders experience in nature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We maintained these VPDs during the thermal regime by cycling relative humidities throughout the day. Therefore, our experiment consisted of a full factorial design of four treatments: (1) warm, wet; (2) warm, dry; (3) cool, wet; (4) cool, dry. Prior to salamanders being exposed to any treatments, we measured baseline skin resistance to water loss rates using a flow-through system (see Flow-through system). After baseline measurements, we extracted total RNA from 12 randomly selected individuals, and the remaining 120 individuals were randomly assigned to their treatments with 30 individuals per treatment.
