 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. At short time scales, these cues facilitate phenotypic changes by stimulating gene expression to regulate fitness-related traits
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. In turn, the response helps to anticipate fluctuating resources
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup> and avoid conditions that threaten survival
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. These environmentally mediated responses are a widespread strategy among organisms termed phenotypic plasticity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Plasticity allows individuals to adjust behavioral, morphological, or physiological traits within their lifetime in response to environmental conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. By operating within individuals, plasticity acts on faster time scales than evolutionary responses and reduces reliance on dispersal, which can be energetically-demanding or infeasible
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Due to its rapid and reversible nature, physiological plasticity has the potential to limit the loss of global biodiversity during severe environmental change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, such as increased desiccation risk from climate change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, we lack knowledge on the cues and underlying genetic pathways responsible for avoiding the physiological and ecological consequences of a warming and drying environment.
