  <p>Global hotspots of temperature as a reliable cue for desiccation risk. 
   <bold>a</bold> Temperature was generally positively correlated with VPD (as indicated by the slope (
   <italic>ß</italic>)). 
   <bold>b</bold> The correlations between temperature and VPD is generally strongest between 50° and −50° latitude (determined using standard error (SE) of the slope), with regions of high correlation in South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. 
   <bold>c</bold> Temperature was generally positively associated with the variation in VPD. 
   <bold>d</bold> The standard error of the correlations between temperature and variation in VPD is generally low outside of the tropics but high for areas in Africa and parts of the Amazon and south-central Asia. Figures were generated using custom script in Python (v. 3.6) using data from the 
   <italic>TerraClimate</italic> database (
