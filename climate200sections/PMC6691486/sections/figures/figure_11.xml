 <caption>
  <p>Changes in optimal performance areas within 1 h on 23 June 2017. Blue–brown represents optimal performance areas at 14:00 EDT, while blue represents optimal performance areas at 15:00 EDT. Orange represents areas of sub-lethal or lethal performance. Relative performance is based on an intertidal organism TPC with a T
   <sub>opt</sub> of 28°C. Temporal comparisons of relative performance can be an opportunity to describe thermal behaviour for mobile species. The difference of optimal performance area between timestamps represents potential thermal corridors for mobile species.
