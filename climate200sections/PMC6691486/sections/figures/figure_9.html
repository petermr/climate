 <caption> Frequency distribution of relative performance across the six timestamps on 22 June 2017 shown in Fig. 7. Relative performance distribution range from 0 to 1 (from left to right at each panel). Panels describe variations in the peaks and shape at each timestamp. The patterns of performance distribution can be quantify through performance roughness (RqP), where the higher RqP means higher distribution of performances across the site. </caption>
