 <caption> SVF of Fort Beach. SVF is calculated by using 32 search vectors per pixel and a maximum search radius of 5Â m per vector. SVF ranges from 0 to 1 for each pixel of the map, 0 being 100% shaded and 1 being 100% exposed to the sky. Note that blank spaces represent coverage by water at low tide. </caption>
