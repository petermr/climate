 <caption> Systematic workflow of the integrative framework to analyse thermal landscapes. Following the framework steps: ( i) create DEM through ( ia) image acquisition with sUAS and ( ib) image processing through photogrammetry. ( ii) Estimate surface temperatures with heat budget model. Finally, ( iii) estimate relative performance with thermal performance curve. </caption>
