<p>Methods for measuring structural complexity have also expanded rapidly in recent years with the easy access of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), i.e. ‘drones’. sUASs are now frequently used to construct digital elevation models (DEMs) and other types of 3D virtual models, providing new tools for exploring different ecological descriptors of various ecosystems. These include structural complexity in coral reefs (
