<p>Despite the large number of studies exploring the role of microhabitats and EH, comparatively few have quantitatively measured how structural complexity actually mediates the local microenvironments (microclimates) of plants and animals (but see e.g.

 <xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">Ortega 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 </xref>) showed that a majority of studies over the last two decades exploring EH/structural complexity reported a positive relationship between EH and species richness (S). However, their analysis also showed that, somewhat surprisingly, very few experiments have quantitatively explored the underlying mechanisms driving the EH and S relationship, leading them to the conclusion that this area of research was still in its ‘infancy’. Other reviews have come to similar conclusions, again pointing to a dearth of studies focused on mechanism (
