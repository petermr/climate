<p>At the same time, our ability to quantify, model and forecast the physical parameters, such as temperature, nutrients, rainfall and ocean pH, that drive these observed and projected changes continues to improve (

For example, the thermal limits of key species can be measured under natural and controlled temperatures and then compared against contemporary and projected patterns of ‘environmental temperature’ to estimate ‘thermal safety margins’, the difference between what an organism experiences in the field relative to its tolerance (
