<p>It should be noted that we used the model to estimate only rock surface temperature, which has been used as a direct proxy for the body temperature of animals with a high proportion of their body in contact with the rock, for example limpets (

 </xref>) and barnacles (
 <xref rid="ref170" ref-type="bibr">Wethey, 2002</xref>). For some animals, especially larger animals such as mussels (

 <xref rid="ref161" ref-type="bibr">Szathmary 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009
 </xref>), rock temperature is not equivalent to animal temperature, but the same approach used here can be applied on an organism-specific level by modifying model parameters (e.g.

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Dong 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref>). For simplicity we also assume that animals are sessile during low tide, a reasonable assumption for many organisms that ‘hunker in place’ during aerial exposure, but less realistic for other, more mobile organisms (

 <xref rid="ref119" ref-type="bibr">Monaco 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015
 </xref>). Notably, the model presented here does not include the role of water retention in tidepools or other small features of the rock surface, which could provide additional refugia through cooling from evaporation of saltwater, albeit at the potential cost of physiological stress from high salinity.
