<p>We downscaled solar radiation data obtained from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) meteorological database (
 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">Mislan and Wethey, 2011</xref>). These downscaled data were used as inputs with other weather data from CFSR (air temperature, wind speed and water temperature) to a heat budget model (described in 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Dong 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref>) to estimate surface temperature distribution spatially (sub-centimetre) and temporally (hourly) across all the microhabitats within the site. Still tidal elevation predictions (XTide;

 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). We ran hourly simulations for an entire year (2017, shown in Supplement A) but here focus on the 2 days of the year with the highest surface temperature estimations, 22 June and 23 June. While these predictions were not fully validated—an exercise that would require high-resolution sampling over time using sensors and/or repeated images using infrared thermography—the results are consistent with the range of temperatures reported in past studies for other sites (

 </xref>). During the hottest surface day in 2017 at Fort Beach (22 June), where the peak global solar radiation reached 883 Wm
 <sup>−2</sup>, modeled surface temperatures ranged from 25.7°C to 41.4°C, consistent with the temperature range measured with 
 <italic>in situ</italic> loggers from this site in sunny and shaded microhabitats (unpublished data). Notably, maximum air temperature on this day was only 27.8°C, pointing to the importance of solar radiation. Conversely, the highest air temperature of the year occurred on 12 June (34.7°C), but surface temperature at Fort Beach remained low because most of the beach was submerged during peak solar periods (
