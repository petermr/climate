<p>To date, most heat budget models for ecological forecasting have failed to incorporate complex topography on a spatially explicit basis (but see

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019
 </xref>, who calculated topographic complexity at scales of ~ 10 m). The major advancement in the framework presented here is to use DEMs from actual sites to estimate direct and reflected solar radiation on each surface element at very fine spatial scales, which can then be used as inputs to a heat budget model. This approach is accomplished by downscaling total solar radiation measurements recorded from a local weather station or from (reanalysed) gridded meteorological data (

 </xref>;

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019
 </xref>) to estimate spatial and temporal distribution of solar radiation at a local level. Downscaling is a multi-step process that involves (i) generating solar geometry: plotting the locations of the sun relative to each pixel throughout the day (via latitude, azimuth and motion of the sun) and adjusting the intensity of direct solar radiation through calculations of the solar azimuth and solar zenith (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 1992
 </xref>) to describe the effect of direct solar radiation entering through the atmosphere and hitting the surface; and (iii) measuring and incorporating DEM topographic variables [elevation, slope, aspect and sky view factor (SVF)] that define the distribution of solar radiation on complex topography (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006
 </xref>). The most complex of these parameters, the SVF, is widely used to measure shading in urban environments, by hillsides, and in forest canopies (

 </xref>;

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018
 </xref>), but it is relatively under-utilized in heat budget modelling and ecological forecasting. Calculated by using vectors and their distances on a hemisphere per pixel, SVF represents the amount of sky each pixel is exposed to, an index from 0 to 1, where 0 is completely shaded and 1 is completely exposed to the sky (
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Hence, this metric helps create a shade/exposed solar radiation relationship between each pixel and its neighbors (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref>). Incorporating SVF local shadowing effects into downscaling can provide a more robust model for solar radiation on complex topography (
