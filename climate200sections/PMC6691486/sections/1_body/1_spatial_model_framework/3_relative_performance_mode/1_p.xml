<p>The ultimate goal of the approach described here is to provide a method of mapping physiological performance and survival over space and time using DEMs. The simplest approach to doing so is to convert body temperature to some metric of relative performance using a thermal performance curve (TPC), which in turn is based on indirect metrics of fitness such as respiration, movement or heart rate (

 </xref>). TPCs describe the non-linear relationship (

 <sub>opt</sub>, and then drops rapidly (

 </xref>). However, they provide an easy first-cut approach in estimating performance based on body temperature. More sophisticated approaches could, for example, alter the spatial distribution of individual TPCs of animals based on their thermal history (
