<p>While these calculations ignore the role that body size can play in defining micro-refugia (
 <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr">Meager and Schlacher, 2013</xref>), this aspect could be included by considering only sites larger than a minimum area related to body size or, conversely, by spatially averaging surface temperatures to account for large organisms that themselves shade the substrate (such as seastars;

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016
 </xref>). For other, more slow-moving species, the decision of whether or not to shelter in a shaded microhabitat occurs during the preceding high tide so that at low tide they may move very little or not at all. For example, many snail species pre-emptively move to crevices and other shaded areas during high tide to avoid extreme temperatures during the following low tide (
