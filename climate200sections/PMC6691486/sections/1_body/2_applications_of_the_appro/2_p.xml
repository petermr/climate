<p>As a first attempt at rectifying the potential disconnect between the different data layers (structural, thermal and physiological) we calculated a common metric of surface roughness, Rq, the root mean square (RMS) of deviations in surface elevation above the mean plane (

 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Here we propose an analogous metric of ‘thermal roughness’ (RqT) that comparably calculates the RMS of deviations in temperature within a site (
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). These will change over time, ranging from very low values (
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>) when the sun is low, or immediately after emersion, to peak values when thermal heterogeneity at the site is the highest (
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In the example shown in 
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>, RqT ranges from 0.59 to 7.26 over the course of 6 h. Similar approaches can be used to estimate performance variability (RqP; 
 <xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Both of these approaches could be used to quantify, for example, variability in selective regimes at a site over the course of a day, season, year or over longer climatic scales.
