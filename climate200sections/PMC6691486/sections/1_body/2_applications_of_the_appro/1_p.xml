<p>The model layers presented here—structural (microhabitat), thermal (microclimate) and physiological—provide an example of the non-linear way in which EH affects the performance and survival of organisms (
 <xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Huey, 2008</xref>; Denny, 2017) and argues that knowledge of one metric (e.g. structure) does not necessarily provide a full understanding of the mechanisms by which microhabitats drive thermal ecology. As described by 
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">Stein and Kreft (2014</xref>) it has been commonly assumed that habitat (structural) complexity can serve as a direct proxy for EH and microclimate diversity (but see 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Angilletta, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref139" ref-type="bibr">Scheffers 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref> for counter examples). Certainly, physical structures such as forests, coral reefs, bivalve beds and algal canopies can drive EH through their influence on processes such as shading (
 <xref rid="ref133" ref-type="bibr">Reed and Foster, 1984</xref>) and reductions in wind or water flow (Guichard 
 <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001, 
 <xref rid="ref95" ref-type="bibr">Lenihan 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Gaylord et al., 2012</xref>), but these relationships can be far more complex and non-linear than is generally appreciated (
 <xref rid="ref94" ref-type="bibr">Layton 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). All of this points to the issue that the many approaches that have been adopted for quantifying habitat structural complexity (
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Frost 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Dibble and Thomaz, 2009</xref>), while likely correlated to varying degrees with microclimate diversity (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Ehbrecht 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref>), cannot be assumed to serve as a direct proxy for environmental conditions at the level of the organism (
 <xref rid="ref110" ref-type="bibr">Meager and Schlacher, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">Stein and Kreft, 2014</xref>). In other words, the knowledge of structural complexity alone does not automatically translate into an understanding of the heterogeneity of environmental conditions that ultimately drive physiological performance, survival and biodiversity nor does it account for the non-linear relationship between body temperature and physiological performance, i.e. Jensen’s inequality (
 <xref rid="ref107" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Huey, 2008</xref>; Denny, 2017). These issues are highlighted in 
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Figs 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, which show frequency distributions of surface temperature (
 <xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) and relative performance (
 <xref rid="f9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) over the course of a 6-hour low-tide exposure. Such frequency distributions provide considerably more information than simply bracketing the range of temperatures using the coolest (full shade) and hottest (full sun) microsites, an approach that has been used in previous studies (e.g.
