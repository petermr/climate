<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics defines pediatrics as “the specialty of medical science concerned with the physical, mental, and social health of children from birth to young adulthood.” [

Discrepancies in pediatric thermoregulation literature are therefore not surprising given the large age range and developmental stages encompassed by this field. For the purposes of this review, pediatric age categories follow US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) [

 <xref rid="B51-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] guidelines for clinical pharmacology, reflecting the underlying principle of a liner relationship between weight and growth. Based on these guidelines, pediatric subpopulations are defined as (a) neonates, 0–1 month, (b) infants, 1 month to 2 years, (c) children, 2–12 years, and (d) adolescents 12–16 years. If considering adolescent, further sub-classifications based on pubertal maturational stage should be considered. Physiological responses to exercise and heat exposure differ between infants, children, adolescents, and adults owing to differences in morphological, endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and thermoregulatory responses, yet guidelines are often modified from adult data. Infants and children have traditionally been considered an ‘at risk’ group with greater susceptibility to adverse physiological responses and health events during environmental extremes owing to inferior thermoregulatory capabilities [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Over the past twenty five years, this notion has been challenged, with limited physiological or epidemiological evidence of compromised or insufficient thermoregulatory capabilities in a wide range of environmental conditions when compared to healthy adults [

 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Many identified risk factors for heat illness in children, including hydration status, clothing, training and recovery periods, are modifiable and thus largely preventable [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The importance of many of these factors in pediatric thermoregulation will be reviewed, with an emphasis on recent advances and future challenges associated with climate change.
