<p>In comparison to adults, children produce a lower Q during similar absolute submaximal workloads [

 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Several studies have reported similar Q during exercise in children and adults, but an explanation for these discrepancies is not clear [

 <xref rid="B98-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Lower Q in children results from a lower stroke volume (SV), attributed to their smaller body size and therefore smaller heart (left ventricle) compared to adults [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Partial compensation is provided by a higher heart rate, with more complete compensation resulting from a greater arterial–venous O
 <sub>2</sub> difference, ultimately providing similar adult–child VO
 <sub>2</sub> values despite a lower Q. Children therefore have an appropriate cardiovascular response for their size during exercise. This is demonstrated when SV is scaled to body size, virtually eliminating child–adult SV differences [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Similarly, Falk and Dotan calculated cardiovascular responses at fixed relative workloads corrected to provide a body mass specific Q (based on the data of Turley and Wilmore [
 <xref rid="B95-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]), with values that were in fact ~10% higher in children than adults.
