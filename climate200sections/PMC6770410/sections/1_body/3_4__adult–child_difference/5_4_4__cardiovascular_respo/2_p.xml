<p>Despite the lower, albeit size-appropriate exercise Q in children, differences in cardiovascular responses associated with thermoregulatory challenges become apparent. Children possess a greater (~20%) BSA compared to adults, shunting a greater proportion of Q to the skin to maximize dry heat losses [

 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Higher SkBF responses are evident during exercise (50% VO
 <sub>2max</sub>) in hot–dry conditions [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and for similar rectal temperature (T
 <sub>re</sub>) responses [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Notably, comparisons of cardiovascular responses to heat are typically standardized to metabolic load (relative intensity). If absolute workloads were utilized, group differences would be artificially exaggerated owing to factors including differing locomotion and therefore greater physiological strain in children, differences in body mass and size, and potentially greater SkBF responses for dissipation of additional heat [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The high SkBF response declines with increasing maturational development throughout adolescence. Falk and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] observed progressively lower SkBF responses in pre-, mid-, and late pubertal boys (significant between all groups) during cycling at 50% VO
 <sub>2max</sub> in a hot–dry environment (42 °C, 20% rh). Considering the proportionally higher SkBF responses in children, declines in performance are understandable. Venous return and thus Q are compromised, coupled with relatively lower muscle blood flow, presenting competing demands on the cardiovascular system during exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. If conditions (heat and exercise intensity) are sufficiently extreme and exposure continues, particularly without adequate rehydration, SkBF and sweating responses may decline, compromising thermoregulatory function with potential development of heat illness [
