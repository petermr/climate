<p>Ultimately, HA reduces cardiovascular strain, improves performance, and increases survivability to extreme environmental conditions, making this a critical component in reducing heat-related illness and injury in the pediatric population [

Most of the evidence available indicates similar HA responses between children and adults, but further work is warranted if HA regimens become widely adopted as ambient temperatures continue to increase, with additional consideration for body composition, disease conditions, and medication use.
