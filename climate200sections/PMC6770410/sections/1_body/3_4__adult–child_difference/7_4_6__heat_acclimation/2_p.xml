<p>A pertinent consideration with increasing prevalence of childhood obesity (Section 2.4. Body Composition) is that obese children appear to possess a lower level of acclimation versus lean boys, likely resulting from the partial acclimation acquired through training. Obese boys show higher resting and exercise

In the instance of athletes, similarly to adults, exercise intensity should be progressively increased to emulate competition. A gradual increase in the number of training sessions per day and progressive introduction of protective clothing that may hinder heat loss should be adopted [
