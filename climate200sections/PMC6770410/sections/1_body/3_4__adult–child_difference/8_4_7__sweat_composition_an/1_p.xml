For extensive reviews regarding the physiology of water balance, hydration assessment, strategies, and pathology, please refer to other reviews within this Special Issue. In the context of this review, hypohydration in children with consideration for rising global temperatures and concerns over predicted water shortages accompanying climate change are addressed.
