<p>Understanding optimal fluid composition and replacement strategies should be a priority in children, not only for performance but also overall health and safety. Hydration guidelines in children are often based on adult data, yet adultâ€“child differences in sweat electrolyte concentrations, variation with intensity and duration, and marked differences in SR are evident. Coupled with greater voluntary dehydration in children [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], beverage composition and hydration guidelines need tailoring specifically to children and the intensity and environment in which they are exercising. Drink palatability, including flavor and temperature, are also important when considering fluid replacement in children. In the face of predicted rising average global temperatures, increased severity and frequency of heatwaves, and predicted water shortages, tailored hydration strategies will be increasingly important not only for those exercising in the heat, but for daily activates and prolonged periods outside in the heat (i.e., summer camps).
