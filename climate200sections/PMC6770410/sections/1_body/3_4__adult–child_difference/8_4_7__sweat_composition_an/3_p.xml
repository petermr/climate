<p>Both adults [

 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] often hydrate inadequately, but the effects of chronic low fluid intake and dehydration on health are not well understood. As global climate change progresses, knowledge of the complex and multifaceted interplay of factors influencing thermoregulatory function is important. Although speculative, consideration needs to be given to pediatric fluid intake as it pertains to chronic health, with the mindset of encouraging “preventative” habits for long-term health and risk reduction. In adults, fluid intake (typically self-reported) provides conflicting results regarding cardiometabolic disease risk, in part due to failure of investigators to report plain water consumption versus intake of other fluids, including sweetened beverages [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Evidence does indicate low fluid intake is independently associated with developing hyperglycemia [
 <xref rid="B145-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], type 2 diabetes mellitus [
 <xref rid="B146-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], and renal dysfunction including chronic kidney disease (CKD) [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>], with inconsistent evidence of cardiovascular disease risk. The putative link between hydration and long-term health in adults remains controversial but certainly warrants consideration in children. This is particularly concerning in light of climate change potentially exacerbating dehydration risk, coupled with the high incidence of overweight and obese children in the western world, already at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Limited research has assessed the relationship between fluid intake and childhood obesity, but there is some indication that obese children are less hydrated compared to those of normal weight. Maffeis and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] determined significantly lower hydration in obese versus normal weight children (7–11 years), based on average free water reserve over 48 h. In adults, Guelinckx and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] raise the concept of increased plain water intake as a mechanism to reduce renal and metabolic dysfunction. Risk reduction for CKD and vascular dysfunction in adults has also been observed with high water intake (&gt;2.6 L/day) but not sweetened beverages [
 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,
 <xref rid="B148-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. In children, albeit speculative, perhaps this approach serves to not only improve hydration and thermoregulatory function but reduce or limit the risk of renal and metabolic dysfunction.
