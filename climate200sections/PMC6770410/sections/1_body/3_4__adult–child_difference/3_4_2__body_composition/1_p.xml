<p>Obesity is widely recognized as a risk factor for heat-related illness and injury in both adults and children [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The most recent nationally representative estimates from the United States indicate that the prevalence of childhood obesity is continuing to increase: In 2015–2016, 35% of 2–19-year-olds in the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) were overweight (BMI ≥85th CDC percentile), and a further 24.5% obese (BMI ≥95th percentile) [
 <xref rid="B62-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Globally, 50 (24–89) million girls and 70 (39–125) boys aged 5–19 years are estimated to be obese (2SD above the WHO median) [
 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the context of the increasing incidence of overweight and obesity in children both in the USA and internationally, coupled with increasing average global temperatures, appropriate risk assessment and safety guidelines for exercise in the heat are critically important [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The majority of data regarding body composition and thermoregulation concerns adults, with considerable discrepancies in the literature. Several studies indicate similar responses during passive heating [
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] or exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], whilst others demonstrate blunted thermoregulatory (sweating) responses [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and increased thermal strain (

 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Notably, most studies appear confounded by the effects of body mass and/or heat production introducing a systematic bias owing to study design and not adiposity per se [
 <xref rid="B68-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. When metabolic heat production is fixed, some of the differences are mitigated [
 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Several studies in children similarly demonstrate the physiological disadvantage of higher adiposity during exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Higher visceral and subcutaneous fat deposits, combined with a typically lower BSA to mass ratio, may contribute to hindered heat loss in obese versus lean children [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. By contrast, a small number of studies indicate similar heat tolerance of obese or overweight compared to normal weight children during exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This has been suggested by other authors to result in part from three exercise heat acclimation sessions conducted prior to testing, which were not discussed in the studies themselves [
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Studies incorporating exercise/heat acclimation sessions prior to experimental testing may reduce differences in thermoregulatory responses between groups but in applied terms have important implications for reducing heat illness risk in obese children.
