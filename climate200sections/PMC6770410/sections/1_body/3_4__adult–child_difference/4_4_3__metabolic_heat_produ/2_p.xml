<p>For children with disabilities or disease that affects mobility, low locomotion efficiency results in large energy expenditure compared to healthy or typically developing children. For example, cerebral palsy, the most common childhood disability in the United States, causes a high metabolic demand on daily activates. Walking efficiency is three times higher in cerebral palsy children, affecting participation in daily activities and overall quality of life [

Specific metabolic demands of activities in children are important in the context of safe exercise practices and thermoregulation in extreme environments, with important consideration and modifications to activities for children with disabilities affecting movement.
