 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The very limits of human thermoregulation may be tested, with multiple combined stressors of heat, dehydration, UV radiation, pollution, and noise and disease transmission all exacerbating physiological strain [

 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This review aims to address the topic of thermoregulation in the context of global climate challenges with emphasis placed on children, who are considered an ‘at risk’ population for increased morbidity and mortality during heat events and a range of environmental stressors.
