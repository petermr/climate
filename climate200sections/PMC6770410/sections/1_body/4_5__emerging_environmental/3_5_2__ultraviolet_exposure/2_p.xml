<p>Despite the largely negative literature surrounding UV exposure, it is important in many physiological processes, with skeletal disease and vitamin D insufficiency associated with inadequate exposure. Some evidence indicates a regulatory role in blood pressure via calcium homeostasis and vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub>, with artificial UVB exposure lowering blood pressure in mild, unmedicated hypertensives [

Photoimmunology, an emerging field of study regarding how UV radiation impacts immune function, is a reminder of how limited current knowledge is on topics such as UV and effects on many physiological processes. UV radiation is typically immunosuppressive, yet increasing evidence suggests a protective role of UV radiation in autoimmune diseases, including Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This occurs via multiple signaling mechanisms, including local and systemic immunosuppression, the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), and suppression of melatonin secretion and subsequent T cell responses [

 <xref rid="B193-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Overall, it appears that UV radiation exerts immunomodulatory effects, primarily via suppression of helper T cell type-1 mediated responses thorough multiple mechanisms. This may be beneficial in specific circumstances, including autoimmune diseases, but requires further investigation in humans.
