<p>Acute exposure to pollutants and toxic substances can impair thermoregulatory responses [
 <xref rid="B166-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>], with chronic exposure resulting in a multitude of long-term health complications. Children are reported to spend significantly greater periods of time outdoors compared to adults, potentially increasing their likelihood for exposure to toxicants. It is widely recognized that high ambient temperatures increase the uptake of many pollutants and play a critical role in increasing toxicity [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>], which may be further compounded by exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Pollutants and toxins that alter metabolism, SkBF, and/or sweating responses may have a profound effect upon thermoregulation responses of both children and adults [
 <xref rid="B168-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. In rodents, an acute, protective hypothermia followed by a rebound, sustained hyperthermia is observed following dosing with many toxic substances, including insecticides. Humans do not typically experience the magnitude of hypothermia observed in rodents following toxicant exposure, although marked hypothermia has been observed in specific instances [
 <xref rid="B169-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. More common is a hyperthermic or fever response that may persist for several days after exposure to a toxic agent [

Based on increasing levels of pollution from vehicles, insecticide use, and byproducts from industry, an understanding of routes of absorption, toxicity, modulation of physiological responses, including temperature regulation, and long-term health effects is necessary. Increasing interest in the complex interplay among pollutants, mortality, and heat stress in older individuals is evident [
