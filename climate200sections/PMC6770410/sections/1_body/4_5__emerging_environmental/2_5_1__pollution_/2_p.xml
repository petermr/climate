<p>The WHO estimates the global cost resulting from pollution at 1.7 million children deaths per year [
 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. High ambient temperatures and airborne pollutants independently increase morbidity and mortality, but few studies have investigated the interplay between both stressors [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>,
 <xref rid="B173-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. A limited number of studies have attempted to do so, yielding mixed results. Several studies indicate an interaction effect, with pollution effects being greater on days with higher ambient temperature [
 <xref rid="B17-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whilst others found limited or no interaction [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Toxicity of air pollutants can be modified by atmospheric transformations, with greater primary pollutants forming toxic secondary products under conditions of higher temperature, greater sunlight exposure, and in the presence of copollutants [
 <xref rid="B174-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Considering predicted elevations of both stressors in the future, and limited current knowledge of how their interactions affect thermoregulation and overall health, further research is urgently needed. The physiological strain associated with exposure to high ambient temperatures may alter the physiological response to pollutants and other chemicals, increasing susceptibility to the negative health effects [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>,
 <xref rid="B173-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. A further plausible consideration is the deleterious cardiovascular and respiratory effects of airborne pollution that may lead to compromised thermoregulatory function both in children and later in life, raising health risks in an already vulnerable population during extreme heat exposure.
