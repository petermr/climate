<p>Understanding physiological responses to heat exposure is of increasing importance in the face of extraordinary environmental and climate change facing humans. In particular, emphasis should be placed on ‘at risk populations’, including children and infants, the elderly, and individuals with obesity and chronic pathologies, including cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. Many physiological differences exist between adults and children of varying developmental stages in their responses to exercise and exposure to environmental extremes, including morphological, endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and thermoregulatory responses. The classic notion that children possess inferior thermoregulatory capabilities and reduced thermal tolerance has been vigorously challenged over the past 25 years and may only hold true in extreme conditions. Of course, this is particularly relevant in light of global climate change where ‘extremes’ are more likely to be encountered, evidenced by patterns of increasing average global ambient temperatures, increased frequency and severity of heat waves, and increased pollution and UV exposure. The complex interplay between increasing environmental stressors should be carefully considered when coupled with concerning health statistics that negatively affect thermoregulation in children, including prevalence of inactivity, childhood obesity, and the earlier onset of preventable ‘adult’ diseases, including type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. The long-term impact of multiple environmental–physiological stressors, including heat, UV exposure, and pollution on physiological function in children, is not fully understood and warrants further investigation as a significant future global health challenge.</p>
