<p>The concept of children being classified as “at risk” of heat-related illness relates to increased vulnerability to the effects of heat stress, with increased morbidity or mortality versus a healthy adult reference population [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Epidemiological evidence is mixed but does indicate a distinct age-related variation in heat-related morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Age groups at greatest risk of health-related morbidity and mortality include older adults (≥75 years) and “young children” (0–4 years) [

 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Death rates are lowest among children aged 5–14 years at 0.1 per million, with considerably higher infant death rates at 4.2 per million, in part owing to infants and younger children being unable to operate locks or being restrained in vehicles, in which ambient temperature is exacerbated [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Between 17–74 years of age, a progressive, moderate increase in heat-related deaths occurs, with considerable increases with more advanced age (≥85 years, 12.8 deaths per million). Prediction models of weather-related deaths due to excessive natural heat exposure suggest an odds ratio of 4.4 in infants (&lt;1 year), 1.9 in young children (1–4) versus an odds ratio of 1.0 in the young adult reference population (25–34 years) [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Overall, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts child mortality related to heat exposure at &gt;100,000 deaths per year by 2050, with greatest climate change related mortality occurring in South Asia [
