<p>Isolated muscle power output has traditionally been assessed during force–velocity experiments, whereby muscle is activated to produce force while at constant length and then shortened at a constant velocity or at a constant force (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Caiozzo, 2002</xref>). Such controlled shortening actions are repeated numerous times on a muscle preparation to determine the relationship between force output and shortening velocity in that muscle. Power output is calculated as force generated multiplied by shortening velocity. During such force–velocity experiments, performance of skeletal muscle generally improves as temperature rises, with increases in estimates of maximum shortening velocity and power output (
