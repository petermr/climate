<p>Isolated skeletal muscle mechanics has often been determined using isometric studies, whereby the muscle is activated while kept at an overall constant length (

 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">James, 2013</xref>). However, at higher temperatures, this change in force is usually relatively low, and above the optimal temperature, a gradual reduction in force occurs (

For example, a comparison of maximum isometric force produced by single fibres from species of ectothermic fish from the Antarctic, North Sea, and Central Africa demonstrated that the muscle of each fish produced maximal force at temperatures around those that occurred in their natural environment, with decreases in force at lower and higher temperatures, such that each species outperformed the other species when in its own physiological temperature range (

Skeletal muscle in endotherms has also been found to show high thermal sensitivity of isometric force production outside of physiological temperature ranges, regardless of whether the muscle is from the body core, where temperature is relatively constant, or the periphery of the body, such as found in diaphragm (core) and soleus (peripheral) muscle isolated from laboratory mice,

As temperature rises, there is no change in the number of cross-bridges that form (myosin heads attached to actin binding sites) within skeletal muscle, but there is an increase in the proportion of cross-bridges that are in a high force producing state, thereby enhancing muscle force generation (
