<p>When a neurone stimulates a muscle cell, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle cytoplasm, increasing calcium concentration to initiate a chain of events that allow myosin to interact more strongly with actin (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004
 </xref>). Muscle force is produced via the interaction between myosin and actin, with myosin binding to actin to form cross-bridges that undergo a conformational change to produce force. These cross-bridges can be in low or high force–producing states (

When the neural stimulus ends, calcium is taken back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while parvalbumin also binds calcium in the cytoplasm and shuttles it to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing the concentration of calcium in the muscle cell; a reduction in calcium concentration decreases the number of interactions between myosin and actin, lowering muscle force to a ‘resting’ level (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000
 </xref>). Therefore, greater calcium concentration in the cytoplasm causes higher numbers of cross-bridges to form and greater force production, whereas more rapid calcium release into the cytoplasm leads to faster force generation and more rapid calcium uptake from the cytoplasm causes faster muscle relaxation.
