<p>In endotherms, there is evidence that some discrepancies in thermal sensitivity between skeletal muscles may relate to differences in location of each muscle in the body that result in variation in the range of temperature experienced. Skeletal muscle from the core of the body is maintained at a more narrow range of temperatures and has been found to have greater thermal sensitivity than muscle from the periphery in fish exhibiting regional endothermy (

 <italic>M. musculus</italic>, limb muscle (extensor digitorum longus) demonstrated that isometric force generation and relaxation times and maximal shortening velocity had lower thermal sensitivity, below core body temperature, in the bat wing muscle, which is likely to be subjected to much higher temperature ranges during flight than would occur in mouse limb muscle (

Therefore, it seems that muscles subjected to a more narrow range of temperatures, as would be expected in core body muscles in endotherms, can become specialized to produce higher mechanical performance over a narrow thermal range, while having higher thermal sensitivity, as predicted by theory of a generalist–specialist continuum (
