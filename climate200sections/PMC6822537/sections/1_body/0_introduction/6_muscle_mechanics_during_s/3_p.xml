<p>During isometric actions, temperature does not just affect the maximal amount of force produced. Rates of force generation and relaxation, during isometric activities, increase as temperature rises (

 </xref>). Data from both ectothermic and endothermic species indicate that the rate of change decreases as the optimal temperature for maximal mechanical performance of muscle is approached. Changes in rates of force generation and relaxation could have important influences on whole animal performance; in some species, they may influence the stride frequency that an animal can attain (

 </xref>; see discussion below on temperature effects on work loops). Increased temperature raises myofibrillar ATPase activity and the rate at which parvalbumin binds calcium, thereby increasing rates of isometric force generation and relaxation, respectively (
