<p>The present review has demonstrated that changes in temperature can have profound effects on the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle, in turn affecting locomotor performance, behaviour, and potential survival. In some species acclimation, dormancy or other behavioural responses could reduce or remove potential effects of climate change on performance; there are limits to the efficacy of such approaches to dealing with climate change and many species are unable to acclimate or undergo dormancy. It is clear that the effects of temperature on muscle physiology differ between species and in some cases between populations within a species, which adds further complexity to modelling potential effects of climate change on fitness and species distribution. For example, the capacity of mosquitofish (
 <italic>Gambusia holbrooki</italic>) to acclimate critical sustained swimming performance and skeletal muscle metabolic enzyme activities has been found to vary between populations, even between populations from the same lineage (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). However, some species from relatively stable thermal environments, such as the Antarctic fish 
 <italic>Pagothenia borchgrevinki</italic>, seem unable to acclimate burst locomotor performance in response to environmental temperature change (
 <xref rid="ref100" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001
 </xref>), although they are able to improve critical sustained swimming performance at higher temperatures via acclimation (
 <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Seebacher 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). While thermal acclimation incurs energetic costs, it can in some cases enable performance to be improved across a season and may facilitate some species to better buffer against thermal effects of climate change. In contrast, other species may also cope well with thermal effects of climate change by having relatively low thermal sensitivity, which although this can entail a relatively lower performance, it would be maintained over a wider temperature range.
