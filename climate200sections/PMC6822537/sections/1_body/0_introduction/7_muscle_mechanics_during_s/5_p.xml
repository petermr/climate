<p>The aetiology of fatigue is complex, is species and muscle specific, and is also temperature sensitive (

For example, skeletal muscle fatigue has, at least in part, been attributed to accumulation of inorganic phosphate and hydrogen ions, which have been shown to directly inhibit interactions between myosin and actin, during the cross-bridge cycle, and to indirectly cause lowered myofibrillar Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, such that less force is produced at a specific calcium concentration, and there is a reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> release (
