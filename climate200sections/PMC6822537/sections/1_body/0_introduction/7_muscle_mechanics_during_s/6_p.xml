<p>A further important aspect of fatigue is the mechanical efficiency of muscle activity, which has also been demonstrated to be temperature sensitive. Data by 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Edwards 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1972
 </xref>) indicated that increasing temperature reduced the mechanical efficiency of isometric contractions in human quadriceps muscle 
 <italic>in situ</italic>, such that higher temperatures elicited greater energy cost and more rapid fatigue while undertaking the same activity. However, it has been more recently demonstrated that temperature effects on mechanical efficacy can be related to contractile velocity and, more specifically, a rightward shift in the efficiency–velocity relationship, whereby low-velocity muscle action may be less efficient at higher temperatures due to an increased speed of cross-bridge cycling, and at higher temperature, mechanical efficacy increases (
