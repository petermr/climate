<p>Despite the outlined challenges with summarizing the current literature, it is likely that the effect of temperature on prolonged muscle activity is species specific. A disparity in subsequent locomotor performance between predator and prey as a result of changing temperature may affect the survival and abundance of a particular species. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2015
 </xref>) found that exposure to an elevated temperature influenced predator–prey interactions of two common reef fish. The piscivorous dottyback (
 <italic>Pseudochromis fuscus</italic>) demonstrated increased attack speed, while the planktivorous damselfish (
 <italic>Pomacentrus wardi</italic>) had decreased escape speeds and distances leading to increased predation rates. Other work has demonstrated that temperature effects on predator–prey relationships can, in some instances, also favour prey (
