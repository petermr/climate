<p>Interestingly, the previously outlined temperature-induced increase in fatigue resistance reported by 
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">James 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2012
 </xref>) did not translate to whole-organismal endurance in the same species, 
 <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, where jump performance was decreased either side of an optimal temperature (
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Herrel and Bonneaud, 2012</xref>). This may indicate that exertion capacity may be limited by factors external to the muscular contractile elements (
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Herrel and Bonneaud, 2012</xref>) or that the chosen fatigue protocol may not relate closely enough to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> locomotor demands of the whole organism. Studies using relatively long duration fatigue protocols may not accurately represent movements involved in feeding and burst locomotion, which are performed using single or small numbers of muscle activations (

 <xref rid="ref102" ref-type="bibr">Wilson 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002
 </xref>). Burst performance, which is the result of a small number of high-force muscle activations, has been documented to be important for performance (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Bennett, 1994</xref>) and survival (
 <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Watkins, 1996</xref>), so a reduction in phase one of the fatigue response with increasing temperature may be beneficial to some species in more burst like, shorter, periods of prolonged muscular activity.
