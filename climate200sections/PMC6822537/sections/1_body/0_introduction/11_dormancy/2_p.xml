<p>Aestivation for 3 months did not affect burst swimming performance of the green-striped burrowing frog, 
 <italic>Cyclorana alboguttata</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Hudson and Franklin, 2002</xref>). In addition, 9 months of aestivation in the green-striped burrowing frog did not cause any significant changes in the maximal power output or fatigue resistance of isolated iliofibularis or sartorius muscles during work loop studies (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>), despite significant reduction in the rate of tetanus force relaxation in iliofibularis muscle from aestivated individuals. Green-striped burrowing frogs are able to maintain skeletal muscle mass and cross-sectional area over these durations of dormancy (
