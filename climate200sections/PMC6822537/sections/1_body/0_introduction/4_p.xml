<p>Given that animal performance is influenced by the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle, this review will focus on the acute and chronic effects of temperature change on skeletal muscle mechanics and consider how such effects could influence animal behaviour and survival as a result of climate change. Skeletal muscle mechanics has been shown to constrain aspects of animal performance that are important in some behaviours, such as sprinting, as used during an escape response, and bite force, as would be used during some aggressive behaviours. For example, previous studies have found strong correlations between individual variation in skeletal muscle mechanics or activity of metabolic enzymes in muscle, as a proxy of muscle mechanics, and variation in maximal sprint performance within a lizard species (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Therefore, this review will also consider, where possible, how any temperature-induced alterations in muscle mechanics may impact locomotor performance and behaviour. Determining the existence of linkages between changes in skeletal muscle mechanics and effects on locomotor performance and behaviour is key to understanding the extent to which muscle mechanics could constrain locomotion and behaviour in a changing climate. Where possible, this review will differentiate between temperature effects on endotherms and ectotherms. Endotherms use heat from metabolism to regulate their core body temperature, often within a narrow range of temperatures, whereas the body temperature of ectotherms is dependent on their external environment and can undergo large daily and seasonal changes (
