<p>Acclimation responses occur in many species that are subjected to relatively large, seasonal changes in temperature and involve physiological changes to improve aspects of performance at the seasonal temperature. In many, but not all, cases acclimation responses can be beneficial, enabling changes in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes to effect seasonal compensation in performance, such as to improve the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle and consequently locomotor performance at relatively low temperatures (

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). For example, muscle power output increased with temperature in caudofemoralis (the main muscle to power swimming) isolated from saltwater crocodiles,

 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). However, cold-acclimated (20°C) individuals had a higher rate of caudofemoralis force generation and relaxation than those that were warm acclimated (30°C), enabling higher work loop power output in cold-acclimated muscle when tested at either acclimation temperature (
 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Seebacher and James, 2008</xref>). In this study, the thermal sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity of caudofemoralis muscle decreased with cold acclimation, providing at least some explanation for the results obtained (

 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Glanville and Seebacher (2006</xref>) found, in much smaller individuals of the same species, that cold acclimation (20°C) enabled individuals to achieve higher maximum sustained swimming performance (

 <sub>Crit</sub>) than warm-acclimated (30°C) individuals when tested at the cold acclimation temperature, the reverse being true at 30°C. Therefore, in the saltwater crocodile, the cold acclimation of skeletal muscle helps explain the compensation in swimming performance seen at lower temperatures in cold-acclimated animals. In another example, acclimation of red (slower, more aerobic) muscle mechanics and swimming performance was compared between rainbow smelt, 
 <italic>Osmerus mordax</italic>, and rainbow trout, 
 <italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, that tend to encounter relatively higher and lower ranges of temperature, respectively, over a year (
 <xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">Shuman and Coughlin, 2018</xref>). In both species, red muscle isolated from cold-acclimated individuals had faster rates of isometric force generation and relaxation than warm-acclimated individuals at the two test temperatures used, representing relatively cold and mid-range environmental temperatures, although this effect was greater in smelt (
 <xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">Shuman and Coughlin, 2018</xref>). In work loop studies, there was no significant effect of acclimation group on maximum skeletal muscle power output (
 <xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">Shuman and Coughlin, 2018</xref>). In both species, cold-acclimated fish showed higher maximum steady swimming speed, than warm-acclimated fish, at the mid-range test temperature, the difference between acclimation groups being much greater in smelt, the species that are subjected to a higher annual range in temperature (
