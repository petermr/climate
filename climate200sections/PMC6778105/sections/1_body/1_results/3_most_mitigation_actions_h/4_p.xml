<p id="Par24">Interventions to reduce food waste and animal products consumption have similar characteristics: limited number of studies with low between-study heterogeneity (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 21.6% and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 36.8% both ns), meaning that interventions targeting these behaviours tend to report statistically similar effects. Although the average magnitude of these effect sizes is higher compared to energy, transportation or water, these are marginally significant (food waste 
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.231 95% CI −0.518, 0.056 POB 16.3%, and animal products consumption
