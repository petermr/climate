<p id="Par22">Interventions targeting transportation, including less private car use and more public transportation, bicycle, and walking, have a combined POB of 9.6% (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.136 95% CI −0.183, −0.089). However, combining all interventions targeting transportation reveals highly heterogeneous estimates (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 98.4%) implying that very different effects are obtained for different types of transportation modes. Isolating the impact for decreasing private car use substantially reduces the POB to 2.5% with an effect size close to zero (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.036 95% CI −0.039, −0.034). This is a statistically precise estimate (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0%).
