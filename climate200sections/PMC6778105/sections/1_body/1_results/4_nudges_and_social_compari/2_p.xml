<p id="Par27">Appealing to the need for climate change mitigation or trying to increase people’s engagement (either by goal-setting or commitment to climate change mitigation) seem to produce higher average effect sizes (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.253 to 
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.266). Some caution is required, however, when interpreting these effects. Studies employing these strategies tend to be composed mostly of self-selected samples, which greatly inflates results. In particular, commitment strategies require, by definition, that people accept to commit to a goal, otherwise they are excluded from the study. Therefore, such average effect sizes are much higher (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.480; POB 33.9%) than strategies that target the general population, with various levels of commitment or interest in climate change mitigation. Moreover, between-study heterogeneity is high both in interventions using appeals and engagement (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 70.5% and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 71.8% respectively).
