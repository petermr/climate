<p id="Par29">Up to this point we have examined average effect sizes per different moderator but many features co-occur between studies, which increases uncertainty about the main influences of the effect. While subgroup analysis does not establish causal effects, we attempted to disentangle the potential role of different moderators using a meta-regression model jointly testing all covariates, including sample size, self-selection, type of behaviour and type of intervention. The model [

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01] showed that sample size, the interventions social comparison and nudges, and the behaviour recycling were the covariates explaining significant variations in the effect sizes. In Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> we explore sample size per behaviour and intervention. Energy, transportation and water were the only behaviours examined in very large studies which may explain the lowest effect sizes found (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Per intervention, nudges were a strategy only tested in small sample studies, which in turn may be related to its high effect size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
