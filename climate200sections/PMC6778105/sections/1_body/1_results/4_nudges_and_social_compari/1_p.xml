<p id="Par26">Information and social comparison are the most common strategies used in field experiments, both in terms of the number of studies published as well as the quantity of people reached. However, both show a very small impact. Information-based strategies (e.g., statistics, in-home displays, factual feedback, energy labels) has an expected POB of 3.4% (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.048 95% CI −0.075, −0.021). Strategies of social comparison, such as providing social references and peer comparisons, are slightly more effective (
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.077 95% CI −0.108, −0.046; POB = 5.4%). Nonetheless, both estimates are based on the largest RCTs included in our sample, suggesting that consistent (small) effects can be expected using these strategies, albeit seemingly more consistent when using information than social comparison (
