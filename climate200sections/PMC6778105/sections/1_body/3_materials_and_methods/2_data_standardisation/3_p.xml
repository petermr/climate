<p id="Par52">The procedure was as follows: for each individual paper in our sample, we extracted their reported outcomes—typically reported as 
 <italic>t</italic>-test, regression coefficients + SE, means + SDs, percentages, etc. We inputted these estimates plus the sample size for each individual study in the calculator. The calculator then returns an estimate for Cohen’s 
 <italic>d</italic>, its variance and the 95% CI. These are then the estimates transferred to STATA to perform the meta-analysis. We present the sample sizes per condition in the columns N_EG (sample size for the experimental group) and N_CG (sample size for the control group) in the STATA database (Supplementary Data
