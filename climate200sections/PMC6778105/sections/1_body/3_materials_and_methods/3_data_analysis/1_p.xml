<p id="Par53">We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, pooling study-level data using STATA IC14 (

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup> (These analyses can be replicated in R using metagen or rma (see “Code availability” statement below)). We used the most common approach to modelling between-study variance, the DerSimonian–Laird (DL) model. 
 <italic>Metaan dl</italic> assumes that the true effect can be different for each study and that the individual-study effects are distributed with a variance 
 <italic>Τ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> around an overall true effect. Summary estimates are reported with 95% CIs and stratified by different interventions. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with the 
 <italic>I</italic>² statistic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, which describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. It is an intuitive and simple expression of the inconsistency of studies’ results. A confidence interval for 
 <italic>I</italic>² is constructed by 
 <italic>metaan</italic> using the iterative non-central chi-squared distribution method of Hedges and Piggott (2001) described in
