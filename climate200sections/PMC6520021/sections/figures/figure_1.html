 <caption> Climate warming across Europe and geographic locations of the pollination networks. Color codes the predicted increase in maximum temperature of the warmest month between 2020 and 2080 (one of the five variables considered in the species distribution models used here). The warmer the color, the higher the increase in temperature between these time horizons. The points indicate the location of the seven networks, which are plotted in the insets with green and orange nodes representing plant and insect species, respectively. The different colors of the dots serve to identify each network in the following figures. The two darker colors in the South indicate the two Mediterranean networks, while the rest belong to the Eurosiberian region. </caption>
