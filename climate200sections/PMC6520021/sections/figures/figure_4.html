 <caption> The pruning of plantsâ€™ phylogenetic and functional trees through extinctions and subsequent coextinctions. Phylogenetic tree ( A) and functional similarity dendrogram ( B) of all plant species of the seven pollination networks. The inner color bar circle represents the probability of direct, climatically induced extinction. The outer circle, in turn, represents the overall probability of being driven to extinction by either climate or the subsequent coextinction cascades. Time horizon is 2080. Details of the simulations are the same as in Figs. 1 to 3. The total number of plant species is 244, and the extinction and coextinction probabilities are the average of 1000 replicates. </caption>
