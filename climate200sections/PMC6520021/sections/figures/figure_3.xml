  <title>Coextinctions may target different plant species than climatically induced primary extinctions.</title>
  <p>The figure shows the probability of coextinction for each plant species at each network versus its probability of being climatically driven to extinction at time horizon 2080. Species toward the right of the red 
   <italic>x</italic> = 
   <italic>y</italic> isocline show a higher vulnerability to climate, while those toward the left are more susceptible to the loss of biotic interactions. Details of the simulations are the same as in
