 <caption> Plant vulnerability across orders and functional groups. The figure shows the ranking of plant orders ( A) and functional groups ( B) to the overall risk of extinction and subsequent coextinctions for time horizon 2080. Figure represents the average and SD across 1000 replicates of climatically induced extinctions (gray) and those plus subsequent coextinctions (black). The different functional groups are as follows: group 1, open flowers, not clonal, wind dispersed; group 2, closed flowers, not clonal, wind dispersed; group 3, open flowers, not clonal, animal dispersed; group 4, open flowers, clonal, animal dispersed; group 5, closed flowers, not clonal, yellow, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 6, closed flowers, not clonal, other colors, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 7, open flowers, clonal, geophytes, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 8, open flowers, not clonal, therophytes, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 9, open flowers, not clonal, chamaerophytes, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 10, open flowers, not clonal, geophytes, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 11, closed flowers, clonal, hemicryptophytes, neither animal nor wind dispersed; group 12, closed flowers, clonal, hemicryptophytes, wind dispersed; group 13, open flowers, clonal, hemicryptophytes; group 14, open flowers, not clonal, hemicryptophytes; group 15, closed flowers, clonal, geophytes; group 16, open flowers, clonal, chamaephytes. </caption>
