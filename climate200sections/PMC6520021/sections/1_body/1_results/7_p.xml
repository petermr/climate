<p>Because coextinctions target different phylogenetic and functional groups and given the fact that we observe a highly significant phylogenetic signal across all functional traits (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 in all cases), one could conclude that the functional dendrogram (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) merely depicts phylogenetic relationships (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In line with this, the effect of locality and network identity on coextinction probabilities based on functional similarity is qualitatively identical to analyses including phylogeny (tables S5 and S6). However, a cophenetic correlation (
 <italic>c</italic> = 0.045, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.040) and a Mantel test (Spearman 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.052, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) indicate a very weak albeit significant association between these descriptors. Therefore, our incorporation of plantsâ€™ functional traits provides additional information to that provided by the phylogeny (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>21</italic>
 </xref>).
