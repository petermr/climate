<p>As for the case of taxonomic groups, the combined effects of extinctions and subsequent coextinctions can target different functional groups and therefore have contrasting effects on the functioning of local communities and their ability to cope with further environmental change (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). One example is functional group 10 constituted by plant species that have open flowers, are not clonal, have an underground storage organ (geophytes), and are neither animal nor wind dispersed. Another example is group 15 constituted by plant species showing open flowers, clonal reproduction, and perennating buds at the soil surface (hemicryptophytes). This group has an almost null probability to be climatically driven to extinction but a probability close to 0.3 to disappearing through subsequent coextinctions (
