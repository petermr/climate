<p>Once we have described the rate of species lost and the differential predictors of both climatically induced extinctions and those extinctions plus subsequent coextinctions, we next partition the vulnerability to each of these two processes across plant species. Quite a large fraction of plant species that have a low probability of becoming extinct through climate change show a high probability of being driven to coextinction (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This means that the effect of species interactions and their induced coextinctions is not only increasing the number of species disappearing but also inducing a bias in the identity of those species. This may result in a different pruning of the phylogenetic and functional trees than the one resulting from merely climatically induced extinctions (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Specifically, plant orders with a higher probability of disappearing by 2080 through the combined effects of extinction and coextinction include Malvales, Dipsacales, Santalales, Oxalidales, and Asparagales, represented in the networks by 16, 5, 3, 1, and 25 species, respectively (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In line with this, although there is no phylogenetic signal in the overall pattern of plant coextinctions when looking simultaneously at all the networks (table S5), there is a phylogenetic signal in four of the networks when analyzed separately in 2050; this signal, however, remains significant in only one of the networks by 2080 (fig. S7), which would suggest that our ability to predict the vulnerability of species to climate change based on phylogenetic information decreases with the length of the temporal horizon.
