 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the fraction of plant species lost through the two time horizons for each of the seven pollinator networks. Each panel compares the direct loss of species induced by climate versus the same amount plus the subsequent coextinction cascades for 2050 and 2080. The difference between both amounts (the slope of the lines in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), therefore, shows how many more species are predicted to be lost, as one takes into account their mutual dependencies.
