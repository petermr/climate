<p>We collected geographic distribution data for the 244 distinct plant species of the seven pollinator networks (see Materials and Methods and database S1). Subsequently, we considered the projected climatic conditions for time horizons 2050 and 2080 [through the main text and figures, we are considering the A1b socioeconomic scenario (SRES) using the RCA30 regional climate model (RCM) driven by the ECHAM5 global circulation model (GCM) and ensembles of six different species distribution models (see Materials and Methods). However, we have also explored other scenarios and combinations (see Materials and Methods) with qualitatively similar results (figs. S3 and S4 and tables S1 and S2).] (see Materials and Methods, 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, and fig. S5). For each time horizon, we ran species distribution models to assign climatic suitability to each plant species at each one of the seven locations where it is present. From this information, we estimate an extinction probability based on the degree to which the predicted future local climate at the network location is similar to the plantâ€™s climatic range, measured across its current Euro-Mediterranean distribution (see Materials and Methods and database S2). At this stage, several plant species may have gone locally extinct due to the direct effects of climate change. As a consequence, their interactions in the pollination network are no longer present. Since a species experiencing a reduction in the number of partners it depends on may have reduced fitness, we further imposed a probability of coextinction as follows. Each plant and animal species that has faced a reduction on its number of partners is assigned a coextinction probability proportional to the fraction of interactions lost [for three of the networks containing weighted information, we estimated a weighted version of the coextinction probability, which is proportional to the sum of strengths of the interactions lost. Overall, both measures of coextinction probability were significantly correlated (see Materials and Methods and fig. S6)]. We assume that those species left without any resource will go locally extinct. This procedure is repeated recursively so that coextinctions cascade through the network until no more species are affected, independently for each time horizon. This enables us to disentangle the direct impact of climate change on extinction rates versus the indirect effects mediated by the depletion of biotic interactions. We keep track of the identity of the plant species that go extinct, so we can later on assess to what degree the extant species represent a biased sample of the original communities (i.e., before the climatically induced extinctions).
