<p>Our study is based on a dataset of seven European pollinator networks compiled from the web-of-life dataset (see Materials and Methods), for which phylogenetic relationships (figs. S1 and S2) and information about plantsâ€™ functional traits (database S1) were gathered from various sources. Specifically, the seven networks belong to Mediterranean (

 </xref>) and Eurosiberian (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>) biogeographic regions (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), ranging from 52 to 797 species (plants and pollinators), and contain information about the following plant traits: clonal reproduction (yes/no), seed dispersal (wind/animal/others), flower shape limits pollen exchange by animals (yes/no), seven classes of flower color, and five types of Raunkiaer life-form (see Materials and Methods and database S1). These are functional traits central to plant life history. For example, the seed bank may allow a species to persist across unfavorable years, seed dispersal may allow colonizing distant habitats, and floral shape may condition the degree of dependence on pollinators.
