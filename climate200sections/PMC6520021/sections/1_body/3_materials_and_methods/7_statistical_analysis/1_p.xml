<p>The phylogenetic and functional structure of extinction and coextinction patterns were analyzed with generalized linear models. We included the phylogenetic or functional correlation matrix with off-diagonals multiplied by a parameter Î», which fitted to the residual distribution of the model and quantified the strength of association between related or functionally similar species (

 </xref>). We compared three models. The first model included only the intercept, the second model also added spatial information embedded in the latitude, longitude, and the interaction, and the third model also included network identity as a categorical factor. We then used Akaike weights to estimate the relative evidence favoring each model.
