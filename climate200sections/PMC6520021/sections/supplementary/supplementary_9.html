 <p>Fig. S1. Plant phylogeny showing the plant species represented in the seven networks analyzed in this paper.</p>
 <p>Fig. S2. Same as in fig. S1 but showing plant species at each of the seven networks.</p>
 <p>Fig. S3. Boxplots showing the upper and lower extremes, quartiles, medians, and outliers of the probabilities of extinction of all species of each network for 2050 according to different RCM/GCM/SRES scenarios.</p>
 <p>Fig. S4. Same as in fig. S3 but for 2080.</p>
 <p>Fig. S5. Principal components analysis representing expected changes in climatic conditions at the locations of the seven pollination networks.</p>
 <p>Fig. S6. Correlation between the probability of plant coextinction estimated as the fraction of interactions lost ( 
  <i>x</i> axis; approach in the main text) and the equivalent figure estimated as the fraction of total interaction strength lost ( 
  <i>y</i> axis).
