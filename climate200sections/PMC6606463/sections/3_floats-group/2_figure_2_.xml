 <caption>
  <p>(
   <italic>a</italic>,
   <italic>b</italic>) Representation of two populations living in variable and stable thermal environments, respectively. Solid and dashed blue lines illustrate the mean and maximum and minimum temperatures over time in the absence of warming. Black solid line and red shaded area illustrate mean temperature and the thermal range over time with warming in a variable and stable thermal environment. Under equal rates of warming, mean temperatures fall within the historical range of experienced conditions (i.e. between the blue dashed lines) for organisms living in the variable climate, but exceed historical temperatures experienced by the stable climate. However, when climatic extremes are considered, future extreme temperatures will exceed historical limits in both variable and stable environments.
