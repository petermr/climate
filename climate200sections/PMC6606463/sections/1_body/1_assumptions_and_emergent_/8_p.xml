<p>Our analysis is based on the upper thermal limits from a single experimental population from multiple species, and therefore suggests broad-taxonomic patterns in adaptive capacity between species, rather than specific case studies of local adaptation within species. Thermal limits from multiple populations of each species would need to be tested to validate these patterns and disentangle the environmental drivers of thermal sensitivity. Nevertheless, the empirical TSM wedge generates interesting hypotheses about the potential mismatches in adaptive capacity between different taxonomic groups, and highlights the wedge of thermal sensitivity species may experience. In the following sections, we will discuss the potential biological drivers of these patterns and how spatial and temporal context influences population-level patterns of thermal sensitivity.</p>
