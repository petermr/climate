Species-level studies tend to rely on the thermal tolerance profiles from a single case study per species, usually corresponding to individuals from a single population and location. When single measures of a species' thermal limits are related to either local environmental temperatures or the global distribution of a species, implicit assumptions are being made about the thermal niche of that species, which can be broadly classified into two groups: (1) studies that link single measures of the fundamental thermal niche to a species distribution (i.e. realized thermal niche) often tacitly imply thermal niche conservatism among intraspecific populations (e.g. [
