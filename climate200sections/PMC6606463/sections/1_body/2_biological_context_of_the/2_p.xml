<p>Our analysis suggests that taxonomic differences in thermal sensitivity may exist within marine communities, particularly between primary producers and higher trophic levels, which correspond to a spectrum of thermal adaptive capacity. Indeed, the high frequency of benthic seaweeds in the locally adapted portion of the wedge is consistent with a previous review that found 90% of studies on marine macrophytes displayed population-level variation in upper thermal limits [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Sensitivity spectrums can vary in breadth between species depending on their evolutionary and ecological histories or biological traits. For example, species that have evolved across spatially broad or seasonally variable thermal ranges may display a steep sensitivity wedge, whereby cool-edge populations live far below their species-specific limit. By contrast, species that have evolved under a narrow thermal range (e.g. Antarctic ectotherms [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) or display high levels of local thermal adaptation (e.g. due to strong selection gradient, or low gene flow) may display a shallow sensitivity wedge, with limited capacity to absorb warming, irrespective of their range position. While no structured differences in thermal niche breadth were observed between phyla, seaweeds differ from many vertebrate and invertebrate animals in terms of biological traits (e.g mobility, dispersal) and their response to environmental drivers (e.g. light requirements), which may influence their adaptive capacity. Reproductive mode and the dispersal distance of propagules, for example, may influence population connectivity and the establishment of either locally adapted or conserved thermal niches between populations. Species with highly dispersive reproductive modes may have higher gene flow among populations, resulting in less adaptive divergence (i.e. gene swamping) and increasing the likelihood of thermal niche conservation among populations [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Conversely, low dispersal and limited gene flow among populations may promote the selection of genotypes that are best suited to local conditions [

 <italic>Scytothalia dorycarpa</italic>, a canopy-forming seaweed from southern Australia, provides an example of this. 
 <italic>Scytothalia</italic> displays strong patterns of local adaptation in its upper thermal limits along a latitudinal climate gradient [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that is thought to be driven, in part, by limited gene flow between populations as a result of its large propagule size and a negatively buoyant thallus [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. By contrast, many invertebrate and vertebrate species produce motile larvae with long pelagic larval phases which can facilitate gene flow, thereby helping to homogenize thermal limits between populations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Long-distance dispersal can also occur in seaweeds [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and is not ubiquitous within marine animals.
