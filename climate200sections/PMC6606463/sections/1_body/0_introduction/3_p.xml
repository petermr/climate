<p>Extensive experimental work has uncovered the mechanisms underpinning how temperature shapes and limits physiological performance, from genomic and biochemical processes to cellular and whole organism function (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). The shapes of thermal performance windows display remarkable similarity across taxa [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and have helped build a strong understanding of how climate change impacts the physiology and ecology of plants and animals [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At the same time, variation in the breadth and absolute limits of thermal niches across space and time generates an enormous diversity of potential thermal sensitivity scenarios among individuals within a species range. The aggregate effects of individual variation in thermal performance can have important implications for population-level vulnerability to warming [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and short-term extreme events (e.g. marine heatwaves [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Yet, when applied to broad spatial scales [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or multi-species assessments of warming vulnerability [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], within-species variation in thermal physiology is often overlooked [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and instead a single ‘species-level’ thermal niche is often inferred from realized thermal distributions [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or empirical measurements of the fundamental thermal niche from a single experimental population [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, implicit assumptions about how species' thermal niches may differ (or not) at the population level are often made despite remaining largely untested.
