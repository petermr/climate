<p>The aim of this review is, therefore, to look at the effects of within-species variation in thermal limits on the sensitivity of marine organisms. Phenotypic plasticity of individuals (i.e. the ability of an individual genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to the environment) and local adaptation within a population (i.e. selection on genetic variation causing a shift of the average phenotype within a population toward a local optimum) both cause within-species variation in thermal limits at different spatio-temporal scales. We integrate local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity into current ecological theory to address the implications that assumptions about population-level variation in the thermal niche of a species can have for warming vulnerability [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, using the available literature, we synthesize how thermal sensitivity varies across marine speciesâ€™ distributions and identify broad-taxonomic differences in the thermal sensitivity and adaptive capacity between phyla. We use these taxonomic differences to highlight the spectrum of thermal sensitivities that can occur 
 <italic>between-species</italic> within marine communities and discuss the spatial, temporal and biological context under which 
 <italic>within-species</italic> variation in thermal physiology may manifest and influence an individual and population vulnerability to climate warming.
