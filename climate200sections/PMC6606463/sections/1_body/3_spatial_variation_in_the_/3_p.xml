<p>In marine systems, upper and lower thermal limits are thought to be more closely coupled as a result of oxygen limitation on physiological functioning, such that a change in thermal limits at one end of a species thermal tolerance breadth is associated with a change at the other. Also, with the exception of changes in depth distribution [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], marine organisms generally have a limited ability to modify or seek refuge from their ambient thermal environment [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], arguably placing a greater selection pressure on the upper thermal limits of marine compared with terrestrial organisms. Moreover, latitudinal patterns in climatic variability are subject to major regional anomalies in the ocean, particularly in polar regions, and the temperate Southern Hemisphere, thereby calling for a re-evaluation of expectations from the CVH. For example, the pattern of increasing thermal tolerance breadth of an organism with increasing latitude does not apply to marine polar organisms, as the ambient thermal range is constrained by the freezing point of seawater (around −2°C) and the high thermal capacity of seawater (maximum temperatures in polar waters around 8°C). While many marine organisms survive under ice cover, temperatures beneath the ice remain stable, thereby reducing the scope for extreme cold hardiness as observed in some terrestrial organisms [

Moreover, while low-latitude tropical regions (i.e. ±10° of Equator) generally have stable climates, mid-latitudinal regions are often composed of a mosaic of thermal variabilities, with some regions displaying low variability and others high-temperature variability, particularly in coastal regions, where tidal regimes, currents, upwelling and bathymetry can all have a strong influence on local thermal regimes [

Across latitudinal clines on both the eastern and western coastlines of Australia (10–40°S), for example, seasonal climate variability remains relatively low, largely owing to strong poleward-flowing boundary currents. Also, across longitudinal clines within temperate latitudes, large differences in seasonal climate variability can be observed, particularly between the eastern (18.3 ± 3.1°C yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) and western (4.4 ± 1.5°C yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) coastlines of the United States, and between the Atlantic (5.6 ± 1.4°C yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) and Mediterranean (12.6 ± 1.0°C yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) coastlines of southern Europe. An extreme case of thermal variability is found in the Arabian Gulf, where marine organisms, which include many species shared with the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, may experience seasonal thermal ranges above 20°C within individual locations [

Therefore, while temperature variability may place a strong selection pressure on the thermal niche of marine organisms, its influence may need to be considered in a more regional, rather than latitudinal, context in the ocean. This could have strong implications for the thermal sensitivity of marine organisms, whose distributions may span across regions of high and low thermal variability.
