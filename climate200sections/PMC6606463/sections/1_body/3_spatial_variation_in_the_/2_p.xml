<p>The relationship between an organism's fundamental thermal niche and the environmental temperature regime that it experiences provides a strong foundation to examine the expected spatial variability of the thermal niche [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) posits that there is a positive relationship between an organism's thermal tolerance breadth and the level of climatic variability it experiences with increasing latitude [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While originally proposed as an explanation for Rappaports rule [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], more recently the CVH has been used to explain the climate change vulnerability of species at different latitudes, leading to the idea that high-latitude species will be more resistant to warming owing to their broader thermal niches and larger TSM compared with tropical species [
