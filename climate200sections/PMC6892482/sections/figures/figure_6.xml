 <caption>
  <title>Site numbers for the regions Iberia (north), Iberia (south) and Morocco per techno-complex Solutrean, Magdalenian, Early and Late Iberomaurusian.</title>
  <p>Category “Iberomaurusian”: the attribution to the Iberomaurusian is clear, but the period (Early or Late) is unknown due to lack of dating. As many sites were occupied during multiple techno-complexes, the sum of the site numbers in the data table do not add up to the total site numbers.</p>
