<p>Concerning Morocco, a strong decrease of site numbers after the Middle Palaeolithic resulting in a settlement gap is also evident. A very slow increase of site numbers begins only in the LGM [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, we analyse the distribution of Iberomaurusian sites and the resulting patterns of land use in the LGM and the Late Glacial. Our main objective is to study, for the first time, similarities and differences in human response to climate changes on a broad scale on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar during the LGM and the Late Glacial. We assume that the location of archaeological sites in our study area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g001">Fig 1</xref>), including caves, rock shelters and open-air sites, is not random, but reflects a preferential choice for habitats related to the presence of critical resources such as prey, water, raw material for lithic production and availability of shelter [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], many Solutrean and Magdalenian sites on the IP are found in the modern-day humid ombrotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In contrast, sites in the large and currently dry areas in the central and southern parts of Iberia are underrepresented. Next to the humid North of Iberia, the south-eastern coast of Spain and Portugal north of Lisbon evidence comparatively high site numbers. Very few sites were detected in the interior of the IP, a region probably abandoned in the early Upper Palaeolithic. Repopulation proceeded only slowly during the Late Gravettian, the Solutrean and the Magdalenian [
