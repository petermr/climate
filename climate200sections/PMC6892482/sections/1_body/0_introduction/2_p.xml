<p>In the Westernmost Mediterranean, there is a long research history of Palaeolithic sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that is accompanied by a rich palaeoclimate record from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea as well as from terrestrial geo-archives [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition to this, the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and Morocco are known for their high bioclimatic diversity, from hyperoceanic temperate bioclimates in the Cantabrian Mountains to the hyperdesertic tropical climate at the northern fringe of the Sahara [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the Mediterranean climate today is highly seasonal in temperature and precipitation. Reconstruction of Holocene Rapid Climate Change shows evidence of a complex forcing of seasonal differences, leading to climate instability and vulnerability [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This combination of archaeological and palaeoclimatological data makes this area an ideal test case for the study of hunter-gatherer behaviour in relation to environmental changes.
