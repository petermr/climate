<p>Stability of the mating networks was analysed by determining the maximum viable travel distance to neighbouring bands and testing if each minimum band had enough neighbours to form a sustainable network. This maximum distance was conceived as the travel distance the bands would have to make under the worst possible conditions of hunter-gatherer adaptations presented by Stein Mandryk [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], the underlying assumption being that travel over these distances would be too costly and lead to a minimum band breaking off to form another network or dying out if no other groups were available [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A maximum travel distance of 214.8 km was calculated after the same fashion as Stein Mandrykâ€™s maximum distance of 300 km (citing [

 <sup>2</sup> would need 11 neighbouring bands to sustain a mating network with no mating restrictions; the distance between the two most marginal bands in an optimally packed hexagonal network is 214.8 km. A minimum band of 25 members is considered part of a sustainable network if it has 6 neighbouring bands in a radius of 214.8km, implying open networks and no mating restrictions.
