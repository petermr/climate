<p>To apply the model to our dataset, we overlaid our sites with different sized hexagonal patterns to simulate inhabitants of archaeological sites forming minimum bands with different range sizes. The functionality of a network is based on having access to enough people in a certain range, meaning that an increase in population density (and a subsequent decrease in range size) should increase the stability of a mating network at least to the point when population growth leads to resource shortage. To assess the social stability of our four archaeological techno-complexes, we simulated networks with steadily increasing artificial population densities (0.01, 0.025, and 0.05 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>, derived from [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and corresponding decreasing range sizes to define the threshold at which these networks would be sustainable. If the networks are not sustainable at low population densities, they would be more susceptible to breakdown through external influences.
