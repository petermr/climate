<p>We overlaid our sites with three different hexagonal patterns, the size of the hexagons corresponding to ranges of 25 people inhabiting an area at 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>. A buffer with a radius of 214.8km was drawn around the centre point of each of these ranges, and the number of neighbours was tallied. If this number exceeded 6, the range was deemed sustainable.
