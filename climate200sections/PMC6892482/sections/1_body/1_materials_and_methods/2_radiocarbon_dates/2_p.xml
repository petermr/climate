<p>A first presupposition to use dates-as-data is the validation of the radiocarbon dates. This concerns both the archaeological validity, i.e. the stratigraphic integrity, as well as the methodological validity, concerning the quality of the 14C measurement itself. Hence, our data underwent a strict quality protocol. We excluded all dates with unclear methodology, bad preservation of bone collagen, sample contamination resulting in a rejuvenated date, and dates from rock art, as these samples lack stratigraphical context. In addition, we removed all dates with a standard deviation greater than 350 years to ensure a high precision of our analysis. As previously established, single dates from Iberomaurusian sites with unclear stratigraphic sequences, but with a clear association with the cultural material were kept in the database. The exclusive use of confirmed dates should guarantee a minimum level of reliability of the emerging patterns.</p>
