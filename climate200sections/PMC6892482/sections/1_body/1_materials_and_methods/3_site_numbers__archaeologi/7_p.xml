<p>The resulting overall density not only gives a first impression of site distribution, but likewise yields average distances between sites, which can be used to characterize and compare mobility. However, the NNA only analyses the pattern on one scale; in order to analyse site density on multiple scales, we also apply Ripley’s K analysis to our dataset [

We undertook the analysis with 100 distance bands, using identical study areas for each region (see Archaeological records and geographical setting), and plotted the difference function between the observed and expected patterns L(d)obs–L(d)exp [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Positive values indicate clustering; negative values indicate dispersal. The calculation was undertaken in ArcGIS 10.3 with a 99% confidence envelope. This method quantifiably analyses site pattern in such a way that we can compare the results between times frames in one region.
