<p>After the statistical site density analyses, we turn to the location of the sites in the landscape. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a tool often used in archaeological studies to visualize and interpret site clusters [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Here, a probability function in the form of a “hill” is placed over each data point, i.e. each site, and values are summed where the individual functions overlap (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] for a detailed methodological description). This can be used to identify clusters [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], define cluster attribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and even as a basis for population density estimates [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. We apply the approach presented by Grove [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], who uses the KDE as a method to display human spatial behaviour.
