<p>Grove follows Isaac [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] in acknowledging that the archaeological record is comprised of merely remnants of prehistoric activity, and there is a certain possibility that this activity continued outside of the vicinity of a single site. We can therefore use the KDE not only to localize clusters, but to visualize the intensity in which areas between sites were traversed. To calculate the KDE in a way that reflects land use intensity by travelling between sites, we follow Schmidt et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in using the mean Nearest Neighbour Distances from the previous NNA analysis as the bandwidth for the quartic kernel, and weighting the sites according to their archaeological composition, i.e. multi- (weight of 2) or single-layered (weight of 1). A comparison of this use intensity model in all three regions and two different time slices allows us to identify differences in land use patterns of Western Mediterranean hunter-gatherer groups.
