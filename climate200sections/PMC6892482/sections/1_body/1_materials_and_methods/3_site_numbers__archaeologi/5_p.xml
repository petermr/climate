<p>Site density analyses can be applied in a similar way to the reconstruction of Palaeolithic settlement patterns. Morgan [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have shown how site distribution reflects settlement pattern and mobility. In addition to this, this data can be used to characterize structural properties of the environment, assuming that the location of archaeological sites is broadly related to the distribution of resources the groups utilize [
