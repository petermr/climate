<p>In a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we took the number of sites as proxy for human presence in the Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic of Iberia, assuming that changes in site numbers and densities reflect either changes in mobility and/or population density. Site numbers per techno-complex are therefore presented here and analysed in a similar fashion. In addition to this, we utilize the archaeological composition of a siteâ€™s stratigraphy as a proxy for land use. Archaeological layers are palimpsests of human presence in a site. Sites with multiple layers represent repeated occupations over a longer period of time, while single-layered sites are interpreted as remnants of time-constrained, ephemeral human presence in the landscape. While we agree that the number of stratigraphic units is linked to settlement intensity, these sites are also part of a larger land use system. In contrast to ephemerally occupied places, the diachronic re-use of a site indicates its constant importance in the land use system and may reflect structural properties of the environment [
