<p>The NNA analyses site density by measuring distances between sites and their closest neighbouring site [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Mean distances are calculated and compared to the mean distances of a random pattern spanning the same study area [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. If the Nearest Neighbour Ratio is smaller than 1, the site distribution is clustered, if larger, dispersed, and statistical significance is given by the z-score and the p-value in ArcGIS 10.3.
