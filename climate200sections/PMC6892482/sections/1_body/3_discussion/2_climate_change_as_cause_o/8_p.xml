<p>In Morocco, after a gap in human occupation following the end of Middle Palaeolithic, radiocarbon data increases steadily from the LGM into HS 1. From a very low presence of humans in the LGM, stable clusters seem to have developed in the course of the Early Iberomaurusian. After HS 1, however, this region, like the Iberian regions, evidences a simultaneous peak phase in the radiocarbon record which is matched by site numbers and an expansion of settlement areas. Modern ombrotype distributions show more semiarid and dry conditions than Southern Iberia, but the palaeoclimate data record is very sparse and, so far, does not support the notion of a more critical environmental situation in Morocco. An unmodified transference of HS 1 climate simulation from Southern Iberia to Northern Morocco would probably result in even stronger aridity-indexes, but further research is required to clarify this topic.</p>
