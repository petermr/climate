<p>The radiocarbon curves for Southern Iberia and Northern Morocco closely trace climate oscillations from HS 2 until the Younger Dryas. Therefore, the question arises whether climate conditions were the main factor behind diachronic changes in Palaeolithic land use and settlement pattern in the Western Mediterranean. Several terrestrial and marine geological archives yielded detailed and chronologically well-constrained palaeoclimate proxy records [
