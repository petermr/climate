<p>Although a long tradition deals with cost-benefit ratios of hunter-gatherer subsistence, it remains difficult to define thresholds at which environmental constraints become too risky for human occupation and hunter-gatherer resilience collapses [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Such breakdowns of hunter-gatherer populations are clearly documented during the LGM in Central Europe, when large areas turned out to be high risk environments and were abandoned by humans [
