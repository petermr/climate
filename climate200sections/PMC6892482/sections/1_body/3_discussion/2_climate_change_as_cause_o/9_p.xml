<p>Compared to the Early Iberomaurusian and the Magdalenian, a marked difference in human adaptation during the Late Iberomaurusian can be identified. After HS1, groups in Morocco heavily exploited land snails as a food resource. Although this has so far only been studied in detail for the Neolithic [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], exploitation begins in the Late Iberomaurusian, after HS 1. The huge number of snail shells in living sites form thick occupation layers, sometimes towering several meters. This is not reported from Southern Iberia, although land snails are abundant there as well. Integrating land snails into the diet could have been the Late Iberomaurusian groups answer to difficult environmental conditions, which need to be addressed in future research.
