<p>HS 1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was probably much drier and colder than the LGM, as indicated by maxima of the cold-water foraminifer 
 <italic>Neoglobigerina pachyderma (s)</italic> and in ice rafted debris (IRD), concomitant minima in reconstructed sea surface temperatures (SST), e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] show a tripartite pattern with a peak in continental dryness during the second phase between about 17.1 and 16.3 ka. This roughly 800 year-long phase of maximum dryness is not well recorded in terrestrial archives, however, possibly due to problems in resolution and chronological dating. The Greenland Interstadial 1, a phase of climate amelioration, is well represented in pollen spectra, reconstructed SST and other climate proxies. At Padul, it is characterized by a clear spread of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> type pollen and a reduction in 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, a regional climatic pattern, which is closely mirrored in the MD95-2043 core. After GI-1, the climate got dryer and colder during the Younger Dryas, clearly reflected by multiple records covering the Late Glacial/Holocene transition in northern and southern Spain. The general picture of cold and arid climatic conditions during HS 2, HS 1, and the Younger Dryas (YD), interrupted by comparatively moist phases of the LGM and GI-1, is also reflected in proxy data for Northern Iberia [
