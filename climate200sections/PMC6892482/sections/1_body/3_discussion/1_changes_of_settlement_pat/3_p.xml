<p>The situation changes significantly with the Magdalenian. In the Northern Iberian Peninsula, radiocarbon chronology of the last Solutrean sites and the early Magdalenian sites overlaps slightly, while in the South, a gap between both techno-complexes seems probable. This chronological discontinuity might indicate population discontinuity as well, and the South may have been less attractive for human settlement. The most striking feature is a dramatic decrease of Magdalenian sites in the South, while in the North, site numbers almost double and many locales are reoccupied. This indicates increased human activity in the landscape, marking, without a doubt, a clear change in the settlement system. For the first time, a predominance of multi-layered sites is documented in the Magdalenian in Northern Iberia. Interestingly, sites in the South are particularly clustered, while they are more uniformly distributed in the North. Another important element of settlement system and demographic development is displayed by the result of the mating network models: in the North, networks were probably very stable during the Magdalenian, while they were very unstable in the South. The strong coastal orientation of settlements stretches the societiesâ€™ territories and complicates the development of stable mating networks. The distribution of radiocarbon dates supports weak human occupation after the LGM und during HS 1 in Southern Iberia. Only after HS 1 does the data curve increase here again.</p>
