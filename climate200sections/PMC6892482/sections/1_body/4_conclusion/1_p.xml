<p>Our data from the Westernmost Mediterranean indicates significant changes in settlement patterns and site density after the LGM on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. During the Solutrean, major parts of Iberia, with the exception of the Interior and some coastal areas, are consistently populated by hunter-gatherer groups. This pattern abruptly changes with HS 1, as hyperarid zones drastically expand throughout Southern Iberia, from the south-eastern coast via the Interior to the West. High resolution climate modelling indicates that this aridification process is especially severe due to a precipitation minimum at the beginning of the growing season. Magdalenian settlement in the South is probably heavily affected by this climatic impact. The mainly coastally orientated site distribution makes settlement systems and mating networks highly vulnerable to dry spells. During HS 1, networks were probably interrupted by arid zones for several hundreds of years or even shorter periods, causing a strong decline in hunter-gatherer population. Southern Iberia turns out to be a high-risk environment during HS 1 when compared to Northern Iberia, where climate change is less severe and even a contemporaneous expansion of settlement areas is evident. Interestingly, after HS 1 a recovery of the Magdalenian population, marked by site numbers and distribution, is not discernible.</p>
