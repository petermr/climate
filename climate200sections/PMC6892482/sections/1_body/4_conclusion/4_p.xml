<p>At the moment, it is still difficult to decide which scenario is most likely; further research is needed. However, this study illustrates the high potential of the Westernmost Mediterranean for modelling Late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer behaviour in relation to climate change. The data presented shows changes in settlement patterns in the three macro areas of the Westernmost Mediterranean through time, following clearly different trends. The impact of HS 1 was probably a major driving factor behind changes in the settlement system. While Northern Iberia remains stable and evidences even an expansion of human population, Southern Iberia and Morocco can both be classified as temporary high-risk environments that required special adaptive capacity and adjustment.</p>
