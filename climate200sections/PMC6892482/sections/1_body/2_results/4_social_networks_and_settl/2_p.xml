<p>The model under the worst conditions with the highest range and smallest population density of 0.01 people per km
 <sup>2</sup> shows large stable networks during the Solutrean in all settlement areas except for the Interior (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g011">Fig 11</xref>). This changes dramatically in the Magdalenian. Southern Iberia including Portugal disintegrates into patchy isolated settlement areas and small, unstable networks. However, in contrast to the preceding Solutrean, the Magdalenian networks in the North now expand into Central Iberia. A clear division roughly around 40Â° Northern Latitude from the North-West to the South-East through the Iberian Peninsula can be seen. Only one band below this line could theoretically form a stable network; however, as this network is comprised of unsustainable minimum bands, its lifespan would be limited to that of the surrounding bands. It is clear that under the worst conditions, the Magdalenian in the South would not have been sustainable in the long-term. With a simulated increase in population density to 0.025 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>, the pattern on the Iberian Peninsula during the Solutrean remains unchanged. The Magdalenian fares much better, although bands in the far south would still not be stable in the long term. Only at a population density of 0.05 people per km
 <sup>2</sup> does the Magdalenian settlement becomes stable over most regions of the Iberian Peninsula, with only the far South-West and a part of the Interior as an exception. The relatively high threshold of 0.025 to 0.05 people per km
 <sup>2</sup> indicates that Southern Iberia was probably unstable for human settlement during the Magdalenian.
