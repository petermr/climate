<p>To study possible effects of these changes in settlement pattern on the population, we applied the Mating Network Model (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g011">11</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g012">12</xref>). Multiple networks were simulated with different range sizes and population densities in order to identify a threshold at which networks could have been sustainable. Again, unknown Iberomaurusian sites are displayed with half transparency.
