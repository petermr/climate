<p>The Early Iberomaurusian overlaps with the Solutrean and the first part of the Magdalenian. During this phase, the Moroccan radiocarbon record is at its weakest, while the contemporaneous Solutrean in Iberia shows intensive human occupation. This changes after the LGM, when Southern Iberia now evidences weak human occupation until the end of HS 1, while the data increases slightly in Morocco. The record in northern Iberia is only very slightly affected by the breakdown of radiocarbon data seen in the South. After HS 1, all regions experience a peak phase of radiocarbon data, which breaks down again during the Younger Dryas.</p>
