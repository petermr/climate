<p>In conclusion, multiple changes in settlement pattern during the Western Mediterranean Late Pleistocene are apparent. Before and during the LGM, site numbers are high in Northern and Southern Iberia, while they are extremely low in Morocco. After the LGM, in the Magdalenian, site numbers increase significantly in Northern Iberia as well as in Morocco, the latter albeit on a much smaller scale, while they decrease markedly in Southern Iberia. This increase of site numbers in Northern Iberia goes hand-in-hand with an increase of multi-layered sites, while the relationship between single-layered and multi-layered sites in the South remains unchanged. In addition to this, more Solutrean sites in the North are reoccupied during the Magdalenian. Sites that yield multi-layered occupations during both techno-complexes are regularly located in the middle of site clusters and along the coasts, and probably represent core areas of human occupation.</p>
