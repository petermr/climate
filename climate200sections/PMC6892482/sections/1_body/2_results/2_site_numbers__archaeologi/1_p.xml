<p>The regional and diachronic distribution of the 300 archaeological sites in our database shows two prominent trends: an increase of site numbers from early to late periods in Northern Iberia and Morocco, and a decrease of sites in Southern Iberia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g006">Fig 6</xref>). While the number of Solutrean sites is higher in the South than in the North, the opposite is visible in the Magdalenian. In the North, the site numbers increase drastically in the later phase, while they decrease in the South. In North-West Africa, a general trend of an increase of site numbers from early to late sites is visible as well. This strong fluctuation of site numbers indicates changes in the settlement system in Iberia and to a lesser extent in the Iberomaurusian of Morocco.
