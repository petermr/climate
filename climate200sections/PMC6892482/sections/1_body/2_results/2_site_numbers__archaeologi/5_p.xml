<p>In addition to this, few sites with occupations during multiple techno-complexes are multi-layered in both time frames (10 in the northern Iberian Peninsula, 5 in the southern Iberian Peninsula and 5 in the Iberomaurusian). In the North, only one of these sites (Cardina I) is located in the interior of the Peninsula, while the other 9 are along the Cantabrian Coast, a region densely settled during both time frames. In the South, 4 of these sites are also located in large clusters on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, with only Nerja being more isolated. In Morocco, 3 of the 5 multi-layered sites from multiple techno-complexes are located in the Eastern Rif, another densely inhabited region, while the other two are located close to neighbouring sites (Kehf el Hammar and Dar es-Soltan 2). Such sites, often amidst clusters of other sites, therefore seem to play a special role in the settlement system.</p>
