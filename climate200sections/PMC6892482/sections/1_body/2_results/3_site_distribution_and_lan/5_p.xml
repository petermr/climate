<p>To translate these results onto a map and analyse the geographical distribution of the site clusters, we calculated the KDE. The KDE bandwidth was derived from the mean of all mean nearest neighbour distances (17.942 km); the resulting figures can be interpreted as models of the intensity of human influence on the landscape based on inter-site mobility.</p>
