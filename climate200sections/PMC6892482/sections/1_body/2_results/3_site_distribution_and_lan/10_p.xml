<p>The site density analyses show clear differences in land use pattern over time and space in Iberia. In the North, settlement expands and becomes more homogeneous through time, while it is more constricted in the South. In North-West Africa, settlement structure is very dispersed with low site density and gets more stable only in the Late Iberomaurusian; this difference to Southern Iberia will be subject to further discussion.</p>
