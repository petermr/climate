<p>In the Solutrean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g009">Fig 9</xref>), we can see multiple areas of dense site clusters along the Northern coast, along the Southern Mediterranean coast and in Portugal. Only isolated clusters and sites show up in Central Iberia. In the Magdalenian the pattern changes. In the North, settlement disperses into the Interior and the North-East while a simultaneous increase in activity on the northern coast is documented. The site distribution shows a rather homogeneous use of a larger territory. The opposite is visible in the South: large stretches of land are now abandoned, and the sites form much smaller, tighter clusters. On the western Atlantic coast, density values remain on the high level of the preceding Solutrean, while they decrease and condense on the eastern Mediterranean coast. This reflects continuity of human activity in the West and decreased human activity in the South-East.
