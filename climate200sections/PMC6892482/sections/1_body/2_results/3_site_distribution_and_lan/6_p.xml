<p>Following the previous discussion of multi- and single-layered sites, we think it adequate to incorporate a weighting factor into the model to reflect more or less intense use in accordance to the archaeological data. Multi-layered sites are weighted with 2 instead of the default weighting 1, to reflect repeated occupation of the site by people during one techno-complex. For the Late Iberomaurusian, the situation is somewhat more complicated. Due to the more rapid sediment accumulation of the escargotière, a multi-layered Iberomaurusian site is not comparable to a multi-layered site from the Iberian Peninsula. Because of this, we derived more intense use from the thickness of the escargotière in published site stratigraphies. Settlement layers thicker than our (arbitrary) limit of 50cm were weighted like multi-layered sites with a value of 2; all other sites had the same default weighting as single-layered sites. Sites without reliable information on stratigraphy were weighted as a single-layered site. The unsure dating of the Iberomaurusian is also problematic. As we aim to examine the increase in site numbers from the Early to Late Iberomaurusian, we cannot combine the time frames as we did in the previous site density analyses. To incorporate this problem in our model, instead of grouping all Iberomaurusian sites into one, we recognize the uncertainty and display all “unknown” sites with half transparency next to the securely dated sites without transparency. The calculations were however undertaken together.</p>
