<p>All site groups are significantly clustered. In the northern Iberian Peninsula, the Solutrean is markedly more clustered than the Magdalenian, evidencing a clear difference in settlement pattern. The increase of Magdalenian sites goes hand-in-hand an expansion of settlement areas. In the southern Iberian Peninsula, the values are almost identical, demonstrating that the decrease of Magdalenian sites did not change the overall settlement structure. In Iberia, the observed mean distances are in higher in the South and especially in the Magdalenian, pointing to an increased mobility compared to Northern Iberia. The Iberomaurusian, with the fewest number of sites, also shows significant clustering, but displays the largest observed mean distance of all techno-complexes. This finding suggests highest mobility in the Iberomaurusian.</p>
