<p>The NMDS used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index to analyse two dimensions with accepted stress of 0.153392. Mowing has resulted in a shift in species composition at both sites, although there is still a considerable degree of overlap, particularly at the oceanic site, where the mown plots are grouped in a smaller ellipse on the ordination diagram, and are therefore noticeably less variable than the unmown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211272.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Although both sites were analysed in a single NMDS, different variables were associated with each site. At the continental site, the environmental variables with the best fit in the model are pH of water (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.191, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) and maximum groundwater level (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.409, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16), while at the oceanic site, these variables are slope angle (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.224, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), peat depth (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.318, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and median groundwater level (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.529, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). Many of the specialist fen species are strongly associated with the mown plots, although 
 <italic>Carex pulicaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Salix myrsinifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Crepis paludosa</italic> are notable exceptions. Relatively few fen specialists are associated with the oceanic site, although 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>palustris</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>ferrugineus</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex microglochin</italic> and 
 <italic>Dactylorhiza incarnata</italic> spp. 
 <italic>incarnata</italic> characterise the mown plots there. Unsurprisingly, 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>caerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>pubescens</italic> are strongly associated with the unmown plots of the oceanic site. At the continental site, the unmown plots are characterised by 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>nana</italic> and 
 <italic>Saussurea alpina</italic>, and the mown plots by, amongst others, 
 <italic>Kobresia simpliciuscula</italic>, 
 <italic>Bryum pseudotriquetrum</italic>, 
 <italic>Carex atrofusca</italic> and
