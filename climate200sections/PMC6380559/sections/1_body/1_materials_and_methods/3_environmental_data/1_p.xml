<p>The Norwegian Meteorological Institute provided spatially interpolated estimates of temperature and precipitation for both sites from 1960 onwards, with target elevations of 460 and 725 m above sea level (a.s.l.) for Tågdalen and Sølendet respectively. Temperature estimations were modelled with residual kriging [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and data from a weather station that were established at each site in 2007 (a few hundred meters from the localities) were included in the estimates. Effective temperature sum (ETS) were calculated using a formula developed for the boreal zone [

 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Precipitation sums were the annual volume of rainfall at each site (mm). Mean peat depth and pH in water in each locality was measured in each plot. At Tågdalen this was done when the localities were established (1967–69), and at Sølendet this was done in 1981. All measurements was carried out in August or September. Production is the dry aboveground biomass measured when the localities were first mown after &gt; 20 years of abandonment. Groundwater levels within both sites were modelled using the MODFLOW-based approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using this approach we developed transient groundwater flow models in order to simulate the response of the fen’s hydrology to boundary conditions defined by groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration and natural drainage. As the geology at both sites is similar, developed models simulated groundwater flow in peat and underlying strata of morainic sediments. Models were calibrated using groundwater level data collected in Tågdalen and Sølendet in 2009–2013. Simulations of groundwater level fluctuations in each of the sites analysed were based on 10-day intervals for the period 2001–2013. Hydrological conditions of the sites were described by mean, median, maximum and minimum groundwater depths (m), magnitude (range between the highest and the lowest water levels modelled, m), duration (time, which particular groundwater depths lasted for, days) and inundation (days/year).
