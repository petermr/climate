<p>We sampled plots in homogenous stands of vegetation and estimated species cover on a six-degree scale. In each plot, the cover of each species was estimated using a scale close to the Hult-Sernander-DuRietz scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with the classes 1: &lt; 6.25%, 2: 6.3–12.5%, 3: 12.6–25%, 4: 26–50%, 5: 51–75% and 6: 76–100%. In some plots, we estimated species cover at a finer resolution, but all analyses were transformed to the referred scale. All cover class values were then converted to percentage cover using the mid value of each cover class as percentage cover before data analysis [

Both the homogeneity and the cover of species were judged subjectively, bringing some inaccuracy into the analyses, as can also occur through differences between plots inside the localities [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Results from the data analyses were therefore interpreted with caution. Nomenclature follows Elven [
