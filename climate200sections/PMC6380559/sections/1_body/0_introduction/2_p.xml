<p>Boreal fens require cool and humid climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], although the occurrence of fens is widely held to be driven primarily by local edaphic conditions, and to depend only secondarily on climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The effect of climate change, and its interaction with management, on boreal rich fen vegetation is currently unclear, although interactions between drivers of change can play an important role in determining plant communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Plant species in this region are often particularly sensitive to climatic warming [

 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The effect of climate on fen species can also vary along an oceanicâ€”continental gradient, i.e. between coastal and inland areas [
