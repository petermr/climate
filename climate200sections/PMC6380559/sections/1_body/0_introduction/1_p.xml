<p>Many ecosystems of high conservation value have been shaped by human activity, and rely heavily on the continuation of traditional management methods, particularly in grasslands and wetlands [

 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mowing is widely held to promote plant species diversity by increasing accessibility of light and heat [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Fens are among the most diverse ecosystems in the boreal region [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and are priority habitats for conservation that harbour a high number of specialised and endangered species [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For centuries, fens were important for hay production and as pastures for livestock grazing throughout Europe. Regular harvesting turned large areas of fen vegetation into open semi-natural landscapes [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the widespread traditional use of fens ended many decades ago across most of Europe. The cessation of management often results in the displacement of specialist fen species following secondary succession of competitive species, particularly by graminoids and shrubs, and subsequent biomass accumulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The grass 
 <italic>Molinia caerulea</italic> is a particularly strong competitor in fens and can invade rapidly, causing a reduction in species richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, traditionally-managed hay fens are threatened all over Europe, including Norway [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where 105 of 246 Red-Listed vascular plant species (ca. 43%) are found primarily in semi-natural habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite this, only 200 ha out of more than 300 000 ha of former hay fens are mown as a management measure [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is, therefore, a clear need for restoration measures in this valuable habitat in order to increase the abundance of specialist fen species, both vascular plants and bryophytes, to maintain viable populations, and more research to facilitate evidence-based management for fen restoration.
