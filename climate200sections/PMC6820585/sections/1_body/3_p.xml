<p>Some believe that climate change is too narrowly focused. The idea of Planetary Health was introduced in 2015 by The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Planetary health aims not only to investigate the effects of environmental change on human health, but also to study the political, economic, and social systems that govern those effects. In addition to assessing the impact on human health, planetary health also takes into account poverty, nutrition, gender equity, water and sanitation, energy, economic growth, industrialization, inequality, urbanization, human consumption and production, climate change, ocean health, land use, peace, and justice. As conceived, planetary health is a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary subject with a focus on addressing challenges to maintain and enhance human health in the face of increasingly harmful environmental trends.
