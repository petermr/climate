<p id="Par16">Each strategic policy and Act was entered into NVivo 11 and read at least twice. The first read was relatively superficial, aiding researcher familiarity. This was followed by a second reading which involved closer interpretation, with a focus on coding the content according to pre-defined categories (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The framing of each strategic policy and Act was examined and the goals, objectives, strategies, and values articulated throughout were assessed to determine how and whether they aligned with the intent of progressing health, well-being and equity. Explicit mentions of words associated with health did not need to appear for segments of text to be coded. Instead, text 
 <italic>interpreted</italic> as relevant to SDH/HE was also coded, guided by the list in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.
