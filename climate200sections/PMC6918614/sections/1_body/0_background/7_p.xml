<p id="Par11">Interwoven throughout our policy analysis are references to neoliberalism. Miller and Orchard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] discuss neoliberalism as an ideology that shapes public policy in Australia. Neoliberalism is based on the assumptions that sustained economic growth will have benefits that trickle down to benefit all people, and that free markets are most effective at achieving economic growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Neoliberalism also emphasises the importance of minimal state intervention in economic and social affairs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], privileging individuals and businesses as entrepreneurial agents in generating capital and new markets. Miller and Orchard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] argue that the neoliberal values that shape Australian policy often conflict with social democratic values, such as equity and social justice. Neoliberal politics in Australia has been characterised by the use of state institutions and resources to promote and/or protect private interests. Neoliberal ideas and values have also been used to justify the absence of strong policies on environmental protection by instead privileging narrow economic goals and pursuits. Where relevant, the concept of neoliberalism is drawn upon in this paper to illuminate some of the values that inform the policies, and that operate to shape the policy directions analysed in this paper.
