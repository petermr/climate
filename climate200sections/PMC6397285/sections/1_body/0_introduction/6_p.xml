 </sup> and the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) were applied to the 17 CMIP5 global climate models to project the variability of NH permafrost extent when surface temperatures reach thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. The validation of the periods that correspond to thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C is described in Section 2. Section 3 considers the permafrost area over the NH simulated by the CMIP5 models, including the present-day permafrost area and future permafrost area projected under the scenarios of 1.5 °C and 2 °C of temperature increase. Finally, Section 4 summarises key findings. The specific datasets and methods used in this study are described in the Methods section.
