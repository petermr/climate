 </sup> and the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD)

 </sup>. Both datasets report carbon down to 1 m depth. Carbon was partitioned across the top seven CLM4 layers (~1 m depth) as in Lawrence and Slater

 </sup>. The soil type and organic data were adapted from the land surface data of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The soil column was subdivided into 10 layers, with the maximum depth of soil being 3.8019 m at a resolution of 0.23° × 0.31°. This selection implies that the permafrost areas and permafrost loss calculated in this study indicate permafrost extent at depths less than 3.8 m. Organic matter density was calculated based on the weights of the soil column at 10 soil layers. The layer of mineral soil and organic matter was considered to be a homogeneous medium with different thermal properties in the frozen and thawed states. The details of the parameter settings in Kudryavtsev’s method can be found in Animov
