<p id="Par16">It is inevitable that the reduction in permafrost area will lead to a change in surface energy balance and consequently to changes in land–atmosphere interactions that will probably generate ongoing environmental deterioration and unpredictable changes to the climate. However, the results of this study seem slightly hopeful for the permafrost environment, since two-thirds of permafrost will remain under RCP8.5 (2037–2046) at a threshold of 2 °C rise, some permafrost will even remain in some of the Earth’s colder areas until the end of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century

 </sup>. It should be noted that the results of this study do not imply that regions of seasonal frozen ground will expand because of higher winter temperatures. Moreover, although we adopted the results of MME and considered vegetation and soil moisture variability, uncertainties still remain, such as the use of CMIP5 data and lack of precise observations of the soil type and organic matter.
