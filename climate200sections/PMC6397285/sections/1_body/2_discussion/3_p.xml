<p id="Par15">Under continuous global warming from the 1.5 °C threshold to the 2 °C threshold, the projected southern permafrost boundary shifts 1° to 4° northwards under three RCPs. Compared with the historical period (1986–2005), the most significant degradation occurs in northern Mongolia and southern Russia. Under RCP2.6, the extent of permafrost remains almost stablely existed. When the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C threshold, the projected permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere is about 12.81 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. By the end of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, the permafrost extent in the Northern Hemisphere is about 12.65 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. If the global economy keeps increasing at the current rate (e.g. under RCP4.5), the permafrost areas corresponding to the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds, respectively, are 12.33 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10.38 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. This represents a decrease of 1.95 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, or 15.8%, between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. If human society does not take any action to decrease emissions (e.g. under RCP8.5), the degradation of the permafrost is more significant, showing permafrost areas corresponding to the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds, respectively, of 12.09 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10.13 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. This represents a decrease of 1.96 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, or about 16.2%, between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. Relative to the historical period (1986–2005), the permafrost area at the 1.5 °C threshold decreases by 23.58%, 24.1% and 25.55% under the three RCPs. For the 2 °C threshold, increased radiative forcing leads to a greater decline in permafrost area, showing decreases of 22.11%, 36.08% and 37.62%, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
