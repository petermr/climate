<p id="Par9">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> present the statistical results from individual models. The results indicate the time that the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds. The results also clearly show that the simulation time in different RCP scenarios taken to reach the thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C under different RCP scenarios are quite different from one another, especially for RCP2.6. Since each model in CMIP5 represents a possible future, some models (such as NorESM1-M in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are not excluded in this study. The results shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> also show that over half of the models would not reach the 2 °C threshold in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century. Because the data in most of the RCPs cover the period of 2006–2100, years beyond 2100 are marked as 2100, which causes the maximum, median and upper quartiles to overlap. The results of the MME (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) show that the threshold of 1.5 °C occurs in 2027, 2026 and 2023, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, the global mean surface temperature under RCP2.6 does not reach the 2 °C threshold until the end of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century and only reaches about 1.9 °C by 2100. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the 2 °C threshold is reached in 2046 and 2037, respectively, which agrees with previous studies

 </sup>. We note clear differences in the timing of the 2 °C threshold being reached under the three RCPs. For instance, the stronger the radiation force, the sooner the threshold of 2 °C is reached, although this relationship is not evident for the 1.5 °C threshold in these RCPs. A possible reason for this observation is that the present global mean surface temperature is close to the threshold of the 1.5 °C scenario, and radiation has a delayed effect on surface temperature. Consequently, there is little difference between radiative forcing and the year in which global average surface temperature rises to 1.5 °C.
