 </sup> and hysteresis. We define the initial year of five consecutive years when global mean surface temperature meets thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C, then the subsequent 10 years are regarded as the period that meets the thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the projected change in permafrost extent under the three RCP scenarios for temperature rises of 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C compared to pre-industrial levels. The southern permafrost boundary shifts northwards by 1° to 4° latitude under the three RCPs between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C levels. Compared with the historical period (1986–2005), significant degradation occurs in northern Mongolia and southern Russia. When the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C threshold, the MME (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) shows that the permafrost extent in the NH would be 12.81 ± 3.31 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 12.33 ± 4.46 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 12.09 ± 3.31 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively, under RCP2.6 (2027–2036), RCP4.5 (2026–2035) and RCP8.5 (2023–2032). Relative to the historical period, these represent reductions in permafrost extent of 23.58%, 24.10% and 25.55%, respectively. However, uncertainty is evident because of the large discrepancies among the models’ performance on temperature simulation over cold regions. When the global mean surface temperature reaches the 2 °C threshold, permafrost areas in the NH would be 10.38 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10.13 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively, in RCP4.5 (2046–2055) and RCP8.5 (2037–2046). These would, respectively, constitute reductions relative to the historical period of 36.08% and 37.62%, respectively, for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Compared to the historical period, the most obvious degradation occurs in northern Mongolia and southern Russia, and the southern permafrost boundary moves northwards by about 3° to 4° between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C thresholds under RCP4.5. It must be noted that the global mean surface temperature under RCP2.6 does not rise by 2 °C until the end of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century. The extent of the permafrost in the NH in 2100 is about 12.65 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, a reduction of 22.11% relative to the historical period. This reduction shows the southern permafrost boundary in Canada and the United States to move northwards and the area of the permafrost in northern Mongolia to decrease slightly. The projected reductions in permafrost area under the three RCPs vary between 23% and 26% at the 1.5 °C threshold and range from 36% to 38% at the 2.0 °C threshold. Relative to the 1.5 °C threshold, the permafrost area at the 2 °C threshold would be reduced by 1.95 × 10

 <sup>2</sup> (i.e. 15.8%) and 1.96 × 10
