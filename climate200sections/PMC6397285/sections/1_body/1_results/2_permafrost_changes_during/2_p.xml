 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the active layer thickness (ALT) in NH permafrost regions during the 1986–2005 period, estimated from CMIP5 data. Results indicate that the ALT deepens from high latitude to low latitude and that deeper ALTs (e.g. &gt;225 cm) are mainly located in the Mongolian Plateau and Greater Khingan. Considering the calculation of mean bias, correlation coefficient and regression coefficient under different ALT estimation methods, the Kudryavtsev method could well reflect the correlation between simulation and observation. The correlation coefficient and regression coefficient, both statistically significant at the 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 level, are 0.53 and 0.17, respectively. The mean bias in the Kudryavtsev method is relatively small (23.55 cm), implying the high performance of the Kudryavtsev method for permafrost simulation.
