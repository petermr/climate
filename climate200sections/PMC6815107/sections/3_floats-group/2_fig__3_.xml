  <p>Water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to occupancy decline in desert birds. (
   <italic>A</italic>) The increase in cooling costs over the past century of warming (∼1.5 °C) was positively related to avian body mass. (
   <italic>B</italic>) An interaction between diet and cooling costs revealed that occupancy decline in carnivores and insectivores (purple) was highly associated with water requirements but less so in herbivores and omnivores (blue). (
   <italic>C</italic>) The number of additional insects per day required to offset the increase in cooling costs assuming a diet of herbivorous stink bugs (
   <italic>Dendrocoris contaminates</italic> in green), beetles (
   <italic>Edrotes ventricosus</italic> in yellow), and grasshoppers (
   <italic>Bootettix argentatus</italic> in red). Larger birds need to find more prey than smaller birds, but they can reduce the number of prey needed by finding larger, yet more dispersed prey. Silhouettes were downloaded from
