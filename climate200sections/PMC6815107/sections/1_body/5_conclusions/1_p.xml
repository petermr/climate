<p content-type="flushleft">Species interactions are thought to cause most climate-driven extinctions to date (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), partly because the physiological bases of climate vulnerability are complicated by thermodynamic relationships with the environment. By directly modeling the water requirements of desert birds, our study illustrates the importance of an intrinsic, physiological basis of avian decline that is associated with climate change (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We uncovered greater climate vulnerability in larger species from accelerated water requirements, which was especially relevant for birds with animal-based diets and at sites without surface water.
