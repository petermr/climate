<p>Water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines as climate change spreads warm and dry conditions across the planet over the next century (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Thus, species with large body size, with animal-based diets, and that violate Bergmann’s rule may become more vulnerable globally. Although our study focused on a physiologically challenging desert environment, ecologists can leverage climate–organism interactions to identify the relevance of other intrinsic, physiological factors. In tropical environments, for instance, rising temperatures may predispose ectotherms with high thermal sensitivities to greater climate vulnerability (
