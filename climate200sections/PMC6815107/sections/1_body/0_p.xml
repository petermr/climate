 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), prompting an urgent need to identify the mechanisms that make species vulnerable (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Vulnerability to climate change increases when environmental conditions challenge an organism’s capacity to balance heat and water budgets (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), suggesting physiological mechanisms will underlie some population declines (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the physiological bases of climate vulnerability are often inferred indirectly from population declines (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and empirical evidence supports the uncoupling of species interactions as the most common cause of climate-driven extinctions (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A major impediment to detecting the physiological bases of climate vulnerability is the complex nature of the organism–climate interaction, especially for endotherms. Heat transfer through avian plumage and mammal pelage complicates our understanding of the homeothermic requirements of endotherms (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Establishing meaningful links between physiology and long-term population responses to climate change would represent a major advance for predicting endotherm climate vulnerability.
