<p>Over the past century, the Mojave Desert bird community collapsed in association with a long-term reduction in precipitation from climate change (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Despite being located primarily on protected lands, sites lost on average 43% of their breeding bird species and occupancy probability declined significantly for 29% of the 135 species. Our simulations revealed a potential physiological basis underlying the community collapse by linking climate with the fundamental need to thermoregulate. The probability of a species persisting was lowest at the hottest, driest sites and at sites without surface water (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, these conditions challenge the capacity of endotherms to offload excess heat via evaporative cooling. Persistence of species was also moderately lower at cooler, wetter sites at high elevations (

 </xref>), suggestive of multiple underlying mechanisms. These high elevation sites were the wettest sites but also experienced the greatest increase in average temperature and a recent destructive fire (
