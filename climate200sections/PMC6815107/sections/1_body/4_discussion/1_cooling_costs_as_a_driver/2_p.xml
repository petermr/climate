<p>We developed a heat flux model for birds that used similar equations derived from the same general theory as previous approaches (

 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), with 2 exceptions. We focused on the change in cooling costs without incorporating basal water requirements, and we modeled heat flux on the dorsal and ventral sides separately, as opposed to averaging across the whole organism. Quantifying the change in cooling costs isolated the impact of climate change on water requirements independent of the costs imposed by obligatory water loss to offset metabolic heat production (i.e., basal water requirements). Incorporating basal water requirements would not affect our interpretations, because basal cooling costs scale positively with body size (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, incorporating these rates would further exacerbate the size-mediated impact of climate change on cooling costs. We also modeled heat flux by considering morphological differences across the dorsal and ventral sides of birds (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Simulating heat flux in this way offers an opportunity to incorporate the physiological role of morphological variation, such as differences in feather absorptance between the dorsum and ventrum (
