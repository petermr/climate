<p>A bird’s sensitivity to cooling costs may also depend on its behavioral repertoire and the availability of cooler microhabitats. During the hottest periods of the day, desert birds restrict foraging to shaded microhabitats or cease foraging entirely (

 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The ability of small insectivores, like the Verdin, to forage in the shade reduces heat gain from the environment while maintaining energy and water intake (
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), possibly contributing to the higher persistence of smaller birds over the last century. Larger birds, however, likely struggle to access cooler conditions due to the small dimensions of commonly available microhabitats (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Moreover, large carnivorous birds in the Mojave Desert are most often observed perching in direct sunlight (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), which increases water requirements for evaporative cooling from solar exposure. Desert birds can dramatically lower cooling costs by ceasing activity, finding cool microhabitats, or soaring to higher altitudes, but such behaviors involve spending less time foraging, defending territories, and finding mates (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)—all important components of fitness (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Having less time for fitness-related activities might also have a disproportionate impact on larger bodied birds.
