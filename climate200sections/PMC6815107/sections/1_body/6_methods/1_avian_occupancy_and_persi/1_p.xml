<p>Resurveys evaluated the response of desert birds to climate and environmental change at 61 sites throughout the Mojave Desert that were originally surveyed for avian diversity during the early 20th century by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues (

 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) used a dynamic, multispecies occupancy model (MSOM) that incorporated imperfect detection to yield species-specific estimates of occupancy probability (the proportion of sites occupied during historical and modern surveys) for 135 bird species. Values from their dataset S1 were used to calculate the difference between historic and modern occupancy (ΔΨ) for each species. Here, we modified their MSOM to test whether species occupying hot, dry sites, where the demand for evaporative water for cooling is greatest, were less likely to persist over the past century. Detection covariates included era to account for differences between the time periods, and Julian day and its quadratic term to allow detection to vary during the breeding season. Initial occupancy covariates included historic climate averages (annual precipitation, mean annual temperature) during the initial survey period (1906 to 1965) derived from the basin characterization model (BCM) (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), using a 5-km window to capture local variability. We included the same climate covariates measured from 1986 to 2015 for persistence. Colonization was modeled without covariates because it rarely occurred (γ = 0.003; 95% credible interval, &lt;0.001 to 0.009). See ref.
