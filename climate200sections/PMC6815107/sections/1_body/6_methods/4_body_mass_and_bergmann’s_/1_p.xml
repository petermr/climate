<p>We examined the consequences for 50 species of Mojave birds of geographic variation in body mass on water requirements for evaporative cooling. We evaluated the association between body mass and air temperature for each species (

We grouped species based upon the sign of their slope to categorize species and determine whether the magnitude of body size variation (either supporting or countering Bergmannâ€™s rule) was associated with occupancy decline. We then used our simulation to determine whether geographic variation in body mass had consequences for cooling costs in the Mojave Desert. For each species, we calculated the cooling costs from simulations that used the body mass 1) associated with the Mojave Desert and 2) from the highest latitude from western North America for that species. The analysis was designed to estimate the relative costs or benefits of body size difference in the Mojave Desert. We calculated the change in cooling costs (in watts) between each location and expressed the difference relative to the average mass in the Mojave. We then examined associations between these values and the change in occupancy.
