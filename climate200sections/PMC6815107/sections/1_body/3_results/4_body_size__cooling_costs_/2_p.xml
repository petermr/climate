<p>We estimated the consequences of body size variation by comparing cooling costs from simulations that used the observed geographic variation in body size to those that held body size constant. The analysis determined whether the increase or reduction in body mass with respect to latitude was related to the collapse of desert birds. Occupancy decline over the last century was unrelated to the reduction in cooling requirements for species that followed Bergmann’s rule (

 </xref>), suggesting that reductions in body size alleviated some of the water requirements for Mojave birds. For species with a pattern counter to Bergmann’s rule, however, occupancy declines were positively related to cooling costs resulting from increased body size in the Mojave (
