Most bird species tended to follow Bergmann’s rule, as reflected by smaller masses in warmer climates (negative slopes for 80%, 40 out of 50 species, of which 22 were significant), while 20% tended to exhibit larger masses, counter to Bergmann’s rule (positive slopes for 10 species, of which 2 were significant) (
