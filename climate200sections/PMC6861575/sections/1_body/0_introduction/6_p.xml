<p id="p0030">The evidence of gender differences in climate vulnerability is a primary reason for the differences in climate adaptation by men and women. Women are often constrained in decision making and access to resources that can improve their livelihoods (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carr and Thompson, 2014</xref>). These resources and other sociocultural differences for instance, have led to the cultivation of crops with different biophysical characteristics by men and women (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Carr and Thompson, 2014</xref>). Evidence also showed that while many male farmers cultivate drought resistant crop varieties, female farmers on the other hand, engage in the cultivation of traditional crops and mixed cropping (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Wrigley-Asante et al. (2017)</xref> also found that while men were more interested in on-farm adaptation strategies, women are more interested in off-farm adaptation strategies such as petty trading. 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Assan et al. (2018)</xref> also observed that many male farmers compared to their female counterparts adopted strategies that would help them respond appropriately to climate shocks. These empirical evidences show that climate adaptation is either low for females than males or the strategies adopted by males is different from that adopted by females.
