<p id="p0025">Like other aspects of climate change, adaptation is not gender neutral. For instance,

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Mersha and Laerhoven (2016)</xref> explained that observed difference in gendered climate adaptation are as a result of gender barriers and not a preferred decision by men and women. Admittedly, there is growing research on climate adaptation across the world (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abid et al., 2016</xref>). However, considering the significant role of gender in development, it is required that research within the climate change domain should address gender concerns. As such, research into identifying how gender groups, especially women, can adapt effectively to climate change is required (
