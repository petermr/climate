<p id="p0085">The results show that the primary adaptation strategy adopted by the farmers is to change the planting date for their crops in order to respond to erratic, particularly, late onset of rainfall. Except three female members, all farmers from other gender groups had changed their planting dates from the previous production seasons. Thus, for instance, the farmers did not plant their 2018 seeds within the same periods as they did in 2017; instead, they had adjusted based on the rainfall conditions of the previous year.
