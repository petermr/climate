<p id="p0090">The adoption of early maturing seed varieties was the second most adopted adaptation strategy among the farmers. In recent times, there have been continued introduction of early maturing seed varieties by research institutions across the country. These are aimed at responding particularly to the increasing erratic and short duration rains. The result shows that the adoption of early maturing seed varieties was high for males compared to females. This could be associated with the generally low access to production inputs by female farmers. Related to early maturing seed varieties is the adoption of drought resistant seed varieties. Majority of the farmers had adopted drought tolerant seed varieties, but this was higher for non-household heads compared with household heads. Also, the adoption of drought tolerant seed varieties was higher for males (73.5%) than females (68.4%). This is consistent with the findings of
