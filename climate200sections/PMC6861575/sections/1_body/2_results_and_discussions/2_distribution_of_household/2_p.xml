 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref> shows the distribution of the selected respondents based on their sex and household headship status. This formed the basis and the definition of gender in this study. Thus, the current study moved beyond the definition of gender using household headship (male heads versus female heads) or farm management (male managers versus female managers) in previous studies. In this study, these two measurements are combined, and gender is defined as male heads, male members (male farm hands/managers), female heads and female members (female farm hands/managers). These are determined based on their position in the family; thus, a household head was conceptualized as a person who is the leader of a family at a particular point in time, while a farm hand/manager is a person who is a member of a family and operates a personal farm. Contemporary feminist research and the intersectionality-inspired literature on gender, expressed the limitation of defining gender as man and woman or as a stand-alone maker of social differentiation since this ignores significant variations in terms of knowledge, power and resources within the groups (
