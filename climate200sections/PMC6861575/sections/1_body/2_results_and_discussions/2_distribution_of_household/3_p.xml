<p id="p0065">From the result (as indicated in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), 61.3% of the respondents are household heads with the remaining 38.7% being household members. The distributions show that 59.3% of the respondents are male, of which 84.3% and 15.7% are heads and household members, respectively. The remaining 40.7% of the sample are female, of which 27.9% and 72.1% are heads and household members, respectively. This shows that while majority of the male respondents are household heads; majority of the female respondents are only household members who operate their own farms. This is because household headship in almost all Ghanaian cultures is a reserved duty more for the males. Generally, females assume household headship status only when there is no male adult in the household especially due to divorce, death of husband or when the husband or male adult has travelled out of the community for a longer period.
