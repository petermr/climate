However, this collective action is precluded by the &#x02018;consensus gap&#x02019; between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average ~1000 km south (velocity ~20 km.year<sup>-1</sup>), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid&#x02019;s climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech&#x02019;s climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>DOB Ecology</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crowther</surname><given-names>Thomas W.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Author TWC is supported by grant from DOB Ecology.

Often limited to ad-hoc reporting of extreme weather events or intangible, long-term climate impacts (e.g. changes in average temperature by 2100). Despite an exhaustive list of risks associated to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (e.g. heat stress, air and water quality, food supply, distribution of vectors of diseases, social factors), the intangible nature of reporting on climate change fails to adequately convey the urgency of this issue to a public audience on a consistent basis[<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is hard for most people to envision how an additional 2&#x000b0;C of warming might affect daily life. This ineffective communication of climate change facts, compounded by uncertainty about the extent of expected changes, has left the door open for widespread misinterpretation about the existence of this global phenomenon.</p><p>History has repeatedly shown us that data and facts alone do not inspire humans to change their beliefs or act [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increased scientific literacy has no correlation with the acceptance of climate change facts [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A growing body of research demonstrates that visualization&#x02014;the ability to create a mental image of the problem&#x02014;is the most effective approach for motivating behavior change [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several studies have analyzed &#x02018;geographic shifts&#x02019; to better illustrate climate change. For example, Seidel and colleagues (2008) [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that climate change has driven a widening of the tropical belt, by ~2 to 4.8 latitudinal degrees in recent decades. Similarly, the changing conditions of cities around the world provides another tangible example of shifting climate regimes. Given that over 50% of the global population exists within cities [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], these urban environments potentially valuable tool to visualize the impact of climate change at a global scale. As iconic locations, cities are associated with distinct sets of environmental conditions. As such, shifts in the climate conditions of these urban areas could provide a unique opportunity for people to visualize the impacts of climate change, and to establish effective response strategies to address the effects.</p><p>Several studies [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and press reports [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have shown that the use of &#x02018;cities geographic shift&#x02019; or &#x0201c;city analogues&#x0201d; can help to understand and visualize the effects of climate change. In particular, cities can serve as useful climate analog, enabling people to visualize their own climate future via comparison with other cities that currently experience those climate conditions. However, until now, existing research have been focused on regional- or continent-scale analyses in North America or Europe [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and we lack a unifying global perspective. These regional trends suggest that cities are likely to resemble those at lower latitudes as the climate continues to warm. However, it remains unclear if this trend holds at a global scale, as other climate drivers such as changing precipitation regimes may obscure these latitudinal trends. As such, Southern Hemisphere or tropical cities, which already exist in warm conditions and are likely to experience considerable changes in precipitation and extreme climate variation, may show independent geographic shifts under changing climate conditions. Generating a unified understanding of the shifts in the climate conditions of the world&#x02019;s cities is critical if we are going to visualize the impacts of climate change in any biogeographic region. Generating this understanding requires a global perspective and the use of a full range of climate variables to represent the entire climate regime of those regions.</p><p>In this study, we evaluate the global shifts in the climate conditions of cities by taking current climate data for the world&#x02019;s 520 major cities (Current Cities), and project what they will most closely resemble in 2050 (Future Cities). Rather than describing the quantitative changes in climate variables [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we propose to quantify city climate analogs at a global scale [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], i.e. assessing which Current Cities will most closely resemble the climate conditions of Future Cities. To tackle previous limitations, we explore these patterns at a global scale using 19 bioclimatic variables, to include climate variability and seasonality in addition to climate averages.</p><p>Specifically, we aim to test three questions: (i) What proportion of the world&#x02019;s major cities of the future most closely resemble their own current climate conditions <italic>vs</italic>. the climate conditions of other cities in different geographic regions? (ii) What proportion of cities will experience novel climate conditions that are outside the range experiences by cities today? (iii) If cities do shift their climate conditions, is this spatial shift uniform in direction across the planet?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Selection of major cities</title><p>We selected these &#x0201c;major&#x0201d; cities of the world from the &#x0201c;LandScan (2016) High Resolution global Population Data Set&#x0201d; created by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

By using this optimistic climate change scenario, we represent conservative changes in climate conditions that are likely to occur even if substantial climate change mitigation occurs.

Despite our use of a highly optimistic climate change scenario (i.e. RCP 4.5), we show that the climate conditions of over 77% of world&#x02019;s major cities will change to such a great extent that they will resemble more closely the conditions of another major city. The projected shifts showed consistent biogeographic trends, with all city climates (both southern and northern hemisphere) generally shifting towards the conditions in warmer, low-latitude regions. The extent and consistency of these patterns provides a stark reminder of the global scale of this climate change threat and associated risks for human health. In contrast to previous analyses, our analysis also reveals that 22% of the world&#x02019;s cities are likely to exist in a climatic regime that does not current exist on the planet today. These trends highlight the extreme vulnerability of tropical and sub-tropical cities, 30% of which will experience shifts into entirely novel climate regimes with no existing analogues across the world&#x02019;s major cities. This lends support to the idea of novel climates, which are expected to emerge in many tropical and sub-tropical regions [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It should be noted that, by defining the climate envelope using a convex-hull (i.e. by defining a volume from simplices (&#x0201c;triangles&#x0201d;) that form the smallest convex simplicial complex of a set of input points in 4-dimensional space), we applied a conservative method for evaluating future change. Indeed, because it includes the smallest level of extrapolation and generating the smallest possible shapes, this approach has a low-risk of incorrectly identifying novel climate conditions, relative to a concave-hull approach [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, this approach necessarily comes with the high likelihood of missing some novel climates. The 22% of cities experiencing a novel climate must therefore be seen as a highly conservative estimate.</p><p>Our findings also support previous studies conducted in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and north America [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], stressing the current trend of north-to-south geographical shift across the northern hemisphere. Yet, using an optimistic climate change scenario, we found that the velocity (i.e. the speed of geographical shift) risks to be higher in the near future than in the second half of the 21th century [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] passing from 15 km year<sup>-1</sup> to 20 km year<sup>-1</sup>. Our study also allows the extension of such observations to the global scale, showing that observations for Europe can be generalized for the entire Northern Hemisphere and for a part of the southern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At the global scale, our study reveals that geographical shift tend to converge towards the subtropics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g004">Fig 4</xref>), going to warmer climate conditions from boreal and temperate regions and to drier conditions from tropical regions. While this lends support to previous observations of a &#x0201c;tropical belt widening&#x0201d; due to the expected warmer conditions [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it also shows that tropical biomes tend to shrink in many areas due to drier conditions. We therefore suggest here to refer to a &#x0201c;sub-tropical widening&#x0201d; compared to the previous &#x0201c;tropical widening&#x0201d; due to climate change.</p><p>While our findings are necessarily dependent on the methodology used to identify the climatic shifts, it is widely recognized that the choice of the metric to assess the similarity-dissimilarity of the climate conditions between cities has an extremely minor effect, compared to the choice of the climate model and scenario[<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. That is, our results are unlikely to be affected whatever method we use to calculate dissimilarity, as the variation between climate projections is far greater. Nonetheless, Mahony and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] highlighted the need to standardize the contribution of each climate variable to the dissimilarity matrix and to account for correlation between them to avoid any bias[<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, we address this using a scaled principal component analysis to summarize the main bioclimatic variations among the 520 major cities. This approach simply follows classic dissimilarity analysis recommendations for ecological studies[<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], applying an Euclidean distance matrix on the main dimensions of the principal component analysis to assess the similarity between cities. This method was preferred to the sigma-dissimilarity developed by Mahony and colleagues[<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for its simplicity and it broad use in ecological sciences.</p><p>Our analysis allows us to visualize a tangible climate future of the world&#x02019;s major cities. These results enable decision makers from all sectors of society, to envision changes that are likely to occur in their own city, within their own lifetime. Londoners, for example, can start to consider how their 2050 equivalents (e.g. Barcelona today) have taken action to combat their own environmental challenges. In 2008, Barcelona experienced extreme drought conditions, which required the importation of &#x020ac;22m of drinking water. Since then, the municipal government has implemented a series of &#x02018;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.libelium.com/saving-water-with-smart-irrigation-system-in-barcelona/">smart initiatives</ext-link>&#x02018; to manage the city&#x02019;s water resources (including the control of park irrigation and water fountain levels). The Mayor of London has factored drought considerations into his Environment Strategy aims for 2050 [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but this study can provide the context to facilitate the development of more targeted climate strategies. In addition, this information can also empower local citizens to evaluate proposed environmental policies. By allowing people to visualize their own climate futures, we hope that this information can facilitate efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p><p>Our study is not a novel model revealing updated climate projections or expectations by 2050. Instead, our analysis is intended to illustrate how complex climate data can be effectively summarized into tangible information that can be easily interpreted by anyone. Of course, the climate scenarios that we have used are based on predictions from a few climate models, run under a single (business as usual) climate scenario. We recognize that these models are characterized by huge amounts of uncertainty [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the predicted Future Cities may change as these Earth System Models are refined, in particular in light of urban climate specificities [<xref rid="pone.0217592.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, our results are likely to reflect the qualitative direction of climate changes within cities and so meet our primary goal, which is to communicate predicted climate changes to a non-specialist audience in order to motivate action. When model projections are updated, we would recommend communicating any new results with this goal in mind.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our knowledge, our study represents the first global analysis of the shifts in climate conditions of the world&#x02019;s major cities under climate change. Our analysis revealed that over 77% of the world&#x02019;s cities are likely to experience a shift towards the climate conditions of another major city by 2050, while 22% will shift to climate conditions that are not currently present for any major cities on the planet. Across the globe, the direction of movement is generally trending towards the subtropics, providing unifying patterns that support trends observed in Europe and North America. In addition, this analysis revealed new insights for cities in equatorial regions, many of which are likely to move to entirely new climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any of the other global cities today. These city analogues, and the data we openly share, can help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, facilitating efforts to establish targeted climate response strategies. As well as facilitating our basic understanding of climate change effects, our analysis highlights the value of using cities to visualize the tangible effects of climate change across the globe.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217592.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dissimilarity between current and future climate of the major cities of the world.</title><p>The dissimilarity is expressed as the Euclidean distance matrix performed on the 4 main axes of the PCA analysis that summarizes the climate variation (19 bioclimatic variables) among the major cities of the world.</p><p>(ODS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0217592.s001.ods"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217592.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Summary statistics of the global analysis of city analogues.</title><p>The table provides the three cities for which current climate is the most similar to the future climate of each city.
