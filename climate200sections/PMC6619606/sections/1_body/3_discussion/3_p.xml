<p>While our findings are necessarily dependent on the methodology used to identify the climatic shifts, it is widely recognized that the choice of the metric to assess the similarity-dissimilarity of the climate conditions between cities has an extremely minor effect, compared to the choice of the climate model and scenario[
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. That is, our results are unlikely to be affected whatever method we use to calculate dissimilarity, as the variation between climate projections is far greater. Nonetheless, Mahony and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] highlighted the need to standardize the contribution of each climate variable to the dissimilarity matrix and to account for correlation between them to avoid any bias[
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, we address this using a scaled principal component analysis to summarize the main bioclimatic variations among the 520 major cities. This approach simply follows classic dissimilarity analysis recommendations for ecological studies[
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], applying an Euclidean distance matrix on the main dimensions of the principal component analysis to assess the similarity between cities. This method was preferred to the sigma-dissimilarity developed by Mahony and colleagues[
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for its simplicity and it broad use in ecological sciences.
