<p>In this study, we evaluate the global shifts in the climate conditions of cities by taking current climate data for the world’s 520 major cities (Current Cities), and project what they will most closely resemble in 2050 (Future Cities). Rather than describing the quantitative changes in climate variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we propose to quantify city climate analogs at a global scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], i.e. assessing which Current Cities will most closely resemble the climate conditions of Future Cities. To tackle previous limitations, we explore these patterns at a global scale using 19 bioclimatic variables, to include climate variability and seasonality in addition to climate averages.
