<p>Specifically, we aim to test three questions: (i) What proportion of the worldâ€™s major cities of the future most closely resemble their own current climate conditions 
 <italic>vs</italic>. the climate conditions of other cities in different geographic regions? (ii) What proportion of cities will experience novel climate conditions that are outside the range experiences by cities today? (iii) If cities do shift their climate conditions, is this spatial shift uniform in direction across the planet?
