 </sup> (averaged on 19-year long series, that is, 19 rice-growing seasons in 20 years of weather data in both hemispheres). We applied the impact study on rice yield at multiple sites using weather series obtained from different GCM × RCP × WG combinations. With three WGs, we could in particular estimate the relative weight of the uncertainties in the output with respect to the WG used.
