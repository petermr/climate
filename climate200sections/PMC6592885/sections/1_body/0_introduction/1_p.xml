 </sup>. Shifts in temperature and precipitation distributions, including extremes, are critically important for the analysis of agricultural

 </sup> and biological systems that incorporate complex, non-linear interactions at the soil-plant-atmosphere interface
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. To develop climate scenarios, multi-model ensembles of General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used, which define the uncertainty in projections resulting from structural differences in the GCMs, as well as uncertainties in variations of initial conditions or parameterizations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Future projections are based on alternative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), each of them describing a potential future greenhouse gas concentration trajectory during the 21st century
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. However, the direct use of climate predictions from GCMs is problematic because their coarse spatial resolution may result in biases and uncertainties at a local scale
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>, since GCMs that are used to project future climate scenarios provide gridded-area average simulations while the occurrence and intensity of extreme events strongly depend on local factors
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. Stochastic weather generators (WGs) are routinely integrated into ecological or agro-meteorological studies to extend or interpolate incomplete weather data series for analyzing the extent of climate impacts within simulation applications, for instance with hydrological

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, runoff
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, ecosystem
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, and crop yield models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. After calibration of site-specific parameters based on local weather data, WGs simulate synthetic daily weather time-series that are statistically similar to inputs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. In climate change studies, WGs are used to explore the effect of long-term changes in mean climate variables as well as changes in climatic variability and the frequency of extreme events
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Applications of WGs can also be found to downscale
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> values of precipitation and air temperature with coarse spatio-temporal resolution as simulated from GCMs, based on probability density functions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. By empirically associating local-scale variables with large-scale atmospheric variables produced by GCMs, WG-based downscaling techniques underpin studies on regional and local-scale impact assessments. With weather generation, changes to climate obtained from GCM × RCP combinations are employed to alter the generator parameters for the site baseline to generate synthetic daily weather data for the future
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Weather generation has the advantage of being faster to compute than dynamic downscaling approaches such as Regional Climate Models that are driven by GCM outputs
