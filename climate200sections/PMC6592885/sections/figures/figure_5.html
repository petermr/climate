 <caption> Probability to have the same density distribution for different climate indices. Color lines indicate weather generators (C: CLIMAK; L: LARS-WG; W: WeaGETS) whereas line styles correspond to sites (ISO 3166 labels). ( a) Overlapping areas of probability density distributions of different monthly-based climate indices (radial axes, labelled in Supplementary Information) derived from different WGs for each Site × GCM × RCP combination. Solid black line indicates perfect fit of different combination GCM × RCP generated by the same WG for the same Site. The closer the lines to one, the smaller the difference between GCM × RCP combinations. In ( b) Overall density similarity across indices for GCM × RCP combinations at each site using different generators. </caption>
