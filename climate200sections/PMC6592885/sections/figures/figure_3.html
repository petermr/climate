 <caption> Agreement between generated and reference baselines. Line colors indicate weather generators (WG; C: CLIMAK; L: LARS-WG; W: WeaGETS), whereas line style corresponds to sites. ( a) Overall fit of weather series for each index (one monthly index for each axis with code labels as reported in Supplementary Information); solid black lines indicate perfect fit to reference data. ( b) Distribution density of the fit of all the indices analyzed (the closer to one, the more the whole set of reference distributions is reproduced by the WGs). </caption>
