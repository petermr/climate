<p>We find that most fisheries [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in our study will experience reductions in catch potential (&gt; 1% decrease) due to a limited ability to adapt to climate driven spatial range shifts (
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Mahi-mahi is expected to have the largest catch reductions (-27%) followed by Pacific sardine (-24%), jumbo squid and black tip shark (-23%), and red snapper (-21%). The six fisheries that are not expected to experience a reduction in potential catch due to climate driven shifts are triggerfish, Pacific hake, lion-paw clam, black murex snail, Gulf corvina, and brown swimming crab.
