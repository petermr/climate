<p>We estimated long-term changes in productivity and catch potential due to climate change for the 25 stocks (
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). For productivity, expected changes range from negative to positive. Pacific abalone is expected to have the largest negative relative change (-35%), cannonball jellyfish is expected to have the largest positive change (10%), and several species, including black tip sharks, black murex snail, and brown swimming crab are expected to experience little change (i.e., &lt; 1% change).
