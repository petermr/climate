 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Maximum potential catch at the end of the thirty-year time horizon is on average 14% lower than initial maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the stocks in our study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222317.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Pacific abalone experiences the greatest declines (-44%), while cannonball jellyfish is the only stocks that experiences an increase (4%). The majority of stocks (84%) experience declines in maximum catch potential greater than 1% over the time horizon.
