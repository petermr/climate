 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which subsequently affects marine species by altering biogeochemical cycles, trophic flows, as well as species life histories, productivity, and distributions [

 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well documented that marine populations have spatially shifted in response to increases in ocean temperature [

These shifts may further jeopardize vital food sources and livelihoods for people who rely on fisheries, particularly in regions where declines from overfishing are already occurring. Stocks are projected to decline in productivity, and it is predicted that species will spatially shift poleward and deeper where they may become inaccessible to those fishers who have fished for them historically [
