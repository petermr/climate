<p>The status quo (SQ) management policy simply maintains the current fishing mortality rate for each fishery (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>SQ</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>). The management policy that achieves optimal economic output (Opt) results in the greatest net-present value of profits (i.e., the sum of all discounted future profits) under current climatic conditions. This policy is determined using a dynamic optimization routine for each stock. Unlike the SQ management scenario, the fishing mortality rate in the Opt scenario is not constant, but a function of how much biomass is in the water. This policy enables a reduction in fishing effort when the stock is depleted, and an increase in fishing effort when the stock is healthy.
