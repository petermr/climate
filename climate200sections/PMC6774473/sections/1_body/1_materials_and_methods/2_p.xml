<p>Our study analyzed 25 fished stocks, which together account for over 70% of Mexico’s total landings in 2012 and are representative of different climatic regions and ecological environments. The stocks considered in the present study include four stocks targeted by industrial fisheries using large vessels with automated equipment, sixteen stocks targeted by artisanal fisheries from small (&lt;11 m length) boats or pangas, and five stocks shared by industrial and artisanal fleets (referred to as “mixed”) (
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All fisheries are managed nationally, with the exception of yellowfin tuna, which is managed by international management bodies. Although the yellowfin tuna fishery experiences foreign fishing pressure, we do not separate this from domestic fishing pressure in order to preserve stock dynamics.
