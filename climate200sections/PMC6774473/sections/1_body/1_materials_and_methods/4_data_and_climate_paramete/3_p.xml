<p>Based on the information summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> regarding expected climate change impacts on fish and invertebrates in Mexico, we identified environmental drivers of range shifts and changes in population growth rate. In addition, we included socioeconomic drivers that can influence adaptability to spatial shifts. Environmental factors that impact growth (
 <italic>g</italic>) are temperature rise, acidification, disease outbreaks, sea level rise, and freshwater inflow. Environmental factors that influence range shifts (
 <italic>K</italic>) are sea level rise, freshwater inflow, and migration. Catchability and governance are socioeconomic factors that influence adaptive capacity to range shifts.
