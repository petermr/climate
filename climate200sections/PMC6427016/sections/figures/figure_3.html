 <caption> Spatially-averaged temperature evolutions over the Mont-Blanc Massif for Tn and Tx and for summer and winter seasons. The spatial domain used for computation is that shown in Fig.  2. Black curves: spatially interpolated observations, period 1979–2014. Blue colours: historical (HIST) simulations, period 1850–2005. The solid curve shows the ensemble mean, the colour shading extends to ± 1 standard deviation to show model uncertainties. Green colours: the same for RCP2.6 simulations, period 2006–2100. Red colours: the same for RCP8.5 simulations, period 2006–2100. </caption>
