<p id="Par9">A frost event is defined as a day for which Tn &lt; 0 °C for morning frost, or Tx &lt; 0 °C for afternoon (permanent) frost. Frost frequency (in %) is obtained as the ratio between the number of frost events and the total length of the period. Frost evolutions under climate change consist in differences between future and current frost frequencies and are thus expressed as percentage points (pp). The statistical downscaling

Temperature biases are inherited from both the CMIP5 model and the statistical downscaling: see Supplementary Information and methodological paper
