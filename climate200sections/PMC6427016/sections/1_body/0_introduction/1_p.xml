<p id="Par2">The vulnerability of temperate mountain ranges to global warming is partly related to their elevation

 <sup>2</sup> peak above 4000 m but only 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> above 4500 m. This raises the question of the availability of so-called climatic shelters, that is, areas where the ecosystems can migrate to remain in environmental conditions favourable to their development

 </sup>. In the plains of the mid-latitudes, a rise of 0.6 °C typically corresponds to a poleward shift of one latitude degree (about 111 km). In the temperate mountain ranges, this corresponds to a vertical shift of 100 m only

 </sup>. A warming of several Celsius degrees, as estimated by the fifth assessment report of the IPCC, could thus lead to a general migration of several hundreds of meters vertically, and cause a dramatic transformation of high-mountain environments

 </sup>. In high elevations, temperature remains negative almost constantly, favouring snow accumulation and permafrost in non glaciated areas
