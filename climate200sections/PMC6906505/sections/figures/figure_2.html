 <caption> Simulated descending motion anomalies in response to each forcing. Middle troposphere ( σ = 0.550) omega anomalies (shading; Pa s −1) averaged over 25–29 days of model simulation in response to the ( a) SASM, ( b) EASM, ( c) Atlantic, and ( d) African forcings. Maps were generated using GrADS version 1.9b4 (http://grads.iges.org/grads/). </caption>
