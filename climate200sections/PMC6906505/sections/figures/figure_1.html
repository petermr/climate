 <caption> Multi-model ensemble-mean descending motion and P-E for climatology and future change during summer. ( a) Spatial pattern of 500-hPa omega climatology (black contour; Pa s −1) and future change (shading; Pa s −1) for the seven-model ensemble-mean in boreal summer. ( b) The same as in ( a) but for the P-E (mm day −1). The contour intervals are 0.02 Pa s −1 in ( a) and 1 mm day −1 in ( b). Green dots in ( a,b) indicate the points where more than 85% of the models agree on the sign of the mean for future change. In ( a,b) maps were generated by GrADS version 1.9b4 (http://grads.iges.org/grads/). </caption>
