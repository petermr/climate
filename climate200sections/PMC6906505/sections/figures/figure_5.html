 <caption> Remote control mechanisms for the heating over the western Mediterranean. Schematic illustrating the ( a) monsoonâ€“desert teleconnection and ( b) northeastward wave energy propagation. Red (blue) shading ellipses indicate the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation. Black line boxes show the SASM, EASM, and Atlantic forcings. The Gill-type Rossby wave response to the SASM and EASM forcings is denoted by yellow line in ( a) and the northeastward wave route emanated from the Atlantic forcing is shown as blue line in ( b). The maps were created using the NCAR Command Language Version 6.4.0 ( http://www.ncl.ucar.edu). </caption>
