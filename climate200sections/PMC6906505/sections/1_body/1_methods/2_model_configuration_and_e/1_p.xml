 </sup>. The model has a horizontal resolution of T42 and 20 vertical levels in sigma coordinates (available online at http://ccsr.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lbm/sub/lbm.html). The 20C JJA mean state for the LBM is prescribed from the average of the seven-model simulations. To investigate physical mechanisms that cause the changes in the Mediterranean atmospheric circulation, the LBM experiments are performed using the heating profile for a different region. The heating is estimated

 </sup> as a residual of the thermodynamic equation for the average of the seven-models. The four potential heating or cooling profiles are the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM; 75°–115° E, 0–40° N and 50°–75° E, 0–15° N), East Asian summer monsoon (EASM; 115°–180° E, 20°–50° N), Atlantic (AT; 45°–10° W, 10° S–10° N), and African (AF; 10° W–40° E, 0–15° N) regions (Supplementary Fig.
