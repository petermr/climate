 </sup> are used in this study: CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CM, GFDL-CM3, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, NorESM1-M. These models have captured the relationship between monsoon diabatic heating and descending motion in the Mediterranean

 </sup>. Results from other CMIP5 model are comparable to those of the seven models listed above (not shown). All datasets provide monthly mean data with a 2.5° × 2.5° longitude-latitude grid at 17 vertical pressure levels for the variables. The model output can be obtained from the CMIP5 archive website,

The analyses are performed using the ensemble mean of the seven CMIP5 models for JJA. The present (future) climate is the 20 years of the historical (RCP8.5) simulation from 1986 to 2005 (from 2081 to 2100) and is referred to as 20C (21C). The future change is also denoted by 21C minus 20C.
