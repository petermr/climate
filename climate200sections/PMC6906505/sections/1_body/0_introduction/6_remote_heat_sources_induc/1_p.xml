<p id="Par7">The SASM has been considered a major remote forcing component inducing changes in the Mediterranean climate. However, this is not the only forcing source. To identify what additional heat sources are responsible for the atmospheric circulation change over the Mediterranean, the numerical experiments using Linear Balance Model (LBM) are performed. The input diabatic heating or cooling profiles are taken from the simulation outputs for the regions denoting the SASM, EASM, Atlantic, and Africa (indicated by the boxes in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>). The omega anomalies in the middle-troposphere (
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0.550) for the near steady state (which is achieved by the average over 25–29 day integration outputs) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for different heat sources. The results are not sensitive to the addition or exclusion of a few days after the 15-day integrations. The omega anomalies over 30°–40° N for the SASM forcing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) show the generally similar zonal pattern to that of the 21 C CMIP5 omega changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) with positive anomaly over the WM and negative one over the nearby EM, although these two anomalies are shifted by 5° to the left. The EASM forcing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) exhibits the similar dipole pattern with the SASM case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), however with a weaker magnitude. This similarity comes from the use of the analogous heating profile between the two, which is top-heavy with strong heating in the upper troposphere and weak heating in the lower troposphere (blue and red lines in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).
