<p id="Par6">The changes in the 500-hPa vertical wind (omega) and precipitation minus evaporation (P–E) during June–July–August (JJA) between the present climate (20 C) and future climate (21 C) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The climatological downward motion (corresponding to positive omega, black contour in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) is grossly located over 25°–45° N in the boreal summer. In particular, the descending motion over the EM (20°–40° E) is much stronger than that over other regions along 35° N. The climatological P–E value is negative across this subsidence region, implying a dry and warm climate, except in the Alps

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). On the other hand, future changes (shaded in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) demonstrate the positive omega anomalies over the WM (5°–20° E) but the negative omega anomalies over the EM. The result reveals that the descending motion would become stronger in the WM but with weaker descending motion in the EM in the future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), which is in agreement with a previous study

 </sup>. The circulation change tends to drive the gross feature of the P–E change; the drier atmosphere over the WM and the wetter one over the EM, although the latter P–E signal is weaker

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, widespread downward motion anomalies are seen along 40°–50° N (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), indicating the poleward shift in the subtropical dry zone under warmer climate conditions
