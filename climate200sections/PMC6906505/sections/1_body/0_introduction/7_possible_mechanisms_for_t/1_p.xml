<p id="Par11">To elucidate the physical processes of the Mediterranean circulation changes, the streamfunction anomalies for the SASM, EASM, and Atlantic forcing experiments are plotted (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The SASM and EASM experiments show that the anticyclonic circulation anomalies at the upper level expand westward into the Mediterranean from each of the forcing regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,c</xref>). This westward expansion is possible along the jet stream over the Eurasia region (10°–120° E, 30°–40° N) as shown in the Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3a</xref>. The jet stream area is associated with the large climatological meridional vorticity gradient which is proportional to the upper zonal wind (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3a,c</xref>). It is likely that on the left (right) side of the local anticyclonic circulation anomaly, air with a lower (higher) planetary vorticity is advected from the south (north), enhancing (counteracting) the existing local vorticity
