<p id="Par12">In the lower troposphere, in response to the positive heating associated with the Asian monsoon precipitation, cyclonic circulation anomalies are formed near the forcing regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b,d</xref>), whereas anticyclonic circulation anomalies (albeit somewhat smaller) are developed over the northwestern part of Africa. The latter part of the circulation signal is barotropic if the upper-level circulation anomalies are considered together. By contrast, at the forcing region and its immediate western vicinity the baroclinic vertical structure is evident since the both forcings have the top-heavy diabatic heating profiles. The baroclinic spatial patterns are consistent with the structure of the monsoon–desert teleconnection pattern

 </sup>, in which remote diabatic heating induces the low-level cyclonic circulation response to the west – then in combination with the upper-level anticyclonic circulation anomaly. This results in the development of warm temperature anomalies in the middle troposphere through the hydrostatic balance, stretching toward the Mediterranean. This thermal structure signifies the deepening of isentropic surface or the convex structure in this surface; then subsequently the descending motion is produced to the west of the curved isentropic surface along 35°–40° N, where the climatological winds are westerlies (orange shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,c</xref>); therefore, the adiabatic subsidence occurs over the WM.
