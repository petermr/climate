<p id="Par3">Summer climate over the Mediterranean is characterized by hot/warm and dry conditions with a descending motion

 </sup>, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, the large-scale atmospheric circulation in South Asia is revealed to mostly influence the summer climate and weather of the Mediterranean via atmospheric teleconnection. This teleconnection is known as the monsoon–desert mechanism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, in which remote diabatic heating formed by the SASM rainfall generates the descending motion over the Mediterranean and nearby region through a westward-propagating Rossby wave. Therefore, it is important to understand how the monsoon–desert process influences the Mediterranean summer weather and the atmospheric circulation in the Mediterranean region under global warming. A more detailed understanding would improve the seasonal predictability skill and climate simulation for the Mediterranean and Europe in the boreal summer
