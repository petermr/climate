<p>Three studies examined genetic aspects of host resistance to climate changes and herbivore attack.

Among several findings, they reported that during extreme drought, arthropod community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled susceptible trees, indicating composition was strongly influenced by tree genetics independent of tree architecture. However, under moderate drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled resistant trees, indicating traits associated with tree architecture became more important.

Both oak populations were genetically variable, but no clear genetic pattern for feeding preference emerged. Contrary to field observations, larvae preferred seedlings from the source area where severe damage by cockchafer does not occur. Larvae feeding preference was thought to be driven by root-released volatile terpenes and benzenoids, and the authors identified five oak terpene synthase genes with geographically structured expression patterns. Finally,

They compared sequence repeats from surviving trees to those of the general tree populations and identified segregation among these tree groups that supports a genetic basis to survivorship.
