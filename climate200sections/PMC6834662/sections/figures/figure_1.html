 <caption> Spatio-temporal patterns in climatic data along the distributional range of the different snowfinch species (genera Montifringilla, Pyrgilauda and Onychrostruthus) 47 . Orange tonalities represent the increase of mean temperature (Â°C/10 years, estimated as the slope of the linear regression of the mean temperature over the years) in the different areas. Temperature data retrieved from the Global Historical Climatology Network 46 (GHCN-Monthly version 2, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). Numbers in brackets represent the specimens of each species measured in the collections. Drawings: Giulia Bombieri. </caption>
