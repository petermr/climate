<p id="Par12">We visited natural history museums and collections worldwide (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) to quantify temporal changes in size and melanin-based colouration in 447 skin specimens of snowfinches. For each specimen, we measured the spectral reflectance of two melanic patches (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), corresponding to the black and brown coloured upper parts. Previous studies have demonstrated the biological significance of melanin-based colouration, as it might affect fitness via their influence on reproduction and survival through process that include thermoregulation, energetics, fecundity, sexual selection, competition and predation

 </sup>. To analyse the variation of melanin-based colouration, we needed to extract variables that summarise the chromatic variation captured in the spectral reflectance. One of the most commonly used method consists on computing indices that describe the spectral shape

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. We computed the saturation and the brightness of the melanin-based colouration, which represent different aspects of the chromatic variation. In particular, saturation refers to the spectral purity of a colour, and brightness refers to the perceived intensity of a stimulus. To explore the possibility that the age of museum specimens contributed to colour differences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, we selected three species of snowfinches inhabiting areas where temperature has increased at a different rate (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), and regressed colour features against the year. We selected the same period of time, from 1902 to 1945, for which we had data for all these three species. Even though the selected individuals were collected and stored during the similar time period, their colour features have shifted at dissimilar rates (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The observed shift of colour features was indeed related to the shift in temperature. Thus, we excluded the possibility that differences in plumage colouration might have resulted from degradation over time. In addition, as a surrogate of body size, we measured tarsus, wing and bill lengths of each bird, and from the specimen’s label we took the sex (when available, see Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) as well as the locality where the specimen was collected. Researchers are generally not in agreement on what single morphometric measurement would best reflect body size, if any
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Previous studies have shown that body size is best quantified using a combination of skeletal measurements, being wing and tarsus length often considered
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. However, morphometric variables might show an allometric relation, changing the proportion of these traits with size. We assessed the extent of allometry between tarsus and wing length within species and found a non-significant coefficient, with slope being smaller than 1 (0.019 ± 0.012[SE]). Hence, the allometry effect was either absent or small. We first performed phylogenetic analyses to account for the relatedness of species. Even though snowfinches differ in their morphological and melanic colour features (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), the structure of the phylogeny alone did not explain the observed variation in morphometric and colouration traits (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). To evaluate the effect of climate change, and using the spatial coordinates of each specimen, we selected the closest weather station (data retrieved from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Monthly version 2,
