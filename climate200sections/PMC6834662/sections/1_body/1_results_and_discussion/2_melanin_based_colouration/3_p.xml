 </sup>. Dispersing away from deteriorating habitat is one of the most recognisable responses to environmental change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, escape is not always possible for all organisms, such that genetic evolution to the new local conditions and phenotypic plasticity are key adaptive responses for maintaining many aspects of biodiversity in a changing world
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. This might be especially the case in alpine environments. To date, there have been very few cases answering the question of whether ecotypic changes represent genetic responses (i.e. evolution) or phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in weather conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. Documenting genetic change requires testing for changes of allele frequencies in genes functionally linked to ecotypic traits, or to apply quantitative genetic approaches to estimate trait heritability

 </sup>. Yet, the relevant genes that encode ecotypic traits in snowfinch (sub)species are still unknown. As in most other species, we expect multiple genes to be involved, which adds another piece of difficulty to the task. More studies are needed for improving our knowledge on the genetic basis of colour variation in order to understand the evolution of colour phenotypes
