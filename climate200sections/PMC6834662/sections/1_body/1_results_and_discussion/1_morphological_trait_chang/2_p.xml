 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> proposed that body size changes will be mediated by to two ecological factors, namely water and nutrient limitation that, ultimately, may lead to evolutionary responses favouring smaller individuals. However, whether body size shifts reflect local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity is still an open debate. Direct evidences for evolutionary responses to climate change are scarce, especially because for most taxa there is no information on which are the relevant genes encoding body size
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, further studies isolating the ultimate and proximate causes, and potentially providing insights into the physiological consequences of changes in body size, are important to improve our understanding on the potential of species to respond to climate change. Body size is a key biological parameter
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, influencing many aspects of an individuals’ life from the rates of energy acquisition and expenditure to the surface-to-volume ratio and food size. A change in size is thus likely to have important physiological and ecological consequences for an animal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, the fact that tarsus length and climate change are correlated provides no evidence on the underlying mechanisms. For example, it might be possible that variation in size is directly related to climate change, but it can also be that body size variation is related to changes in resource availability that depends on climate conditions across different geographical regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. We observed that bill length, a morphometric feature highly related with changes in diet
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), has also decreased through time. However, when relating variation in bill length with climatic factors, the models had generally low support (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2E</xref>), suggesting that the cause of variation in snowfinch size may not be entirely explained by changes in food resource
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. An alternative hypothesis is that body size variations may be related to changes in the metabolism rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. The metabolic rate exponentially scales with body mass and temperature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. For cold adapted alpine bird species, an increase in their metabolic rates due to an increase of ambient temperature may cause a severe decrease in their performance. By decreasing the body size, snowfinches might be compensating the expected increase of their metabolisms associated with the current warming trend observed in the alpine areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
