<p>The experiment consisted of three stages. At Stage 0, all participants read the same original story (OS) about three politicians who set out to solve the climate change problem, but with very different strategies, leading to different consequences (see

At both points in time, there were four retelling conditions. Participants were either asked to recall the story in as complete a manner as possible (control condition without audience), or they were asked to retell the story to an audience holding a specific world view, that is, to a person who was depicted as either a typical individualist, hierarchist, or egalitarian. At the end of Stage 2, a questionnaire was administered measuring the participantâ€™s world view. Based on this questionnaire, participants were clustered into three distinct world view groups, representing individualism, hierarchism, or egalitarianism.
