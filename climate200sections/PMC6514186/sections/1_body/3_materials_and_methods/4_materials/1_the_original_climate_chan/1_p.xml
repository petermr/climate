<p>The main stimulus material consisted of a text (604 words) about three politicians who set out to tackle the problem of climate change (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>). One character Tom Brown was portrayed as a conservative relying on a technical solution, closely corresponding to a hierarchist’s world view. A second character Matt Greene was portrayed as a left-wing politician with an egalitarian world view, trying to enforce stricter laws prohibiting unsustainable consumption. Bob Wayne, the third character, was portrayed as a free-market advocate with a typical individualist’s world view, who promoted establishing free trade so that market forces would eventually solve the climate change issue. All three politicians encountered serious problems trying to implement their strategies; when finally some success showed up, a dispute arose among the three characters about whose strategy it was that was effective. The story ended with all three politicians being assassinated (the reader may recognize a reminiscence of Bartlett’s classic story War of the Ghosts).
