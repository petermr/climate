<p>Based on the theoretical background outlined above, we assume that climate change stories are shaped by the world views of people who tell such stories, as well as by the world views of the audience to whom the stories are told. World views are assumed to work as 
 <italic>reconstruction filters</italic>, modifying stories when they are repeatedly told and retold. To our knowledge, the role of world views in memory and communicative processes in the context of climate change has not yet been studied. The investigation of audience world views and their interaction with speakersâ€™ world views, in combination with applying computational text analysis, thus contributes to the novelty of this study.
