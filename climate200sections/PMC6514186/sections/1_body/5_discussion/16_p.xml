<p>Can memory processes explain echo chamber effects? If we view echo chambers as closed systems, that is, as a collection of like-minded individuals communicating only with each other, we would predict that any story would be distorted and fragmented over time, with little information remaining the same over time. However, the assumption that echo chambers operate as filter bubbles (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Flaxman et al., 2016</xref>), systematically extracting compatible and distorting incompatible information, might be too strong. Our data indicate that the simple process of retelling, no matter to whom, generates a loss of information that is unsystematic. Furthermore, what we tentatively called a common ground hypothesis suggests that like-minded individuals have no motive to systematically reconstruct the stories that they tell each other, simply because they are like-minded and share a common world view in the first place. In contrast, when confronted with individuals from a different echo chamber, some adjustments in communicated content might well occur; our findings suggest that at least the key components of a story – Who is the villain? Who caused the problem? – might be constructed according to the speaker’s and the listener’s world views. These effects were small, though, in our study and they have also typically been small in other research (

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Quattrociocchi et al., 2016</xref>). The existence of echo chambers appears to be an obvious phenomenon, and there is evidence that people tend to engage in social media activities with like-minded others, albeit not exclusively so (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Flaxman et al., 2016</xref>). However, tapping into the specific processes that may lead to increasing polarization between echo chambers through transformation of discourse content, and studying these processes in a systematic scientific manner, may be more challenging than anticipated.
