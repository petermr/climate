<p>The present study shows that world views exert a small though non-negligible influence on how climate change narratives are remembered and retold. An examination of the mental representation of a climate change story via a sorting task/cluster analysis approach revealed that although the general story structure is very similar across world views, the link between the problem component (a crisis due to climate change) and the proposed problem solutions (strategies to counteract climate change) varies systematically as a function of the audience’s world view and of the speaker’s world view. The audience effect indicates that speakers tune the retelling to the audience’s world view and connect the problem with that solution which is preferred by the audience; for example, retelling the story to an egalitarian who is assumed to prefer a sustainable strategy yields a close association between crisis and sustainable strategy. Also, the egalitarian structure contrasts to both the individualist and the hierarchist structure, the latter two being both more closely associated with a non-sustainable solution.</p>
