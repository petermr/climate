<p>Several limitations of this study should be noted. The validity and reliability of narrative analyses has often been questioned (

After normalization, the mean number of words of a text unit was about 40, whereas the original story had approximately 600 words; some retellings consisted of just a few words. This constitutes an enormous loss of information that cannot be explained by a systematic influence of schemata on the reconstruction. The similarities between retellings and the original story are generally very low and the signal/noise ratio might be too low to detect substantial effects; especially when splitting the retellings according to the three story lines, this effect might be exacerbated. It may be questioned whether a completely open response format is capable of capturing the conceptual content of peoples’ recollection with sufficiently high precision; it may be that the requirement to articulate and write down one’s recollection simply generates a large amount of noise. Also, measuring similarity via a cosine similarity measure based on common word frequencies has its drawbacks. For example, in some conditions participants might rephrase the original wording using synonyms, which would lead to low similarity just because different words are used for the same concepts.
