<p>The similarity analyses yielded a time effect, but only in the somewhat trivial sense that people forget when time passes. We found an audience effect, but that was unspecific: in the control condition, when participants simply recalled the original story without telling it to an audience, retellings were most similar to the original story. If an audience was present, retellings decreased in their similarity to the original story, but more or less to the same degree across the various audiences, irrespective of the specific world view held by the listener. In fact, the decay over time was not significant for the control/recall condition. We assume that world views of an audience do in fact operate as filters, but in an unspecific manner, introducing alterations and omissions unrelated to the audienceâ€™s specific world view, and distorting the original information in a somewhat random way. This finding suggests that talking to an audience of any kind activates a filter process so that the recollected story bears less resemblance to the original story than under pure recall without an audience. This is counter to our schema conformity hypothesis, which states that if speaker and listener share the same world view the filter effect would be amplified.</p>
