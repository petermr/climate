<p>The effect of the speaker’s world view, in contrast, indicates that speakers tend to connect the aspects of the crisis with that strategy which – from their point of view – is the cause and culprit of the crisis. Thus, unlike the audience effect, which links the crisis with a solution, the effect of the participant’s world view is to link the crisis with the problem. Participants with an egalitarian world view closely associate the crisis with the free market, and with the respective protagonists. An individualistic participant, in contrast, associates the crisis with sustainable strategies. In sum, the findings from the cluster analyses suggest that the reteller’s world view links the story problem with the ‘villain’ (as seen from the reteller’s world view), whereas the audience effect tends to make the retelling compatible with the solution as seen from the audience’s world view.</p>
