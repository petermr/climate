<p>The dictionary analysis largely confirms the findings from the similarity analysis. The pattern of word counts for different term categories does not support the hypothesis that those terms are recollected relatively more often which conform to the participant’s world view or to the audience’s world view. Instead, we find the opposite – no interaction between Term Category and World View, and the interaction between Audience and Term Category yields greater proportions for the control condition with respect to all categories, which is again in line with assuming an unspecific filter mechanism. In addition, the dictionary analysis shows virtually identical and very low proportions for all Audience conditions with respect to the crisis category. A plausible explanation might be that the crisis topic is a story feature that does not discriminate between the story characters and their strategies.</p>
