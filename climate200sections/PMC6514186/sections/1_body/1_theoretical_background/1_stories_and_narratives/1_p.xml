 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">McBeth et al., 2014</xref>) distinguishes a setting, a plot, characters, and a moral or a solution to a problem. The characters are categorized as villains causing the problem, as victims being harmed, and as heroes solving the problem. Related approaches can be found in text linguistics (
