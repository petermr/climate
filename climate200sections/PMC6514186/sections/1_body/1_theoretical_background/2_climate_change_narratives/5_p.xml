<p>Typically, the type of narrative people endorse and peopleâ€™s political orientations are correlated (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler, 2017</xref>). Individuals with a left-leaning political orientation (socialists, democrats, liberals, etc.) tend to show stronger belief that climate change is happening and caused by humans, and to show stronger support for strategies to mitigate climate change, than individuals with a right-leaning political orientation (conservatives, republicans, neo-liberal free-market advocates, etc.). We will take up the role of political orientations in the discussion.
