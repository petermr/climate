<p>As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, the main effect of Term Category is manifested in a slightly higher proportion of words for hierarchical words, 
 <italic>t</italic>(1782) = 8.63, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and individualistic words, 
 <italic>t</italic>(1782) = 5.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and a substantially lower proportion of words from the crisis category, 
 <italic>t</italic>(1782) = -15.16, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. For Audience, only the control condition differs significantly from the overall mean, 
 <italic>t</italic>(249) = 2.98, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; however, these findings are qualified by the significant interaction, indicating that all differences between audiences disappear for the Crisis condition.
