<p>Another approach to check whether a text is related to a specific topic or theme is dictionary analysis (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Welbers et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike similarity analysis, where similarity between two texts is defined across the entire vocabulary, dictionary analysis relies on a set of predefined words, and counts how often these words occur in a given text. If the collection of predefined words represents the essential meaning of a topic, a word count may serve as an indicator of how closely related the text is to the topic.
