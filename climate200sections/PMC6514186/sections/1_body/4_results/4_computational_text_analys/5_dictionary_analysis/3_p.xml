<p>We conducted a dictionary analysis using the four categories of words as shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Term Category was defined as a factor with four levels (individualistic, hierarchical, egalitarian, and crisis), each level referring to the words of that category. A word count yielded the frequency of terms from a Term Category included in a retelling. For counting, word stems were used (e. g., law
 <sup>âˆ—</sup> included all instances such as law, laws, lawful, etc.; computational details can be found in the analysis script available online). Each category consisted of eight terms, except the crisis category which comprised only five terms. To compensate, the word count for each category was inversely weighted by the number of category terms; these weighted counts entered in the following analyses.
