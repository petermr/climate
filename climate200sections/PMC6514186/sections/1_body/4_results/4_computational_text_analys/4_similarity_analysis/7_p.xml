<p>As expected, a significant effect of Time confirms that similarity to the original story generally declines over time (a 1 week interval). A simple effects analysis of Time across the levels of the Audience factor yields significant declines for the egalitarian condition, 
 <italic>t</italic>(65) = 2.52, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014, and the individualist condition, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 2.73, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008. The interaction effect between Audience and Time manifests as a significantly lower similarity at Stage 1 for the hierarchist condition, 
 <italic>t</italic> = -2.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011 (
