<p>Polarization may partly be attributable to so called ‘echo chambers’ or ‘filter bubbles’; these metaphors mainly refer to social media such as Facebook and Twitter, where like-minded individuals communicate with each other, reinforcing their respective stance and evaluation of climate change (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Jasny et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Retelling a story about climate change to people who essentially agree with one’s view may bolster this view in two ways: first, the speaker, holding world view X, adapts her retelling to her own world view; since the speaker and the listener hold the same world view, no conflict arises and the speaker’s statements are likely to be accepted and reinforced by the listener. Second, the speaker tunes her retelling to the listener’s world view X, and thus constructs a version that even more conforms to her own world view X. In a communication between like-minded, adaptation and tuning both enhance the correspondence between the communicators’ world views and the content of the communication. We propose that such processes of constructive memory may partly account for the ‘echo’ in echo chambers, and for the polarization of the climate change debate.
