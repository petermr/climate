 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of observed survival between species (Natterer's bats (
   <italic>Myotis nattereri</italic>, red points); Daubenton's bats (
   <italic>Myotis daubentonii</italic>, blue triangles)) in each period. Winter periods are denoted by “w” and the respective years, while summer periods are labeled as “s” combined with the respective year. Additionally, periods that describe summer survival are indicated by a light gray background. Vertical lines indicate 95% confidence intervals for the estimated survival probabilities. The stars in winter 2010/11 and summer 2012 indicate significant differences in observed survival (adults and juveniles combined) between species, see Table
