<p>In contrast to other studies (Culina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Monticelli et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), we found no consistent difference in survival between sexes in either species. For comparison, Culina and co‚Äêauthors reported a generally higher survival of females in Natterer's bats. The authors suggested higher costs for male Natterer's bats due to the polygamous mating system and, thus, a higher intensity on sexual selection for males (Culina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). If this is the case, it cannot be confirmed in our study populations.
