<p>A potential cause for these differences in the importance of specific periods for survival might be a species‐specific influence of weather conditions at different times of the year. Depending on the timing of unfavorable conditions and consequently low arthropod availability, bat species may be affected differently due to their distinctive foraging strategies and activity patterns (Culina et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Siemers et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Robinson and co‐authors found in seven out of ten bird species a positive correlation between survival and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO, December–March) with strong positive effects in four species (Robinson, Baillie, &amp; Crick, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The NAO, which is based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure between Lisbon, Portugal and Reykjavik, Iceland (Hurrell, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>), is described as a large‐scaled weather parameter for winter severity with negative values indicating cold and dry winters (Hurrell, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>; Post, Stenseth, Langvatn, &amp; Fromentin, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Interestingly, the winter 2010/2011 with an exceptionally low survival in Natterer's bats was one of the two winters in our study period that had negative NAO values (winter 2010/2011: −1.57; winter 2012/2013: −1.97 [Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35292-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>]; data were provided by the Climate Analysis Section, NCAR, Boulder, USA, Hurrell [2003, updated regularly; accessed 19th March 2018]). The monthly NAO indicated that in 2010 the December was particularly harsh. At this time of the winter, Natterer's bats are typically still active as indicated by a lot of activity at the hibernaculum according to the logger data (own unpublished data), and especially males try to accumulate their fat reserves very late in Natterer's bats (Kohyt, Rozik, Kozakiewicz, Pereswiet‐Soltan, &amp; Gubała, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In contrast, Daubenton's bats start to hibernate much earlier (own unpublished data) and thus should not have been affected by the cold conditions during that month. Winter 2012/2013 showed an even lower NAO value than winter 2010/2011 but unlike in the winter 2010/2011 in winter 2012/2013, the lowest NAO value was in March, the month when individuals of both species depart from the hibernaculum (own unpublished data). Thus, if bats die during that period, in our analyses, we would find a low survival for the summer 2013. This is the case in both species with the lowest estimated summer survival in summer 2013 in adults of both species (mn: 0.78 (
 <italic>SE</italic> ± 0.03); md: 0.69 (
 <italic>SE</italic> ± 0.01)). In conclusion, adverse weather conditions at different seasons might result in species‐specific responses, depending on their respective foraging strategy and hibernation phenology.
