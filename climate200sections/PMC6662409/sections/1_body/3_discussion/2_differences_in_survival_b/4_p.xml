<p>After excluding the winter 2010/2011 with an exceptional population crash in Natterer's bats, the data revealed a stable seasonal survival pattern that varied in severity across years for adult bats in both species. Even though our study species are both of small body size, winter survival was significantly higher than summer survival in both of them. This is in contrast to the concept of summer‐ and winter‐regulated bird populations (Blumstein &amp; Fernández‐Juricic, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>) but it is in line with what has been described for mammalian hibernators (Turbill et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The difference in seasonal survival in adult Natterer's bats (estimated summer survival: 0.78–0.86; estimated winter survival: 0.91–0.95) was smaller than the respective difference in adult Daubenton's bats (estimated summer survival: 0.69–0.84; estimated winter survival: 0.95–0.98). Adult Daubenton's bats had slightly lower survival rates during summer and higher survival rates during winter, than adult Natterer's bats each year. This is in line with our prediction with regard to their different foraging strategies and activity patterns during the hibernation period (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35292-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). The consistently switching seasonal pattern when comparing both species (adult survival in winter: mn &lt; md; in summer: mn &gt; md) might indicate a different season‐specific sensibility of the two species to unfavorable conditions. The population crash of Natterer's bats occurring in a winter (2010/2011) and the lowest survival probabilities in Daubenton's bats occurring during two summers (2012 and 2013; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), additionally, suggests a species‐specific sensibility to the timing of unfavorable conditions.
