<p>In accordance with the known longevity of both of our study species (Dietz, Nill, &amp; Helversen, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Wilkinson &amp; Munshi‐South, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>), we found no consistent difference in observed survival between Natterer's bats (range in the different periods: 0.37–0.89) and Daubenton's bats (0.70–0.93) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which was also evident in the estimated survival (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, there were specific periods, namely winter 2010/2011 and summer 2012, in which the two species showed significant differences in survival. Both species had lower survival in the winter 2010/2011, but only Natterer's bats experienced a pronounced population crash during this winter with a survival of only 0.37 compared with 0.75–0.89 in the other periods. In southern Germany, Fleischer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) found that Bechstein's bats populations also crashed in the winter 2010/2011. The authors showed that the population dynamics in their 19‐year data set was driven by this single winter and concluded that rare catastrophic events have a major influence on population dynamics (Fleischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Our data suggest that this may also be the case for other bat species, albeit the pattern seems to be species‐specific as shown for Daubenton's bats that have been much less impacted by the winter 2010/2011, even though they used the same hibernaculum as the Natterer's bats.
