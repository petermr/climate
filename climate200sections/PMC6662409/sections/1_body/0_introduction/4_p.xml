<p>In comparison with other mammals of a similar body size, hibernating bats are exceptionally long‐lived (Munshi‐South &amp; Wilkinson,

 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). With their low annual reproductive output (Linton &amp; Macdonald, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), bats’ population dynamics are driven mainly by adult mortality (Fleischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Consequently, information on survival of hibernating bats which are, as bats in general, of high conservation concern (Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, 1992) is of particular importance in times of global climate change with an expected increase in temperatures, changed precipitation patterns, and a higher frequency of extreme weather events, which all may affect seasons differently (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
