<p>As in other studies on bats, we expected lower survival of bats during the first winter while adult bats were expected to have high survival rates during winter (Culina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Sendor &amp; Simon, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). We predicted differences in survival across adults of both species due to differences in hibernation strategy. As a consequence of their higher activity during the hibernation period, Natterer's bats are supposed to be highly sensitive to adverse weather conditions that result in low arthropod availability during winter. Because Daubenton's bats do not hunt during the hibernation period, they should be less affected by adverse weather conditions prevailing then. Instead, for successful hibernation, they rely entirely on the fat reserves built up during summer. Thus, Daubenton's bats should depend more strongly than Natterer's bats on good conditions (high arthropod availability) during summer to refill their energy reserves after hibernation and further on accumulate fat reserves for the subsequent hibernation period. As a consequence of the species‚Äêspecific demands, we expected differences in the seasonal survival pattern between Daubenton's bats and Natterer's bats.
