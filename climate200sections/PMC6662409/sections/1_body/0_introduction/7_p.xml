<p>In this study, we used a large individualized multiyear data set collected at a RFID‐monitored hibernaculum to investigate survival in two sympatric European bat species over five years. Thus, we had the valuable advantage (Clutton‐Brock &amp; Sheldon, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) of a multiyear data set with high recapture rates without disturbing the individuals unnecessarily that allowed us to account for individual variation in survival and included both sexes and different age classes. Our aim was to identify potential differences in the seasonal survival patterns of two sympatric bat species that live in the same environment during the hibernation period. Our two study species, Natterer's bats (
 <italic>Myotis nattereri</italic>, further on also referred to as mn) and Daubenton's bats (
 <italic>Myotis daubentonii</italic>, further on also referred to as md), hibernate in the same hibernaculum in North Rhine‐Westphalia (Stumpf et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Trappmann, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Both species are very long‐lived (maximum life‐span &gt; 20 years) (Wilkinson &amp; Munshi‐South, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) with females having one offspring per year at most (Linton &amp; Macdonald, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Despite their similar life history, the two species differ with respect to foraging strategy and activity pattern during the hibernation period. Daubenton's bats hunt above water, and there is no evidence for foraging during winter (Flavin, Biggane, Shiel, Smiddy, &amp; Fairley, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Kokurewicz, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Siemers, Dietz, Nill, &amp; Schnitzler, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). In contrast, Natterer's bats glean arthropods from surfaces (Andreas, Reiter, &amp; Benda, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Siemers, Kriner, Kaipf, Simon, &amp; Greif, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Siemers &amp; Schnitzler, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) and radio‐tracking data suggest that they feed during hibernation period (Hope et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Due to high site fidelity with respect to hibernacula in both of our study species (Steffens, Zöphel, &amp; Brockmann, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), we were able to follow individuals over a substantial part of their life and to quantify seasonal survival over several years.
