<p>Exemplary studies that tried to quantify mortality during hibernation in bats suggested a low winter mortality or at least one that is comparable to mortality during summer (Culina, Linton, &amp; Macdonald, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Fleischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Fritze &amp; Puechmaille, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Sendor &amp; Simon, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). However, these previous studies used different methods and sampling strategies, and their data are not easily comparable. Fritze and Puechmaille (
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) for example described very low baseline mortality during hibernation based on dead bat counts in hibernacula. The authors explain the low number of dead bats found in hibernacula either due to a high rate of survival during hibernation or that sampling once per year might not be suitable to discover the real mortality rate (Fritze &amp; Puechmaille, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In a different approach, Culina et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) used multistate capture–mark–recapture models based on ringing data of three different bat species at their summer roosts, covering seven years to show the effect of individual traits and selected weather parameters on survival. The authors found differences in survival across species and generally lower winter survival of juveniles (Culina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In again a different approach, Fleischer et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) used a large individualized data set spanning 19 years. This data set was based on summer records of Bechstein's bats (
 <italic>Myotis bechsteinii</italic>) that had been marked with individual RFID tags, in early and late summer. This study revealed that both summer and winter mortality is equally low in most years (≤10%) but that extreme mortality (&gt;50%) occurred during one winter (Fleischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
