<p>Seasonal survival is comparatively well studied in birds, due to the availability of long‐term studies of marked populations, high‐quality long‐term ringing data, and sophisticated statistical methods for survival analysis (Klaassen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Leyrer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Rockwell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In this field of research, the concept of summer‐ and winter‐regulated populations has been introduced some time ago (Blumstein &amp; Fernández‐Juricic, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). This concept states that in smaller species, populations tend to be regulated by high mortality during winter, while particularly in larger species, reproductive rates and high mortality during the breeding season determine population dynamics (Blumstein &amp; Fernández‐Juricic, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). This pattern, however, breaks down when hibernating mammals are considered. Hibernation is a strategy to overcome times of food or water shortage by means of a reduction in body temperature and thus energy consumption (Geiser, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and allows retirement into microhabitats with clement climate, such as burrows or caves. This special adaptation might enable even smaller‐sized species to reach low mortality levels during winter, counter to the above expectation. So far, only few studies were able to quantify seasonal variation in individual‐based mortality in long‐lived mammals, due to a paucity of suitable long‐term data sets (Fleischer, Gampe, Scheuerlein, &amp; Kerth, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Marra, Cohen, Loss, Rutter, &amp; Tonra, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Turbill, Bieber, &amp; Ruf, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The available studies, indeed, suggest that in hibernating animals, winter mortality does not exceed or is even lower than mortality during summer breeding season (Fleischer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Turbill et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
