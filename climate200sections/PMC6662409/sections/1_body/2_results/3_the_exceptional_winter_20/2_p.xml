<p>Winter 2010/11 evidently was an exceptional period for Natterer's bats (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and including this winter in the regression model inevitably would force the choice of the least parsimonious model, no matter whether the rest of the study period would allow a simpler model. We therefore built the regression model for this species from summer 2011 to summer 2015, excluding the exceptional winter 2010/11.
