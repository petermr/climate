<p>Significant differences in survival between the two species were only found in two periods: winter 2010/2011 and summer 2012 (Table

 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). While in winter 2010/2011 Natterer's bats showed a much lower survival than Daubenton's bats, in summer 2012 a contrasting pattern was detected. Otherwise, both species showed similar survival. Furthermore, a comparatively low survival in summer 2013 was similarly observed for both species. The observed differences in survival between species in the abovementioned periods indicated a potentially species‚Äêspecific sensitivity to certain environmental events and their timing.
