<p>For adults, survival during winter was significantly higher than during summer in both species. However, adult Natterer's bats consistently had higher survival rates compared with Daubenton's bats during summer, but had lower survival rates than Daubenton's bats during winter (Table

 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). So, the differences between summer and winter mortality were more pronounced in Daubenton's bats. Finally, juveniles in their first winter suffered from mortality that reduced their survival chances to levels even lower than the speciesâ€™ summer survival.
