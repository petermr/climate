<p>Since the presence of only one antenna per entrance did not allow us to directly distinguish between bats entering and exiting the hibernaculum, we separated the hibernation period (August–April) into an arrival period (August–December) and a departure period (January–April) based on activity patterns known from direct observations in the field, light barrier recordings, and the available RFID recordings (L. Grosche and F. Meier, unpublished data). Because of the bats’ very high fidelity to their hibernaculum (Steffens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), individuals were considered dead if they were not recorded within an entire hibernation period. Survival was coded as 0 if the individual was considered dead and as 1 if it was known to be alive. We cannot absolutely exclude emigration, but note that in our 5‐year study period of continuous monitoring at the hibernaculum “Brunnen Meyer,” only one out of 1,445 tagged individuals re‐occurred after not being recorded for a complete hibernation period. Additionally, in 13 years of bat surveillance only 24 out of 1,111 bats assigned dead according to our criteria re‐appeared at another RFID‐monitored hibernaculum in close proximity to the study site for at least one more year (L. Grosche and F. Meier, unpublished data). Nevertheless, to assure that individuals have indeed used the hibernaculum, we excluded those individuals from the analyses that had not been recorded either during the arrival or during the departure period of a given hibernation period, but re‐appeared later (mn: 62 out of 820 individuals (7.5%); md: 24 out of 625 individuals (3.8%), Table
