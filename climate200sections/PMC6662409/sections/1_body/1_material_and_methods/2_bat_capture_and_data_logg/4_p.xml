<p>Individuals, for whom the last recording was during an arrival period (but not again thereafter), consequently had survived the preceding summer but were assumed to have died in the following winter. Similarly, those bats that were recorded for the last time during a departure period had survived the preceding winter but were assumed to have died during the following summer period. In our study, “winter” (arrival at hibernaculum August–December) includes, depending on the species and sex, a more or less intensive autumn swarming period at the hibernaculum, and the hibernation itself, while “summer” (emergence from hibernaculum January‐April) includes the transfer flights from and to the hibernaculum, as well as the time in their summer habitat.</p>
