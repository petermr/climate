<p>To capture the impact of changing environmental conditions over the study period, models of increasing complexity were estimated. The simplest model included the binary covariate season (summer vs. winter), postulating a stable seasonal pattern in survival, but no interannual variation. The next more complex model allowed that each year could have its own level of mortality (categorical covariate with one level for each year) combined with an additive effect of season. This model describes a consistent summer‐to‐winter difference (on the logit scale) in survival, but on possibly different levels across years. The most flexible (and least parsimonious) model included a covariate that permits a different level of survival in each of the periods and forces no constant summer‐to‐winter relation. Note that this final model is formally equivalent to the model including a year‐by‐season interaction, but estimates are easier to interpret when coded as a single variable with a level for each period.</p>
