<p>With the exception of the exceptional winter 2010/2011 in Natterer's bats, our data revealed a stable seasonal difference in adult survival which varied in its severity across years in both species. Nevertheless, our data emphasize the importance of specific periods as potential drivers of population dynamics and suggest that at least in bats responses to global climate change might be species‐, population‐, and even age class‐specific. Environmental conditions that are advantageous for one species, population, or age class might be detrimental to others. Especially, the timing of adverse weather events might play an important role and needs to be further investigated in future studies in order to better understand population responses to global climate change. Clearly, this will also be a prerequisite for conservation.</p>
