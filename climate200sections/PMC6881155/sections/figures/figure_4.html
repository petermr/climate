 <caption> Magnitude of changes in agriculture and marine fisheries productivity and affected population size, according to two CO 2 emission scenarios. ( A and B) Radial diagrams show projected concomitant changes in agriculture and marine fisheries productivity, where the angle describes the relative contribution of each sector to overall change (0°, gain in agriculture only; 90°, gain in fisheries only; 180°, loss in agriculture only; 270°, loss in fisheries only) and thus describes win-win (green), lose-lose (red), and win-lose (orange and blue) exposure categories. Each diagram consists of two rings. The inner ring represents the overall magnitude of the projected changes, measured as the distance between each country’s projected change and the origin (i.e., no change) in an orthogonal coordinate system. The outer ring indicates human population projected to be living at each bearing by 2100. ( C) Alluvial diagram illustrates how the total number of people projected to experience win-win (green), win-lose (blue and orange), and lose-lose (red) situations varies according to the emission scenario. Numbers are in billions (summations may not be exact owing to rounding) and only account for the projected population by 2100. See fig. S1 for global maps of each exposure category and fig. S5 for model uncertainty surrounding these estimates. </caption>
