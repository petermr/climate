<p>Conversely, countries situated at high latitudes (e.g., Europe and North America)—where food, jobs, and revenue dependences on domestic agriculture and seafood production are generally lower—will experience losses of lower magnitude or even gains in some cases (e.g., Canada or Russia) under future climate conditions (
