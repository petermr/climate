<p>In some cases, cross-sector adaptation may be an option by diversifying away from negatively affected sectors and into positively affected ones (i.e., moving out of the loss and into the win sector in win-lose conditions). For example, some countries projected to experience losses in fisheries productivity by 2100 would experience gains in agriculture productivity (
