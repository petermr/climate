<p>Pathways for reducing exposure to the impacts of climate change through reduced greenhouse gas emissions should include global action and be long lasting to achieve the Paris Agreement targets (a pathway similar to RCP2.6), which can massively reduce human vulnerability to climate change impact on food production systems. Overwhelmingly, net gains (i.e., higher gains, lower losses, or losses to gains) from a successful climate mitigation strategy would prevail over net losses (i.e., higher losses, lower gains, or gains to losses) (

Most vulnerable countries, in particular, would experience the highest net productivity gains (mostly through lower losses), while least vulnerable countries would benefit less from emission reductions as they would generally experience lower net productivity gains and, in some cases, net productivity losses (
