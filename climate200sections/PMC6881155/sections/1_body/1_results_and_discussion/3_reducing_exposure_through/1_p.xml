<p>Vulnerability of both agriculture and fisheries to climate change can be greatly reduced if measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are taken rapidly. Under a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5), almost the entire world’s human population (~97%) is projected to be directly exposed to high levels of change in at least one food production sector by 2100 (outer ring in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and fig. S1). Additionally, 7.2 billion people (~90% of the world’s future population) would live in countries projected to be exposed to lose-lose conditions (i.e., productivity losses in both sectors). These countries generally have high sensitivity and weak adaptive capacity (fig. S1). In contrast, only 0.2 billion people (&lt;3% of the world’s projected population) would live in regions projected to experience a win-win situation under RCP8.5 (i.e., productivity gains in both sectors) by the end of this century (outer ring in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and fig. S1). Under a “strong carbon mitigation” scenario (i.e., RCP2.6), however, lose-lose situations would be reduced by a third, so ~60% of the world’s population, while win-win situations would increase by a third, so up to 5% of the world’s population, mostly because of improved agricultural productivity (
