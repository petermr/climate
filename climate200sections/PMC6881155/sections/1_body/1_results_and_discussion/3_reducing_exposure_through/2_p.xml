<p>Although losses in productivity potential would be inevitable in many cases, the magnitude of these losses would be considerably lower under RCP2.6, notably for countries facing lose-lose conditions whose average change in productivity would move from about −25 to −5% for agriculture and from −60 to −15% for fisheries (see change in inner rings in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Main improvements would occur in Africa (all crops and marine fisheries), Asia (mostly marine fisheries and wheat), and South America (mostly wheat and soy), but also in Europe (mostly marine fisheries) and North America (mostly wheat and marine fisheries; fig. S6). Hence, although negative consequences of climate change cannot be fully avoided in some regions of the world such as Africa, Asia, and Oceania, they have the potential to be drastically lowered if mitigation actions are taken rapidly.
