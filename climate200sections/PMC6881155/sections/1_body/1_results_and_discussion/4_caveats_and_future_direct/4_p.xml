<p>Fourth, while we decided to limit the scope of our analysis to food production sectors for which global climate change projections were well developed, it is worth noting that different patterns of vulnerability may emerge if different sectors were included. Considering freshwater fisheries, for instance, would provide valuable insights into new opportunities (or challenges) in vulnerable countries that have a notable inland fishery sector (e.g., Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Guyana, or Bangladesh). The evidence so far seems to suggest that there is not much potential for increased inland fisheries productivity because of increased competition for waters and the current high proportion (90%) of inland catch coming from already stressed systems (

 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>)]—may be subject to the same constraints. The global potential of marine aquaculture production that does not rely on inputs from wild-capture feeds (i.e., shellfish) is expected to decline under climate change, although regions such as Southeast Asia may become more suitable in the future [fig. S9; (

 </xref>)]. For the livestock sector, decline in pasture productivity in many regions with notable broad-care grazing industry (e.g., Australia and South America; see relative changes in managed grass in fig. S4) combined with additional stresses (e.g., stock heat and water stress low-latitude regions, pests, and rainfall events) is likely to outweigh potential benefits, while disruption of major feed crops (e.g., maize; fig. S3) and marine fish stocks (

 </xref>). Overall, climate change impacts on other food production sectors indicate the potential for further negative impacts on the global food system, but analyses that integrate multiple sectors are still nascent and sorely needed (
