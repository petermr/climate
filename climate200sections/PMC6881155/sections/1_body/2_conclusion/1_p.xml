<p>The goal of this analysis has been to consider the many dimensions of multisector vulnerability to inform a transition toward more integrated climate policy. On the basis of our approach and models, we conclude that although lose-lose situations will be pervasive and profound, affecting several billion people in the most food-insecure regions, climate action can markedly minimize future impacts and benefit the overwhelming majority of the worldâ€™s population. We have shown that climate action can benefit both the most vulnerable countries and large greenhouse gas emitters to provide substantial incentives to collectively reduce global CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions. The future will nevertheless entail societal adaptation, which could include adjustments within and across food production sectors.
