<p>Similar to agriculture sensitivity, and in accordance with previous global assessment of human dependence on marine ecosystems (

 </xref>), sensitivity in the context of fisheries was assessed by combining indicators of the country-level contribution of fisheries to the economy (economic dependency), employment (job dependency), and food security (food dependency). We obtained the percentage of GDP contributed by reported and unreported seafood landings in 2014 from the Sea Around Us project (

  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>) to calculate the percentage of the workforce employed in fisheries and thus measure countriesâ€™ dependency on this sector for employment. Last, we used the food supply dataset from FAOSTAT (

 </xref>) to compute the fraction of consumed animal protein supplied by seafood and evaluate food dependency on fisheries.
