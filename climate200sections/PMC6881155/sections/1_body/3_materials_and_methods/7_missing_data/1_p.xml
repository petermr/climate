<p>The main data sources (table S1) allowed estimation of vulnerability for 84.8% of the world’s population. Territories and dependencies with missing data were assigned their sovereign’s values, which increased the total proportion of the population represented to 98.4%. Last, the remaining 1.6% was imputed using boosted regression trees to predict each individual indicator using all other indicators, with the exception of a few areas (&lt;0.1% of total population) for which one indicator (agriculture exposure) was not imputed because it could not be treated as a regression problem; i.e., it depends on future climatic conditions rather than on current countries’ socioeconomic and governance indicators.</p>
