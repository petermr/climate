<p>We draw from the vulnerability framework developed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) to assess human vulnerability to climate change impacts on agriculture and marine fisheries for, respectively, 240 and 194 countries, states, or territories (hereafter “countries”). We evaluated exposure by projecting changes in productivity of agriculture (maize, rice, soy, and wheat) and marine fisheries to the end of the century relative to contemporary values under two contrasting greenhouse gas emission scenarios (exposure): a “business-as-usual” scenario [Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)] and a strong mitigation scenario (RCP2.6). To generate a comprehensive index of vulnerability for agriculture and marine fisheries, we then integrated these models with socioeconomic data on countries’ dependency on each sector for food, economy, and employment (sensitivity) and the capacity to respond to climate impacts by mobilizing future assets (adaptive capacity) (
