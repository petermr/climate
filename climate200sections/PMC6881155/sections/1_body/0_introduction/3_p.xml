<p>In contrast to previous global studies on vulnerability that are focused on a single sector, our approach seeks to uncover how the different vulnerability dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of agriculture and marine fisheries interact and co-occur under future climate scenarios to derive priority areas for policy interventions and identify potential synergies or trade-offs. We examine the impacts of climate change on two global food production sectors that are key for livelihoods and food security globally (

 </xref>) and for which data were available with an acceptable degree of confidence. The likely impacts on other food sectors (aquaculture, freshwater fisheries, and livestock production), for which global climate change projections are less developed, are discussed only qualitatively but will be an important future research priority as climate projections on these sectors become more refined.
