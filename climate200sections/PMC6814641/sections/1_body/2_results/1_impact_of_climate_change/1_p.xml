<p id="Par37">The average simulated TN and TP loads from the BSDB were 540 thousand tons year
 <sup>−1</sup> and 29 thousand tons year
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, for the 2001–2010 period. The differences in the current fluxes to the Baltic Sea among the four CMs were minimal, about ± 2% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Discharge in the 2050s was projected to increase between 4% and 25% with an average increase of 16%. This increase is significantly higher than the variability in modelled flows under current climate due to the CM selection. Seasonal high flows are projected to increase, with peak flows happening earlier for the 2050s (See
