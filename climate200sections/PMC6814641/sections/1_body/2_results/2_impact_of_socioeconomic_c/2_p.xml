<p id="Par40">While all simulations that considered only changing climate resulted in a significant increase in both phosphorus and nitrogen loads (between 6 and 20% and between 4 and 9%, respectively), the combined impact from changing climate and socioeconomics resulted in either significant increases or significant decreases (from − 12 to 15% and from − 21 to 14% for phosphorus and nitrogen loads, respectively) depending on the assumptions concerning socioeconomic development. This significant finding highlights the importance of societal developments.</p>
