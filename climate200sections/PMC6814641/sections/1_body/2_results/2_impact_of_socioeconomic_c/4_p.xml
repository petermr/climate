<p id="Par42">The largest variability in projected TN load was observed in the Archipelago Sea where the average impact fluctuated between a 24% reduction under SSP1 and a 62% increase under SSP5, i.e. an overall variability of 86%. The Bothnian Bay was a notable exception in showing an increase in TN loads under SSP1, although this increase was very small (3%). The smallest variability in TN loads was projected for the Gulf of Riga where the impact fluctuated between a 6% reduction under SSP1 and a 12% increase for SSP5.</p>
