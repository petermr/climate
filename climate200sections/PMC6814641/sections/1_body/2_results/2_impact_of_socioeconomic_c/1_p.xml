<p id="Par39">The different socioeconomic conditions in the individual SSPs resulted in very different nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), especially for nitrogen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Under SSP1, the nitrogen and phosphorus loads decreased on average by 19% and 6%, respectively, relative to the current loads despite climate change impacts also being included in the simulations. On the other hand, nitrogen and phosphorus loads under SSP5 increased on average by 11% and 9%, respectively, relative to the current loads.
