<p id="Par53">The impact of changing climate on nutrient loads from the BSDB is projected to be rather substantial even by the 2050s. However, our findings suggest that regional changes in societal drivers of nutrient loading (e.g. changes in land use, agricultural practices or wastewater treatment efficiencies) can have effects that are as important as climate change for nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea. This is consistent with Eriksson HÃ¤gg et al. (
