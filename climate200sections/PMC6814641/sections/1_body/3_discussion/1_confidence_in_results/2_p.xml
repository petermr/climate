<p id="Par48">The average TP loads simulated with E-HYPE for the BSDB during 2001â€“2010 are practically the same as the total riverine loads reported by HELCOM (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) during the same period, with only a 4% difference between the two approaches. For average TN load, the difference of 14% still represents very good agreement considering the difference in approaches as well as the uncertainty in the monitored values.
