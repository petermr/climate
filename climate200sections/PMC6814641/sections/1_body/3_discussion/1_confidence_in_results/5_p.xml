<p id="Par51">E-HYPE recalibration changed the underlying nutrient processes significantly on a regional scale. However, the direction and the magnitude of the average projected changes are rather similar for the recalibrated and original E-HYPE models: 14% and 11% increase in TP load and 8% and 11% increase in TN load for the recalibrated and original E-HYPE models, respectively. The recalibration did affect the variability of the simulated changes for TN load, however. The range of climate impacts on TN load derived from the recalibrated model (5.3%) was only half of that under the original calibration (9.6%).</p>
