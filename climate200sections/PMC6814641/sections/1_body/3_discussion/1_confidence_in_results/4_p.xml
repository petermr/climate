<p id="Par50">The large range of projected impacts in 2050s presented in this study highlights the uncertainty surrounding CMs as the CMs projecting the lowest and the highest changes in precipitation and temperature were selected. It is difficult to say in advance which CM would lead to the most extreme nutrient load projections without actually running the full ensemble. The lowest (6%) and the highest (20%) projected changes in TP loads were found under CM1 and CM2, which feature the lowest and the highest projected change in precipitation and temperature, respectively. However, the highest projected change for TN load (10%) was found under CM3, which had the second highest change in precipitation but a relatively small change in temperature. The narrow range of loads and flows simulated for the current time period documented the adequacy of the DBS method for bias adjustments.</p>
