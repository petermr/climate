<p id="Par49">The modelling chain used in the experiment is a state-of-the-art procedure for climate impact assessments, yet it includes many well-documented sources of uncertainties (e.g. Bosshard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Olsson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). GCMs are dynamically downscaled to RCMs with further tailoring via downscaling and bias correction before using the climate data in hydrologic impact models with uncertainties present at each step. For example, Olesen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>) attributed large differences in the climate impact on TN loads in a Danish catchment (0–8% decrease vs. 23–63% increase) projected by two different hydrologic models at different resolution, despite using the same CMs, to using different reference time series for downscaling the CMs and different evapotranspiration routines, aside from other differences in the models.
