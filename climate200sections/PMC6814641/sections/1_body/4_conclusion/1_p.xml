   <p id="Par59">The impact of socioeconomic changes can be of the same magnitude, or larger, than the impact of climate change. This provides an indication and a hope that nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea can be reduced, and a direction for policy makers when evaluating the efficiency of mitigation measures and policies.</p>

   <p id="Par60">The impact of climate change is significant even in 2050s, although we cannot exactly estimate the magnitude of the impact due to the unknown future realization of the climate. This impact needs to be included in policy recommendations for the BSDB.</p>
