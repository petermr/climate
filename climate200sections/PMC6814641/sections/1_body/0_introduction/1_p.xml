<p id="Par12">The Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) and the European Union’s (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) both require substantial additional reductions of nutrient loads to the marine environment. The Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) estimated that for good environmental status to be achieved, annual reductions of 15,000 tonnes of phosphorus and 118,000 tonnes of nitrogen would be required (HELCOM
