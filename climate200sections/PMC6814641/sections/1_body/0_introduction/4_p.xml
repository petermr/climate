<p id="Par15">Only a limited number of studies on nutrient loads have analysed climate impacts combined with comprehensive socioeconomic changes. Most impact studies in the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin (BSDB) evaluated effects of nutrient reduction measures or land use changes (Wulff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>; Thodsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>). Andersson and Arheimer (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) made a historical reconstruction of nutrient pathways during 100 years of societal changes in a Swedish river basin, while Eriksson Hägg et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>) combined climate projections to the 2100s with scenarios of changes in population and their diet in the BSDB. At a large scale, Seitzinger et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>) evaluated changes in nitrogen loads for three development scenarios (“business as usual” with increased fertilizer use and increased animal proteins in the human diet, “diet” with a lower use of fertilizers and a larger share of plant proteins in the human diet than “business as usual”, and “regional air pollution” with nitrogen depositions reduced due to emission controls and all other inputs the same as in “business as usual”) for North America and Europe, while van Puijenbroek et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>) quantified nutrient emissions from municipal point sources with a country-scale model for two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, O’Neill et al.
