<p id="Par34">Both current and future conditions were simulated using all four selected CMs. Seven E-HYPE v.3.1.4 model runs were executed with each CM: (1–2) current and 2050s periods with current land use and nutrient sources, (3–5) 2050s period with land use and nutrient sources representing SSP1, 2 and 5, and (6–7) current and 2050s periods with current land use and nutrient sources, but with model parameters prior to recalibration. The last set of model runs was used to test the robustness of the E-HYPE model simulations and the dependency of the results on certain model parameters relevant in nutrient processes.</p>
