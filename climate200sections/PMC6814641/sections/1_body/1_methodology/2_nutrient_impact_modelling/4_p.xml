<p id="Par30">The E-HYPE model was recalibrated using 89 sites at the full pan-European scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) because insufficient nutrient observations were available to capture the southern agricultural parts of the BSDB adequately. The calibration period was from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010 (10 years) with an initial warm-up period from 1979 to allow the model to achieve stable conditions. The remaining sites were used to validate the model using the same time period.
