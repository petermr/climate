<p id="Par27">Daily discharges and nutrient loads for current and future conditions were simulated with E-HYPE for the BSDB. HYPE is an integrated hydrological and nutrient transport model code developed by SMHI (Lindström et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). E-HYPE, a pan-European model built using the HYPE software, simulates rainfall, runoff, riverine processes, and nutrient processes in hydrologically delineated catchments with a median size of 215 km
 <sup>2</sup> for all of Europe. We used E-HYPE v.3.1.4 (Hundecha et al.
