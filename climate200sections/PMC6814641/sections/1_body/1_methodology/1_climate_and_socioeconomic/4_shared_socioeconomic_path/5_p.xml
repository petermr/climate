<p id="Par26">SSP1, 2, and 5 were implemented by quantifying changes in nutrient sources (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) based on a spatial interpretation of qualitative narratives (Engardt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Zandersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2019</xref>) and the numerical projections available at the IIASA SSP Database (IIASA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>). Point source loads reflect changes in the population size, efficiency of sewage treatment, and new investments in infrastructure. Land use and agricultural practices follow changes in population, urbanization, and food production. Note that the SSPs should not be interpreted as “the best case”, “the worst case”, or even as “the most likely case” scenarios as they only represent plausible future developments.
