 <p>The study was performed at the SMHI Hydrological Research unit, taking advantage of previous work and other projects running in parallel. Hence, input from more people other than the authors was essential for the basis of this study. We would especially like to acknowledge contributions from Johan Strömqvist, Johanna Tengdelius-Brunell, Thomas Bosshard, Wei Yang, Hanna Gustafsson, Lorna Little, and Kristina Isberg. The present work was a joint effort of the BONUS projects ‘Reducing nutrient loadings from agricultural soils to the Baltic Sea via groundwater and streams (SOILS2SEA)’ and ‘Mediating integrated actions for sustainable ecosystems services in a changing climate (MIRACLE)’ in a cooperation with ‘Wellbeing from the Baltic Sea—applications combining natural science and economics (BALTICAPP)’. The projects received funding from BONUS, the joint Baltic Sea research and development programme (Art 185), funded jointly from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration and from Innovation Fund Denmark, The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvådsverket), The Polish National Centre for Research and Development, The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), The Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), Latvian Ministry of Education and Science, Academy of Finland, Projektträger Jülich, and Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS).</p>
