<p>Kiwifruit (
 <italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic>), a subtropical fruit vine, has been commercially grown in the southern part of Korea since the early 1980s. Among the major kiwifruit diseases that are already endemic in Korea, kiwifruit bacterial blossom blight (KBB), caused by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>syringae</italic> (Pss), is known to be considerably influenced by weather conditions during the flowering period of kiwifruit (

In severe cases, the infected buds drop, leaving a flower stalk attached to the vine. Recurrent, consecutive epidemics in the same location can lead to sudden outbreaks of the disease under favorable weather conditions. Here in this study, we use the word of “epidemic” as the dynamics of disease, that is, the change in the severity of disease with time (
