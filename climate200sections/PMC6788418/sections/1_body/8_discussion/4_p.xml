<p>The Pss-KBB Risk Model has a rainfall function that generates a temperature-dependent daily risk score only on rainy days, translating the temperature and rainfall conditions for the 10-day period before full bloom into a KBB risk score (
 <xref rid="b20-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Koh, 2015</xref>). Indeed, the comparisons between the KBB risks and both mean temperature and rainfall frequencies during the 10-day periods before full bloom in the future periods revealed that the rainfall frequency explained much of the variation in KBB risks, while the effect of mean temperature was negligible (

 <italic>i.e</italic>., the difference in KBB risks for the cultivar Hayward in the 2040s and 2050s, when rainfall frequencies were predicted to be similar but differences in the severity of epidemics were large, and the decrease of KBB risks after the 2070s, probably caused by the mean temperature increases during the critical infection periods. Nevertheless, we admit that it is difficult to determine the exact causes of annual variations in KBB risk level based on the mean values for each climate variable, as their accumulated and combined contributions in a daily scale resulted in such KBB risks (
