<p>As the flowering dates change, the corresponding temperature and rainfall conditions for the 10-day periods before full bloom, to which the KBB pathogen will be exposed, were assumed to change accordingly. In a study by

 <xref rid="b36-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Pennycook and Triggs (1991)</xref> showed that rainfall immediately before and during the flowering period was of paramount importance and determined the differences in severity of KBB between seasons. Since rainfall during flowering predisposes kiwifruit to diseases, installation of rainproof covers may contribute to reduced disease severity in kiwifruit orchards. Similar to rainfall, temperature affects population dynamics of the bacterial pathogen of KBB and its infection processes. The Plant and Food Research Institute in New Zealand reported in its bulletin a prediction model for KBB severity based on temperature data covering the 10 days before one percent of kiwifruit vines have flowered, indicating that the temperature before and during flowering affect disease development (
