<p>Based on the temporal changes in severe epidemics of KBB in Jeonnam province, we can predict that KBB will be more serious in the future, due to a complicated interaction between biological responses and climatic factors. This indicates that continuous studies are required to prevent occurrence of the KBB disease in Jeonnam province. Impact assessment in each district in the province will also aid in the development of localized adaptation strategies for local government units. An early warning system using the Pss-KBB Risk Model and short-term (2–3 days) to mid-term (7–15 days) weather forecasts will be useful for kiwifruit growers in Korea for the implementation of timely preventative disease control, as recently demonstrated for the kiwifruit bacterial canker disease (

These include replacing kiwifruit cultivars in local orchards with cultivars with higher disease tolerance or different maturity periods to avoid a high disease pressure season in the future (
