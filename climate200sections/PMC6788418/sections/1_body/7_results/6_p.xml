<p>Here we suggest a possible strategy to adapt to the identified impacts of climate change, in this case the KBB risk, using an alternative kiwifruit cultivar with an early maturity period: the gold-flesh kiwifruit cultivar Haegeum. By examining the early-maturing cultivar Haegeum (approximately 2 weeks earlier than the cultivar Hayward), we hoped to show that this cultivar avoids the high KBB pressures predicted during the flowering period of Hayward. Simulation using the Chill-day Model for the cultivar Haegeum showed that the flowering dates of Haegeum were indeed 12–14 days earlier than those of Hayward, with a similar advancing trend over the future periods (‘Flowering date-Haegeum’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Haegeum was also predicted to carry significantly lower KBB risks than Hayward in most of the future periods (‘Severe epidemics-Haegeum’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that the climatic conditions during the predicted flowering periods of Haegeum were less favorable to KBB development. The decadal KBB risks for Haegeum were of fewer than 1.5 days of severe epidemics over the future periods, and were significantly lower than Hayward, especially in the 2050–2070s, when Hayward carried the highest KBB pressures. Statistical analyses for the KBB risks and the decadal trends of mean temperature and rainfall frequency for Haegeum showed similar results to those of Hayward (‘Mean temperature-Haegeum’ and ‘Rainfall frequency-Haegeum’, respectively, in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), with rainfall frequency showing a high CC. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the cultivar Haegeum can be an alternative solution to coping with future KBB risks, replacing the cultivar Hayward, which is currently planted in kiwifruit orchards in Jeonnam province.
