<p>To simulate disease severity (%) using the existing Pss-KBB Risk Model, we developed an additional algorithm in the model: a regression equation between the simulated risk scores and the corresponding observed severity data. The resulting regression equation was Y = 0.102X + 0.0552 (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.976), where Y is the observed severity and X is the simulated risk score. The regression equation was validated by comparing the simulated disease severities with ground-truth data collected in major kiwifruit growing areas in the province (

The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root-mean-square error in the assessment of the similarity between the observed and the simulated severities were 2.68% and 3.12%, respectively, indicating a reasonably high performance of the equation in predicting disease severity according to the model (
