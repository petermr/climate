<p>Similar to the spatial representations of the KBB risks, mean decadal changes of the severe epidemics of KBB showed that KBB risks throughout Jeonnam province continued to increase and peaked in the 2060s, and then decreased in the 2080s (‘Severe epidemics-Hayward’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). On the other hand, the simulation of flowering dates by the Chill-day Model showed a decreasing (advancing) trend in the future periods (‘Flowering date-Hayward’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), showing a reasonable shift of the flowering date responding to the projected warming temperature. As the flowering dates change, the corresponding temperature and rainfall patterns for the 10-day period before full bloom, which are the primary cause for the fluctuating pattern of KBB risks over future periods, should change accordingly. To investigate this relationship, we displayed the decadal change of KBB risks together with decadal changes in mean temperatures and rainfall frequencies during the 10-day periods that the Pss-KBB Risk Model used to simulate disease risk. The mean temperatures over the future periods showed a slightly increasing trend over the range of 18.7–20.2°C (‘Mean temperature-Hayward’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). On the contrary, the rainfall frequency varied from 1.5 to 3.1 days over the future periods (‘Rainfall frequency-Hayward’ in 
 <xref rid="f6-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Statistical analyses indicated that the rainfall frequencies during the 10-day periods explained much of the variation in KBB risks, with a CC of 0.76 between the decadal changes of KBB risks and rainfall frequencies, while the CC with mean temperatures was negligible. Nevertheless, it was inferred that the decrease of KBB risks after the 2070s is caused by the mean temperature increases in the corresponding periods.
