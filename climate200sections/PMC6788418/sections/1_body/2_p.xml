<p>The Pss-KBB Risk Model predicts potential infection risk of the KBB, based on which kiwifruit growers can utilize the best practices related to spraying chemicals at the most effective time. In order to run the Pss-KBB Risk Model, the flowering period of kiwifruit should first be defined as the model utilizes weather information for 10 days preceding full bloom (
 <xref rid="b20-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Koh, 2015</xref>). A kiwifruit phenology model, called the Chill-day Model, predicts the flowering period using daily temperature information. The original Chill-day Model was introduced by

 <xref rid="b14-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al. (2005)</xref> to predict the flowering of fruit trees in the temperate zone. The modified Chill-day Model was applied and parameterized by

 <xref rid="b21-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2015b)</xref> to estimate the flowering date for the green flesh kiwifruit cultivar Hayward in Korea. This modified Chill-day Model for Hayward was adopted in our study to predict the flowering period, during which kiwifruit is known to be vulnerable to KBB infection.
