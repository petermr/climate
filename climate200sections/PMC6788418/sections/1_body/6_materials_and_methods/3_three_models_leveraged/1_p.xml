<p>In our recent study, the suitability areas for kiwifruit growth in Jeonnam province were determined using a climate suitability model, where five selected bioclimatic conditions were used as important determinants for the optimal growth of kiwifruit: (1) minimum threshold temperature for kiwifruit growth as a mandatory condition, and (2) freezing damage-tolerant temperature, (3) minimum length of the frost-free season, (4) winter chill requirement for flowering, and (5) water requirement for optimum growth as optional bioclimatic conditions. To calculate the five bioclimatic conditions, daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation data are used. Details on the conditions of each bioclimatic variable, the suitability algorithm, and its validity can be found in
