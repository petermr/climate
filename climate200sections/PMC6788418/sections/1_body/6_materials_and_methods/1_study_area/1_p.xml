<p>Jeonnam province is located in the southwestern part of the Korean Peninsula (
 <xref rid="f1-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It is generally characterized by a maritime climate because of the large proportion of coastal areas; however, distinctive features of a continental climate exist in the mountainous inland areas. The average rainfall for the period covering 1984–2013 was 1,471 mm, with a large inter-annual variation between 800 mm and 2,300 mm. Fifty-four percent of the annual rainfall falls during the summer monsoon season (June to August). The average temperature for the period covering 1980–2013 was 13.4°C, with an average minimum temperature of 8.7°C and an average maximum temperature of 18.9°C. Over the past 30 years, rainfall has decreased at a rate of 2.8 mm/y, while temperature has increased at the rate of 0.33°C/y (

 <xref rid="f1-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. However, cultivation has slowly extended toward the mountainous inland areas because of improved farming technologies and management skills, and the increasing temperatures that result from climate change. As of 2011, there are about 1,200 kiwifruit growers in Jeonnam province, producing more than 8,000 tons of kiwifruit annually from about 520 ha of orchards (statistics obtained from the Jeonnam Provincial Government).
