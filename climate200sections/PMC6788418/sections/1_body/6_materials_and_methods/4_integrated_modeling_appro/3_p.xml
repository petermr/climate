<p>As an example of possible adaptation strategies to the identified impacts of climate change, in this case the KBB risk, we simulated future KBB risks using another kiwifruit cultivar with earlier maturity than Hayward. Recently, we parameterized and validated the Chill-day Model to predict the flowering dates for a gold-flesh kiwifruit cultivar, Haegeum (
 <xref rid="b19-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Haegeum was bred by the Jeonnam Agricultural Research Institute and is currently cultivated on more than 120 ha in Jeonnam province. We replaced the Chill-day Model for Hayward with one for Haegeum and re-ran the models to generate decadal changes of the KBB risks on the cultivar Haegeum throughout Jeonnam province. The results were then compared with those obtained for Hayward.
