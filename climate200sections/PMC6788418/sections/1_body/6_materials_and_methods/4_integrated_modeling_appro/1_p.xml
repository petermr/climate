<p>Daily maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation data were extracted from the KMA scenarios for a series of modeling with three models. Three models were not physically linked or coupled to each other but were simulated in a logical order to generate base information for subsequent simulations by another model (
 <xref rid="f2-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). First, the Climate Suitability Model simulated suitable areas for kiwifruit cultivation in the historic and future periods, which were subjected to further model simulations with the kiwifruit Chill-day Model. The Chill-day Model simulated flowering dates of kiwifruit vines for individual grid locations in the historic and future periods, which then became the simulation periods by the Pss-KBB Risk Model to simulate the potential epidemic risks of KBB (hereafter referred to as KBB risk) in Jeonnam province.
