<p>Jeonnam province is located in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula and is a major kiwifruit growing area; as of 2015, almost 44% of kiwifruit cultivation in Korea took place in this province. Owing to warming temperature on the Korean Peninsula and improved management technologies, together with the local governmentâ€™s policy support over the last decades, the area of kiwifruit cultivation in Jeonnam province has expanded rapidly. However, the predicted effects of climate change on the kiwifruit industry in the province need to be addressed in order for the local government to institute realistic and effective adaptation strategies and policies. In particular, changes in environmental factors owing to climate change will affect plantmicrobe interactions, which influence disease epidemics at different magnitudes for a broad range of local communities (

Short-term countermeasures may include the establishment of a disease early warning system, and of a support system for making decisions about control sprays, to ensure the timely application of agro-chemicals and other cultural practices in high-risk areas, while long-term solutions targeting the next decades may include a breeding program for disease-tolerant or early/late-maturing cultivars equipped to resist or avoid high disease pressures.
