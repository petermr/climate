 <caption> Simulated severity of KBB compared to observed severity in 2015. (A) Simulated R scores (Sim. R scores) by the Pss-KBB Risk Model were converted into disease severity (Sim. severity), and then compared with the observed disease severities (Obs. severity). Weather information was collected from the weather stations near each investigated orchard. (B) Mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were calculated for both simulated disease severity and observed disease severity. Pss, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; KBB, kiwifruit bacterial blossom blight. </caption>
