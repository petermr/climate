<p>Swaziland faces a major decline in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a result of climate change impacts. This is because the main economic growth and development contributing sectors such as agriculture and water resources are also climate sensitive (SSA 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The Swaziland Sugar Association (SSA) maintains that the sugar industry provides 59% of agricultural output, 35% of agricultural wage employment and about 8% to the country’s GDP output (SSA 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The projected climate change impacts resulting in reduced water availability, health stress on the labour force and natural resources degradation will, therefore, affect the sector’s contribution towards GDP (Deressa, Hassan &amp; Poonyth 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). The major issue, therefore, is whether Small-Scale Farmers Associations (SSFAs) in the Lowveld sugar industry have the required adaptive capacity to climate change.
