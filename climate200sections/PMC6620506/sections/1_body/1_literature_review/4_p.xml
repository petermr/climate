<p>The documented environmental, economic and social impacts of climate change (Schulze &amp; Dlamini 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) indicate some negative consequences for the agriculture sector in Swaziland. Predicted climate change impacts include a reduction of rainfall, increased evaporation rates, decreased run-off and aggravation of droughts, salinisation, wind and dust storms (because of landscape degradation and land clearing) and increased frequency of extreme climatic events (SASA 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). On studying three catchments in Swaziland, namely, Komati, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma (Matondo, Peter &amp; Msibi 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), the authors concluded that stream flow in these catchments will be reduced under changing climate conditions. The expected decreases in stream flow because of climate change will necessitate the implementation of policies and strategies that will promote practices for conserving water resources (Matondo, Peter &amp; Msibi 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). A study on the Mbuluzi catchment, which feeds the Mnjoli Dam (a reservoir used primarily for storing irrigation water for sugarcane within the Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation [RSSC]), concluded that with a 2Â°C increase in temperature, coupled with a 10% reduction in precipitation, inflows to the reservoir will reduce by about 34% in median years (Schulze &amp; Dlamini 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). This condition indicates the level of vulnerability the sugarcane industry will face as a result of climate change impacting on the availability of water resources and at the right time for irrigation purposes.
