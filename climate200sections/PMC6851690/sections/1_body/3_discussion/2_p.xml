<p>This study has demonstrated that, although weather fluctuations tend to synchronize short‐term (i.e. annual) dynamics, the longer term dynamics of wild reindeer populations can be decoupled by spatially heterogeneous climate change effects. Annual fluctuations in the amount of ROS during winter contributed to synchronized mortality rates and, thereby, population dynamics across large distances in Svalbard (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), while paradoxically, the very same environmental driver contributed to opposite trends in local reindeer abundances (Figures 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g and 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). We document how such diverging population trends can occur due to local variation in both the relative strength of winter versus summer climate change trends (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and the density‐dependent responses to warming (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, the net outcome of improved carrying capacity versus worsening winter‐feeding conditions appears to be a growing total population of Svalbard reindeer (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d,g), in contrast to the recent patterns of decline observed in some other 
 <italic>Rangifer</italic> populations (Mallory &amp; Boyce,
