<p>Climate projections suggest that the rapid regime shifts observed in winter (Peeters et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and summer climate in Svalbard represent a bellwether for future changes in other parts of the Arctic (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Based on our results (see also Albon et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), it seems likely that continued warming leads to a changing relative importance of seasons for reindeer population dynamics, locally and at the meta‐population level. ROS events and the phenomenon of ice‐locked pastures are anticipated to increase further in frequency, magnitude and spatial extent, and not only in Svalbard (Bintanja &amp; Andry, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Rennert, Roe, Putkonen, &amp; Bitz, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Because the local impact of such events may depend on the population state, often with a multiplicative effect at high density due to the strong resource competition, a change in event frequency will influence population stability and local extinction probability in

 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Given the local variation in density–climate interactions found here, altered patterns of large‐scale population dynamics and synchrony can therefore also be expected.
