<p>During 1997–2015, data from weather stations across Svalbard showed an overall positive trend in both ROS (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,f) and summer temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). This indicates worsening winter feeding conditions due to more frequent icing (shown through in situ ice measurements, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>a), yet, at the same time, improved food abundance and carrying capacity due to higher plant productivity in the warmer summers (inferred by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>b). Although reindeer population size trajectories (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d) showed locally contrasting linear trends, varying from negative to positive (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g), there was evidence of a statistically significant increase over time of the ‘across Svalbard‐scale' reindeer abundance index (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g), weighted for local mean population sizes. Fecundity, mortality and population growth rates were all characterized by large annual fluctuations (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b,c,e), resulting in saw‐shaped patterns indicating direct density dependence. For instance, population growth rates 
 <italic>R
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> were particularly small in 2005, 2007 and 2009—i.e. years with fairly high levels of ROS at most weather stations, as well as high estimated mortality and low fecundity. Conversely, population growth rates were relatively large in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Thus, at the Svalbard scale, correlations with annual ROS
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> were negative for fecundity (Pearson's 
 <italic>r</italic> = −.63, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), positive for mortality (
 <italic>r</italic> = .56, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and negative for population growth rates (
 <italic>r</italic> = −.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .07) (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Linear regression models accounting for potential density dependence in this ROS effect confirmed the overall presence of direct density dependence but also indicated inconsistent patterns of climate–density interactions across populations (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).
