<p>As expected from the slightly different effects of local weather on population growth and the local differences in climate trends, we found contrasting abundance trends between the two populations. More specifically, the population size trend was strongly positive in Adventdalen (irrespective of trend starting year; Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d) where the local weather station data indicated no significant increase in ROS (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) but a strong regime shift in summer temperatures from the late 1990s (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In contrast, the trend slopes for the post‐irruptive Brøggerhalvøya population—which experienced weaker summer warming but stronger ROS increase—tended to be negative when the trend starting year was before ~2001 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). Since around that time, the population size first declined for then to stabilize around relatively low densities (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Accordingly, there was a consistent difference in estimated trends of abundance between the two focal populations (i.e. generally no overlap between confidence intervals and the mean estimate for the other population), irrespective of choice of trend starting year (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e).
