<p>To obtain a more detailed understanding of local population dynamics and trends, and the causes and consequences of spatial heterogeneity, we analysed the population dynamics of the two longer reindeer abundance time series from Adventdalen (1979–2015) and Brøggerhalvøya (1978–2015). These two populations are each near a manned weather station (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), enabling the inclusion of local weather conditions in the analyses. We first looked for linear trends and sudden break points in the mean (i.e. ‘regime shifts’) weather conditions, by implementing the
