<p>Reindeer population monitoring data were obtained using multiple census methods across 10 reindeer populations. Total counts of live reindeer, calves and carcasses (easily visible as patches of white fur in the terrain) were carried out annually by helicopter in early August 1997–2015 across six populations (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Five of these six populations are hunted in the fall with a fairly constant annual offtake corresponding to &lt;5% of the local population size. In addition, total population counts were performed annually on foot in late June/early July 1979–2015 in Adventdalen (Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Tyler, Forchhammer, &amp; Øritsland, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) and included the number of calves and carcasses. Finally, following the reintroduction of 12 reindeer to Ny‐Ålesund, Brøggerhalvøya, in 1978 and the subsequent population irruption and spatial expansion southwards (Aanes, Sæther, &amp; Øritsland, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>), three semi‐isolated populations in this northwestern area have been monitored by annual total ground counts (including number of calves). Counts were conducted by snowmobile in early spring (i.e. late March to April 1978–2015 on Brøggerhalvøya) and on foot in summer (i.e. July; Brøggerhalvøya 1999–2015; Sarsøyra 2000–2015, except 2011; Kaffiøyra 2002–2015, except 2011–2012) (Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Le Moullec et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The two seasonal measures of population size on Brøggerhalvøya were highly correlated (

 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). For Brøggerhalvøya, we used (a) the summer count time series in the analysis of Svalbard‐scale population dynamics and patterns of population synchrony (see below), to maximize methodological consistency; and (b) the spring count time series for the comparison of population dynamics with Adventdalen, to maximize time‐series length.
