<p>We analysed spatial synchrony in fecundity, mortality and population growth rates

 </italic> between the 10 local populations by implementing a nonparametric covariance function, which uses smoothing splines to estimate spatial covariance as a function of distance (Bjørnstad &amp; Falck, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). This method estimates spatial synchrony based on pairwise correlations and distances among populations. We set the maximum degrees of freedom for the smoothing spline to 4 (2 for mortality due to low sample size), and confidence intervals around the nonparametric curve were based on bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations. We used ≥5 years of data overlap as a criterion to calculate pairwise correlations, and the available population time series resulted in 45 (8–324 km), 15 (8–64 km) and 45 (8–324 km) pairwise correlations for reindeer fecundity, mortality (data lacking for Brøggerhalvøya, Sarsøyra, Kaffiøyra and Svenskøya; Table
