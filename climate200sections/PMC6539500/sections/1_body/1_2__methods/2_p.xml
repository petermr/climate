<p>The original scoping review captured literature from peer-reviewed and grey sources. As research on climate change and mental health is relatively nascent, both peer-reviewed and grey literature were needed to understand the breadth and depth of climate change risks and impacts on mental health. Inclusion criteria for the original scoping review study included all English peer reviewed and grey literature published globally between 2000 and 2017 relating to climate change and mental health. Publications were included if they addressed: how a changing climate affects mental health (e.g., risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities) and/or how climate-related impacts to mental health are managed (e.g., responses and response capacity). Articles were excluded if they only included a passing mention that climate change impacts mental health or a passing mention about responding to the mental health consequences of climate change.</p>
