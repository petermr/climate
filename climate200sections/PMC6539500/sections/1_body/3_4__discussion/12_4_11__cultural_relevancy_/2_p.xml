<p>In Canada, there are concerns about the lack of cultural empathy when dealing with Indigenous health writ large, and more specifically in acknowledging the role for Indigenous Knowledge on the topic of climate change and health [

Indigenous peoples are “often viewed as powerless victims of climate change, overlooking how social, cultural, and economic conditions determine how climate change is experienced, understood, and responded to, and downplaying the accumulated knowledge and wisdom embodied in traditional knowledge systems that can provide valuable lessons for adaptation” [

Failing to recognize the valuable role that Indigenous Knowledge plays is a key barrier to adaptation and resilience to climate change, especially considering that Indigenous peoples are amongst the most at risk, particularly to the mental health impacts [

Further, cultural empathy goes beyond recognizing the valuable role of Indigenous Knowledge but also means a depth of understanding about the heterogeneity amongst Indigenous groups and thus a heterogeneity of how psychosocial adaptation is most effectively employed and by whom [
