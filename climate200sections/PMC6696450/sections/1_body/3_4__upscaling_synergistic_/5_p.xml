<p>The reproduction capacity of marine organisms can also be impaired by the synergistic effects of pollutants and increased water temperature, as recorded for the mussel 
 <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This mussel species has often been used as a model organism for testing the effect of pollutants and climate change on marine benthic species [
 <xref rid="B89-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. For instance, Nardi et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and Nardi et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] recorded synergistic effects of multiple stressors, such as ocean acidification, increased temperature and metal pollution, in physiological processes associated with bioaccumulation, detoxification and other biological processes. The type of effects and their magnitude can also vary among life stages. Humanes et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] showed that the effect of warming and eutrophication affect fertilization of the tropical coral 
 <italic>Acropora tenuis</italic> in an additive manner, whereas the effect on embryos deformities was synergistic.
