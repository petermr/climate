<p>Multiple elements have been recorded for individual-based and community-based experiments, and the data generated in such experiments have often been used for building predictive ecosystem models that take into account the multitude and complexity of species interactions [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], can show strong geographic signals that are driven by local adaptation mechanisms driving thermal and pollution tolerance [
 <xref rid="B97-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This highlights that predicting the impact of different pollution drivers in a climate changing coastal environment can be extremely challenging due to the unique responses of different species, but also different populations locally adapted to a particular environment.
