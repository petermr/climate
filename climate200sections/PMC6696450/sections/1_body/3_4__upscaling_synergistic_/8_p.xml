<p>The synergistic effects of climate change and pollution in coastal environments is likely driven by a multitude of stressors acting at the individual and community level [

For instance, and as previously mentioned, the toxicity of numerous pollutants is expected to be higher under increased temperature, and the concentration of pollutants driven by agricultural runoff is expected to increase with decreasing rainfall. In contrast, increasing rainfall and flooding driven by climate change might also deliver more pollutants from agricultural fields, plantations, and impervious surfaces, such as urban environments, parking lots, pavements, and roads, to the aquatic and coastal-marine environment [

 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, the mechanistic drivers of such physico-chemical stressors at the organismal level are yet poorly understood.
