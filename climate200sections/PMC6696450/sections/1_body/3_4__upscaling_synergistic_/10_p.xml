<p>Statistical models used in ecosystem-level approaches allow research to address multiple stressors simultaneously. For instance, Ellis et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] showed that sedimentation, eutrophication, and metal pollution synergistically drive biodiversity loss and affect ecosystem stability and functioning. One key result is that the synergistic effect of these stressors is greater on species diversity than on ecosystem traits. This study additionally highlights the importance of multiple-stressor studies, as single stressor studies overlook the interactive effect of different drivers, regardless of being antagonistic or synergistic. Another study has demonstrated the synergistic effect of eutrophication and climate change on estuarine and coastal waters, and has identified enhanced vertical stratification and periods of increased flushing time as the mechanistic drivers for an increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms [
