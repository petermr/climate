<p>Besides temperature, ocean acidification has also been a driver tested in multiple-stressors studies. For instance, the immune response of the oyster 
 <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> was affected by a synergistic effect of ocean acidification and cadmium pollution [
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Additional results for this same species and stressors showed that ocean acidification notably aggravated the toxicity of cadmium, particularly ROS production and DNA damage of hemocytes, and also caused histopathological damage and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. These results are in agreement with the findings of Su et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] regarding the effect of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ocean acidification on the clam 
 <italic>Tefillarca granosa</italic>, and also with the information reviewed by Ivanina and Sokolova [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This latter study supports the synergistic impact of ocean acidification and metals on fitness-related functions of marine organisms. However, the synergistic effects observed in the latter studies do not represent a standard response of marine organisms to ocean acidification and metal pollution. For instance, Dorey et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] observed no additive or synergistic effects of acidification and copper on mortality of the sea urchin 
 <italic>Heliocidaris crassipina</italic>.
