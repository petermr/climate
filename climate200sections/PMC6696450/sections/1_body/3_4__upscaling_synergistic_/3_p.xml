<p>Temperature is one of the most common stressors assessed in studies using a multiple stressor approach. One the one hand, this has been driven by the identification of global warming as an emerging threat to natural ecosystems, but also by the importance of temperature as a driver of organismal metabolic rate. Temperature increase leads to a concomitant increase of metabolic rate. As a consequence, food consumption rate also increases in order to meet the higher energetic demand. This opens a direct gateway for pollutants in food items to enter into and bioaccumulate in biological systems and promote synergistic harmful effects of temperature and other stressors [
