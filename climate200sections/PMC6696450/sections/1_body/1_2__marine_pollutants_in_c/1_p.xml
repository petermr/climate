<p>Marine pollutants comprise a wide diversity of physical, chemical, and biological agents that induce negative effects on ecological systems whenever their magnitude is above a certain threshold. There are many thousands of these agents that have been added or created by human processes, and for most of which, the available knowledge is very scarce, especially on their environmental and ecosystem impacts [

Pollutants, regardless of being physical, chemical, or biological, may be ocean-born or may reach marine ecosystems through rivers drainage, point sources, and atmosphere transfers. Despite the multiple origin of pollutants, river basinsâ€™ drainage and direct point sources are often the main pathways of land-based sources, which represent approximately 80% of marine pollution globally [
