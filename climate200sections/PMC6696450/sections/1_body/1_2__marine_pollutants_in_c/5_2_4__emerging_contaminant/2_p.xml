<p>Microplastics are also emerging contaminants for which a large number of studies have been recently published [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The physical impact of microplastics in marine environments and organisms have been documented, while their ability to contribute to chemical pollution have been less stressed [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Indeed, microplastics may sorb and accumulate pollutants due to their chemical properties, small size and large surface to volume ratio, and they generally have a large potential for dispersal even for areas with no major pollution loads [
