<p>Some metals are essential for biological processes while others are not metabolized, but in both cases they tend to be of high toxicity even in small concentrations [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Toxic effects of metal exposure encompasses an increased energy demand, which affects marine organismsâ€™ metabolism and growth [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The toxicity of metals might also act as potent immunosupressors [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or lead to impaired development and reproduction [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Their negative effects on biota are quite diverse and depend on metal concentration, its speciation, interactions at receptors sites, uptake into the organism, detoxification ability, among others [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As they are not degradable, they tend to accumulate in organisms throughout food webs and are especially critical for top predators [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A typical example is mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnification in marine food webs [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], given that mercury exposure has been shown to cause severe neurotoxic effects in marine fauna and humans [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Despite the reducing anthropogenic emissions observed in the last decades [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], mercury pollution is acknowledged as an issue worldwide due to its long-distance transport and persistence in the environment.
