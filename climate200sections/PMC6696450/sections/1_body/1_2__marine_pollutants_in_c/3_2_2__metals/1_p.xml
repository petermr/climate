<p>Metals comprise a large number of elements and derivate substances that occur in nature, usually in very small concentrations. This group is poorly defined, since it often integrates other trace elements that are non-metallic, as is the case of arsenic or selenium [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Human activities have increased drastically metals’ concentrations in the environment, and in coastal zones in particular, with industrial and mining activities being the main anthropogenic sources of metals [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Estuaries are often repositories or sinks of historical metal contamination associated with metals’ strong particle reactivity with sediments [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Disentangling the anthropogenic input from the natural background is a considerable challenge, particularly considering the multiple factors influencing particle formation and adsorption or desorption of metals in coastal environments, and hence their bioavailability.
