<p>Considering the huge diversity of contaminants, climate variables, and their combinations it is extremely challenging to have a complete overview of their interactions and combined effects (

 <xref rid="B116-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] stressed that the joint efforts of researchers working at different levels of biological organization are needed to understand and predict global change effects on various functional types of organisms and scale up from physiological responses to large-scale integrated ecosystem responses in future climates. All contributions, from individual- to ecosystem-based, and from laboratory to field studies have increased our knowledge and are often important to set the next generation of research priorities and set study designs. Coastal areas are probably the most important areas in the study of contaminants and climate change interactions, since it is in these environments that human pressures are more intense. However, comparisons with other marine ecosystems could also be of extreme value where some of these pressures could be isolated, or at least studied in a more restricted combination. Multi-site, multi-taxa, etc., studies have also an extremely high ecological relevance, as they enable comparisons between different habitats, species, and life-cycle stages, among others.
