<p>A first rough estimate of these species-specific parameters can be made using only the maximum length of the species and the scaling laws predicted by the theory. Estimation of these parameters, including the parameter that quantifies the dependence of rates on temperature, can be improved using published, field or laboratory data, such as growth curves and reproduction rates. Using these procedures, DEB species-specific parameters have now been estimated and are freely available for more than 1000 species [

Temperature affects metabolism through the parameters that are time-dependent while toxics affect metabolism through the parameter that is linked to the mode of action of that particular toxic. Thus, a DEB model can easily combine the effects of climate change and pollution to estimate growth and reproduction rates under conditions that are different from the field or laboratory experiments. DEB allows modelling the effects of multiple stressors, such as temperature and pollutants, among others [
