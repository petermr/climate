<p>For the large majority of coastal zones, human pressures occur in a cumulative way, interacting with each other and generating effects that may be additive, antagonistic or synergistic [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite the increasing volume of literature addressing cumulative impacts, there is a huge gap in the knowledge on how different pressures may interact, what are their resulting effects, and what conservation and management decisions should be made to protect and restore marine coastal ecosystems. In this review, we evaluated the synergistic effects of two of the most important pressure in coastal zonesâ€”chemical pollution and climate change. We critically review the available literature and discuss the current knowledge, the main methodological approaches that have been used to evaluate them, and also identify the main research gaps.
