<p>Overall, coastal ecosystems may be particularly conspicuous to interactions between climate-change and chemical pollutants, due to the convergence of high levels of anthropogenic contamination resulting from present-day and historical discharges of multiple chemical compounds, with environmental changes predicted to be more pronounced and frequent in coastal areas than in the open ocean, such as hypoxia and decreased pH linked to increased freshwater runoff and nutrient discharge (e.g., [
