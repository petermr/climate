<p>Synergistic effects are likely to occur as multiple stressors impact coastal ecosystems (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] reported that multiplicative or synergistic effects were more common than additive interactions when assessing the responses of estuarine taxa to increased sedimentation, nutrients, and metal loadings associated with both increased urbanization and global changes in coastal environments.
