<p>Our study area of “New Guinea” spans a latitudinal range of −0.08° to −10.66°S and a longitudinal range of 129.42° to 150.21°E. It includes the main island of New Guinea and the smaller islands that were connected to mainland New Guinea during the last glacial maximum. We delimited it by selecting areas with a depth of ≥−120 m from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (
