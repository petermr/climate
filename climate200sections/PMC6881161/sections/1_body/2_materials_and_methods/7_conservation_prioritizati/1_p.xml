<p>We used the Zonation v. 4 software (
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>44</italic>
 </xref>) to produce a complementarity-based and balanced ranking of conservation priority over the entire landscape. Zonation iteratively removes the planning units that lead to smallest aggregate loss of conservation value, after accounting for total and remaining distribution of species, species weights, and species-specific connectivity. Because Zonation applies successive range-size normalization for all species (
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>44</italic>
 </xref>), and species with a small range receive higher priority, we did not assign higher weights to species with a small range size. To model conservation value in the context of climate change, we selected interaction as the connectivity method linking present distributions to future distributions (
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>45</italic>
 </xref>). As this method links present distributions to future distributions within a dispersal distance, areas with greater overlap of present and future ranges will emerge as priorities. These areas will tend to be in regions with more available niche space within dispersal distance—and therefore potentially attainable by the species as the climate changes. We set a 2000 to 2070 dispersal parameter of 100 km that resembles the 16.9–km decade
 <sup>−1</sup> median shift to higher latitudes exhibited by terrestrial taxa in response to changing climate (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>). For the cell-removal rule, we used the core area zonation (CAZ) rule, which bases ranking on the most important occurrence of a species in a cell (rarity), so that even species-poor cells may be identified as priorities. To avoid identifying as priorities those cells with low habitat intactness, we removed cells with a human footprint score greater than 6 [i.e., areas of higher human modification (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>46</italic>
 </xref>)]. Human footprint data at a 1-km resolution were downloaded from (
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>46</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>47</italic>
 </xref>) and aggregated to a 10-km resolution. We omitted protected areas from solutions, since these areas are already protected. Protected area polygons were downloaded from the World Database on Protected Areas dataset of the Protected Planet website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://protectedplanet.net" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://protectedplanet.net</ext-link>) (
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>48</italic>
 </xref>), and only “designated” areas that belong to International Union for Conservation of Nature protected area categories I to VI were selected.
