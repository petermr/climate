<p>Projecting SDMs to two future climate change scenarios (Fig. 2 B and C), we find that mean species richness is expected to decrease to 691 under 2070 RCP 8.5 (with similar results of 688 under RCP 2.6). About 63% of species will have smaller geographic ranges, and 37% will have larger ranges under 2070 RCP 8.5. On average, range reductions will be of −19 ± 15 cells per species (range, −1 to −106), and expansions will be of 19 ± 24 cells (range, 1 to 246). Upscaling to the level of ecoregions (

 </xref>), we find that climate change will result in less diverse ecoregions with an average of −70 ± 40 fewer species per ecoregion (range, −246 to 107 species) under 2070 RCP 8.5 (

Ecoregions with more pronounced reductions in species richness include the Admiralty Islands lowland rain forests, Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests, New Britain–New Ireland montane rain forests, and the Northern New Guinea montane rain forests (table S1). A high reduction in species richness in the lowlands is of special conservation concern because lowland ecoregions are among the least protected and at the same time the most threatened in New Guinea and will require the largest protected area sizes to keep pace with climate change (
