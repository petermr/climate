<p id="Par19">We found both for the PlaSim and for the CESM climate realizations that the ensemble mean of the zonal-seasonal mean stretching rate decreases for almost all of the latitudes with the increase of the global mean surface temperature. It implies that the proportion of the mean length of 10-day-old filaments of the later years (
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>later</sub>) and that of the former years (
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>former</sub>) decreases to 60%. In individual realizations, this change might be somewhat larger and the ratio might fall below 40%. Our results imply that the intensity of the spreading and, therefore, the typical extension of a polluted region from a pollution event decreases almost everywhere on the globe. We note that the decrease of the spreading might cause larger pollutant concentration for several regions, resulting in higher environmental risk. For completeness, we mention that in some regions, typically near the poles PlaSim shows an opposite trend, where

 <sub>later</sub>/

 <sub>former</sub> even exceeds to 270%.
