<p id="Par26">In this paper, the spreading of ideal tracers, corresponding to inert gases, are investigated. For such particles, the velocity of a particle coincides with the velocity of the air at the location of the particle at any time instant. We proved in ref.

 </sup> that the effect of turbulent diffusion is negligible on the stretching process for large-scale atmospheric dispersion events, therefore, we also neglect it in this study in the calculation of the transport of the pollutants. As the motion of ideal tracers is studied, if in the 3D simulations (PlaSim) in those exceptional cases when a particle encounters with the surface, it bounces back to the atmosphere by a perfectly elastic collision. RePLaT determines the particle trajectories using Euler’s method, where the time step is the same Δ
