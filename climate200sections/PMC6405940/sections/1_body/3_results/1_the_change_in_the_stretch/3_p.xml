 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c,d</xref>. The shape of the curves is similar for both climate models, which–as a side product–supports the applicability of PlaSim in this context. We note that the reason of the higher 〈
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>λ</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>〉 values for CESM is the consequence of the resolution of the utilized velocity fields: the more detail a field contains the more meandering and curly the filament can become, i.e., the results tend to show some dependence on the grid resolution. The 〈

 <sup>−1</sup> from 1990 to 2080 for both seasons and for almost the entire globe.
