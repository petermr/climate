<p id="Par17">The upper 6 panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrate that during the time-period of the stationary climate (violet) no trend can be seen either for the stretching rate (as stated earlier, based on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>) or for the absolute value of the relative vorticity of the 500 hPa level. During the time-period of the CO

 <italic>ξ</italic>|
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> decrease in parallel. The ensemble mean pairs of 〈

 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>〉 and 〈|
 <italic>ξ</italic>|
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>〉 reveal the relation much more clearly as they are located along straight lines with a decrease of 0.01–0.03 day
 <sup>−1</sup> and [0.1–0.15] × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Therefore, it makes sense to fit regression lines to the ensemble mean data. The slope of the fits and the correlation coefficients calculated for (〈

 <italic>ξ</italic>|

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and show a strong correlation between the stretching rate and relative vorticity with correlation coefficients beyond 0.93. Although the “outlier” panel of NM/DJF in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> with 〈|
 <italic>ξ</italic>|
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>〉 calculated from the relative vorticity of the 500 hPa level does not trace out a straight line and therefore its correlation coefficient is much lower than the others ones’, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that even for this case a very well-fitting linear relation between 〈
 <italic>h</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,

 <italic>ξ</italic>|
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
