<p id="Par18">In the case of the CESM climate realizations, even if we do not have continuous data for the time-period of 1990–2080, the lower 6 panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> strengthen our assumption that the stretching rate and the absolute value of the relative vorticity change in parallel in time. Similarly to most of the geographical regions in the PlaSim, 〈

 <sup>−5</sup> and 0.1 × 10

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. A slightly greater variability in the ensemble mean values of subsequent years can be seen in the lower 6 panels than in the upper 6 panels of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> which is due to the much fewer members of the ensemble for the CESM simulations. Based on the results of the PlaSim simulations assuming a linear relation between the stretching rate and the relative vorticity, the slopes of the linear fits to the ensemble mean data and the corresponding correlation coefficients are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The slopes are similar in values to those obtained from the PlaSim simulations with a mean of approximately [6–7] × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> day, and, furthermore, all of them are on the order of magnitude of the slope found for the relation of the stretching rate and the relative vorticity in Section
