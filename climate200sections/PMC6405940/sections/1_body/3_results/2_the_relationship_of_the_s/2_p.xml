<p id="Par16">We found that a particularly illuminating way of expressing this relationship is to plot the areal-seasonal mean

 </sub> vs. the areal-seasonal mean of the absolute value of the relative vorticity |

  <italic>a</italic>,

 </sub> for each of the PlaSim and CESM climate realizations, respectively. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> these data are plotted as empty circles. The ensemble mean values of these quantities (filled circles) for each year are also displayed in the panels. Circles are colored from blue to red according to the year they represent (see figure caption for the details). The globe is divided into three belts (SM/NM: mid- and high latitudes of Southern/Northern Hemisphere, and TR: tropical belt) for which we assume that their areal-seasonal mean |

 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> principally influences the stretching of the filaments initialized there. For the CESM simulations the three belts are symmetric and range as 90 °S–30 °S (SM), 30 °S–30 °N (TR) and 30 °N–90 °N (NM), respectively. For the PlaSim climate realizations, in order not to smooth out the values of the latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere with the definite increasing and the ones with decreasing trends, we choose the boundaries as 90 °S–25 °S (SM), 25 °S–40 °N (TR) and 40 °N–90 °N (NM), respectively.
