<p id="Par6">In the case of PlaSim an ensemble of 110 climate realizations is used. As the 360 ppm CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration is often used as a reference level in climate studies, representative of the present-day value, and its doubling is a widely used scenario

 </sup> each of the realizations is characterized by a 50-year-long plateau with constant CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration which is followed by a doubling of the CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration from 360 ppm to 720 ppm over 100 years (implying an increase of 6 °C in the ensemble mean of the global mean surface temperature). Because the transient time of the ensemble is found to be about 30 years in earlier studies
