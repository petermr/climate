<p id="Par2">In recent decades there is a growing interest in the potential consequences of climate change. Numerous studies

 </sup> reported that the cyclonic activity and the number of cyclones have changed in the last decades. At the same time the question arises whether quantities related to cyclones—such as the intensity of the spreading of atmospheric pollutant clouds—could also change during a climate change. It has been shown in ref.

 </sup> that, based on a single set of reanalysis data, a change can be identified from 1979 to 2015 in the areal mean of the intensity of the pollutant spreading, for both the tropics and the extratropics. It has been also reported in that study that a strong correlation is found between the intensity of the spreading and the relative vorticity in the time series of the two quantities.
