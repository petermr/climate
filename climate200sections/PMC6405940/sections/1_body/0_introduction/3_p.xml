<p id="Par4">In practice, this ensemble technique corresponds to studying an ensemble of parallel climate realizations in which the initial conditions of the individual field realizations slightly differ but the dynamics of all realizations are subjected to the same governing equations. Therefore, this approach is similar to ensemble weather forecasts

 </sup>, however, in contrast to them, the time-interval for the climate realizations is long enough for the ensemble members to forget their initial conditions. After a transient time the ensemble correctly characterizes the potential set of typical climate states permitted by the climate dynamics. An introduction to the concept of this ensemble approach can be found in refs
