 <caption> Scatter plots. Diagrams for the areal-seasonal mean stretching rate h a, s and its ensemble mean 〈 h a, s 〉 versus the areal-seasonal mean of the absolute value of the relative vorticity | ξ| a,s  of the level 500 hPa and its ensemble mean 〈| ξ| a, s 〉 for JJA and DJF and for SM, TR and NM for the PlaSim (upper 6 panels) and CESM (lower 6 panels) climate realizations. Years are colored as in Figs  2 and 3. Empty circles correspond to the individual ensemble members and filled circles with black edge correspond to the ensemble means. </caption>
