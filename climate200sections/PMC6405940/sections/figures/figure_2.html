 <caption> Time-dependence of the stretching rate in different climate realizations. The zonal-seasonal mean h λ, s of the stretching rate h and the ensemble mean 〈 h λ, s 〉 of h λ, s for the PlaSim climate realizations at 30 °N in JJA for years 30–49 (before climate change, in the shades of violet) and for years 50–150 (after the outset of the climate change, from blue to red). Colored circles represent the data of the whole ensemble, the ones connected with the dashed line correspond to the member E = 64 and the thick solid line indicates the ensemble mean 〈 h λ, s 〉 in Fig.  3a. </caption>
