 <caption> Left: Pollutant patterns. Advection image of 17 pieces of initially 6°-long filaments on the 10th day after the initialization using the meteorological data of the ensemble member E = 64 from the PlaSim realizations. Initial conditions: n 0 = 1000 particles initiated on December 1, yr 64 at 00 UTC at 30 °E, 500 hPa from 80 °S to 80 °N in 10° increments (see the thick colored line segments). Right: The length of the filaments in time (solid lines) and the exponential functions fitted from day 3 to 10 (dashed lines). The stretching rate of the filaments are indicated in the legend. </caption>
