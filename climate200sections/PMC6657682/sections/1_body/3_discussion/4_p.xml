<p>The relative contribution of habitat loss and climate change as extinction drivers of microendemics varies across domains. Habitat loss is the most critical factor in the Atlantic Forest, where most of the natural ecosystems were lost due to the replacement of natural ecosystems by agriculture fields and urban areas (

 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Torres &amp; Marengo, 2014</xref>). The risk caused by climate change is higher in areas with microendemics in the Amazon, in the high plateaus in the Cerrado and Caatinga, and in Pantanal. These areas show high climate change risk through different GHG forcing scenarios and Earth System Model datasets (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Torres &amp; Marengo, 2014</xref>) and are still relatively intact, although habitat loss is projected to increase in these areas until 2100. Habitat loss and climate change can drive the extinction of microendemics in areas of the southwestern Atlantic Forest, the southern Cerrado, and along the Amazonâ€™s deforestation arch. Most of these areas have recently been modified by human activities as a consequence of the ongoing expansion process of large-scale commercial agriculture (
