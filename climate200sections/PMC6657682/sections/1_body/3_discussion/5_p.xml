<p>Projecting the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species due to habitat loss and climate change has been limited to date because they are known only from a few localities, which makes the use of species distribution models unreliable. Although our analysis addressed some of these shortcomings by shifting the focus from species ranges to the areas where these species live, our projections have limitations similar to most studies using taxonomic and distribution datasets in tropical regions. The first limitation is the reliance on information on the taxonomy and distribution of species to identify areas with microendemics. However, by relying on the previous collective effort of botanists to identify and map rare species of seed plants in Brazil (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Giulietti et al., 2009</xref>) and counting on electronic journals and databases to update the original dataset, we have been able to overcome some of these challenges. Nevertheless, our analysis, such as any other evidence-based projection, should be updated and evaluated over time. A second limitation of our approach is that it does not lead to a deep understanding of the complex mechanisms by which habitat loss and climate change together or separately would increase the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species. Mechanistic studies are more reliable when they are conducted on small rather than large scales (

By pinpointing the areas with plant microendemics coupled with habitat loss and climate change estimates, we hope to help researchers who are interested in extinction risks and conservation make better site selections for experiments. Finally, the third limitation of our study is that it assessed two extinction drivers (habitat loss and climate change). Thus, the impacts of drivers such as invasive species, pollution, and overexploitation on narrowly distributed native plants continue to be unchecked (

Despite all the limitations above, the analytical approach used here is simple and, at the same time, robust and replicable enough to help conservationists and decision makers in tropical countries to detect essential areas for conservation and assess the extinction risks of narrowly distributed species.
