<p>Prospective conservation strategies are recommended for species endemic to areas that are threatened exclusively by climate change or by a combination of climate change and habitat loss. Hence, to protect species endemic to areas where the major threat is climate change, governments should establish conservation networks inside and beyond the areas with microendemics that facilitate the natural adaptation of the species and their habitats to the new climatic conditions. There are still space and time to design and implement new climate-resilient conservation networks to protect these species because such areas remain relatively intact. In contrast, for species endemic to areas that are simultaneously affected by habitat loss and climate change, governments should deploy more complex management solutions to facilitate their maintenance under new climate conditions in a landscape dominated mostly by human-made ecosystems. Such solutions should include a mix of protected areas, ecological restoration in critical sites and corridors, active manipulation of habitat conditions to better match species requirements, and
