<p>Most conservation policies in Brazil and other tropical countries do not include considerations of climate change (

 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Magness et al., 2011</xref>). Because climate change is irreversible, current policies should also be prospective. In other words, they should work proactively to facilitate the transition of the species and ecosystems to a new set of climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Magness et al., 2011</xref>). The decision on what strategy to use depends on the current state of habitat loss and climate change risk of the places where species live. In general, retrospective strategies are suitable for those species endemic to areas with low risk or that have habitat loss as a major threat. For species endemic to areas with low risk, conservation through protected areas is the most effective action. For species endemic to areas where habitat loss is the primary threat, the efforts should be focused on conserving the remaining natural vegetation as much as possible through establishing protected areas and restoring vegetation in critical places.
