<p>Habitat loss is the predominant factor increasing the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species of seed plants in Brazil. However, climate change (alone or interacting with habitat loss) can also increase the extinction risk of a substantial number of species. Despite the uncertainties on how climate is going to change ecosystems within areas with microendemics (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Torres &amp; Marengo, 2014</xref>), as well as how these microendemics will react to the effects of such changes, recent studies have all indicated that plant species with small ranges and narrow habitat preferences have a high likelihood to show range retraction and consequently go extinct (

 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We found that 5% of microendemics in this study live in areas that have lost most of their original vegetation cover and have a high climate change risk, but this percentage can increase to 16.2% by 2100 if no conservation action takes place. Low habitat coverage due to insufficient protection increases extinction risk because it reduces the adaptive capacity of species to cope with climate change (

 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Eigenbrod et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, this group of microendemics is the most threatened, and the areas where they live are top priorities for more studies and conservation intervention.
