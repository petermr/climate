<p>The number of areas and microendemics classified in each risk class varies according to the land-use scenario. In scenario 1, almost 70% (1,597 of the 2,354) of the microendemic species of seed plants in Brazil are under high extinction risk, 111 are in areas with both high climatic risk and high habitat loss, 926 are in areas with high habitat loss but low-to-medium climatic change risk, and 560 are in areas under high climatic risk and low-to-medium habitat loss (

In scenario 2, the number of threatened species increases to 1,942 (c. 82%), with 342 in areas with both high climatic risk and high habitat loss, 1,271 in areas with high habitat loss but low-to-medium climatic change risk, and 329 in areas under high climatic risk and low-to-medium habitat loss (

Finally, we found that 2,054 (c. 87%) microendemics are under high risk in scenario 3, with 381 in areas with both high climatic risk and high habitat loss, 1,383 in areas with high habitat loss but low-to-medium climatic change risk, and 290 in areas under high climatic risk and low-to-medium habitat loss (
