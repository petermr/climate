<p>Among the 2,354 microendemic species analyzed in this paper, only 338 (14.3%) have been included in the official Brazilian plant Red List (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, 2014</xref>). As expected, most of these species, ranging from 61.2% in scenario 1 to 86.9% in scenario 3, are also classified as having high extinction risk in our analyses (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If we count the number of microendemics that are not on the official Brazilian Red List but that are projected to have high extinction risk, we find the following numbers: scenario 1, 1,391 species; scenario 2, 1,665 species; and scenario 3, 2,017 species.
