<p>Global change scenarios project that habitat loss and climate change will be intensified until the end of the century and that, together, they have the potential to drive thousands of species to extinction (

In this paper, we evaluate the extinction risk of narrowly distributed species of seed plants in Brazil due to habitat loss and climate change. Brazil is a good case study to apply this analytical approach because the country shelters the world’s richest flora (
