<p>In Brazil, the RCCI ranges from 0 to 28 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>), so we used the min-max normalization linear scaling transformation technique to rescale it to scores ranging from 0 to 1, with values close to 1 representing the highest climatic risk when comparing areas with microendemics. The areas with microendemics were also classified into three equal size categories according to their normalized climate change index: low (≤0.33), medium (&gt;0.33 and &lt;0.66), and high (≥0.66).
