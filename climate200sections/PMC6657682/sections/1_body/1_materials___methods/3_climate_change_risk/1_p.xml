<p>To estimate the climate change risk for areas with microendemics, we used the Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI). The RCCI is a qualitative index that synthesizes a large number of climate model projections and identifies those regions where climate change could be more pronounced in a warmer climate by the end of the 21st century (

Therefore, the RCCI was not designed to predict specific changes in climate and vegetation that could take place in a given area because such changes are likely determined by a complex combination of physical, biological, and human characteristics (

Nevertheless, by providing an index by which the areas can be compared and ranked according to their likelihood of being affected by climate change, the RCCI is a useful tool for defining priority areas for studies of impact, adaptation, and vulnerability (
