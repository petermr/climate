<p>We intersected the localities of the restricted-range species with the fifth-order watersheds mapped at a scale of 1:250,000 by the Brazilian government (

 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Giulietti et al. (2009)</xref> to identify key biodiversity areas for rare plant species in Brazil. Watersheds with at least one species restricted to them were treated as areas with microendemics. We used these watersheds as operational geographic units because we are interested in identifying small (median size =189.3 km
 <sup>2</sup>) natural areas in Brazil with narrowly distributed species (microendemics) of seed plants. This strategy allows us to assess the extinction risk of species that are more vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change in distinct areas and that can be, from a legal viewpoint, used for conservation planning purposes (
