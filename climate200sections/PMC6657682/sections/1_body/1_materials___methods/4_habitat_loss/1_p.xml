<p>Habitat loss is defined here as every replacement of native vegetation by anthropogenic land-cover categories. We estimated the proportion of habitat loss in each area with microendemics by intersecting the map of these areas with Brazilâ€™s official land cover map for 2000 and 2014, produced by IBGE at a 1:250,000 scale (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">IBGE, 2017</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). In these maps, 14 land cover categories were identified: (1) artificial areas, (2) croplands, (3) pasturelands, (4) mosaics of cropland with forest, (5) silviculture, (6) forests, (7) mosaics of forest with cropland, (8) grasslands, (9) wetlands, (10) natural pasturelands, (11) mosaics of cropland with grassland, (12) continental lakes, (13) coastal lakes, and (14) natural exposed rock and soil. We considered as habitat loss all land-cover categories except forests, grasslands, natural pasturelands, wetlands, lakes, and natural exposed rock and soil.
