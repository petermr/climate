<p>We estimated the proportion of habitat loss in each area with microendemics between 2000 and 2014 and used the average annual rate of habitat loss between 2000 and 2014 of each area to project three land-use scenarios that represent immediate conservation action (scenario 1), long-term conservation action (scenario 2), and no conservation action (scenario 3). Scenario 1 assumes that natural vegetation remnants detected in 2014 are protected until the end of the century. Scenario 2 assumes that the current annual rates of habitat loss will not change until 2050, when all the remaining natural ecosystems will then be fully protected until 2100. Scenario 3 assumes that the current rates of habitat loss in each area with microendemics will continue until 2100 with no conservation action. In each scenario, we classified the areas with microendemics into three equal categories of habitat loss: low (≤0.33), medium (&gt;0.33 and &lt;0.66), and high (≥0.66).</p>
