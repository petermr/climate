<p>While there is a long tradition in the agricultural economics literature of using household surveys in econometric models that explain yields, since at least [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], there is much less literature using climate variables within this type of models. Hence, climate specification model selection is based in minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), that punishes more heavily parameter addition as compared to the also popular Akaike Information Criterion. A table with a selection of climate model specifications considered, and how they fared with different statistics with respect to the model presented here is included in
