<p>The agro-climatic heterogeneity of Peru implies that the increase in frequency of an event (for example precipitation) does not have the same impact in the different regions of Peru, i.e. rain in the arid coast or the tropical rainforests. We considered climate variables having differentiated impacts by eco-regions (coast, mountains, rainforests / selva) and by survey strata (i.e. North Coast, Center Coast, etc.), but chose the former based on the BIC. Furthermore, climate variables need to reflect 12 months of data, as the production information from the household survey is annual. Ideally, we would like these 12 months to reflect the agricultural year according to harvests, instead of the calendar year. Nevertheless, the agricultural calendar varies by agro-climatic zone. Distinct alternatives such as different cut-off months by administrative region, and eco-region were explored, but based on the goodness of fit a country-wide agricultural year ending on July was chosen.</p>
