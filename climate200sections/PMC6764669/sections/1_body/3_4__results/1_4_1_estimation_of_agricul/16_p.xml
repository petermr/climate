<p>There are several ways to gauge the contribution of the climate variables to this yields model. Here we focus in the contribution of the climate vector in explaining yield variability, and the marginal contribution of each climate attribute to yields by eco-region. The model explains 72% of yield variability, the R-squared. This statistic cannot be linearly decomposed, because the order in which variables are entered to the model affect its contribution, which is why researchers usually average the contribution of variables over all possible orderings, the Lindeman, Merenda and Gold or Shapley decomposition, see [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The first column of 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows in parenthesis the contribution (in percentage) of each variable group to the total R-squared. Not surprisingly, inputs (land, seeds, fertilizer, employment, etc.) is the most important set of variables, accounting for 70% of explained variability. Climate accounts for 10% of explained variability, and provides an equivalent contribution to all geographic, time and location fixed effects variables (31 variables in total). Another way to assess the contribution of the climate vector to the yields model is to look at the marginal contribution of each climate attribute to yields. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> show that climate vector is not only highly significant in explaining observed yields, but provides sensible results. The complete climate vector, as well as each climate indicator (high and average temperatures, precipitation, and seasonality) are all significant with

 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the marginal impact of each climate attribute on yields. It can be shown that the marginal impact of, say maximum temperature in the Coast, would be:

 </inline-formula>, where 
 <italic>T</italic> is 38, the years from 1970 to 2008 the year around which the data is centered. These marginal impacts by variable and eco-region are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In the case of the Coast region, where agriculture is almost exclusively irrigated (being extremely arid, off-river-valleys agriculture is practically non-existent), precipitation impacts yields marginally, but note that precipitation in the coast is negatively correlated with precipitation in the Mountains, which is ultimately relevant for irrigation and yields in the coast (see correlation matrix in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222483.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Higher temperatures are correlated with higher yields, given that the hotter Northern Coast is more productive, while higher mean temperatures are consistent with lower yields, likely due to heat stress. On the mountains, where there is both irrigated and rainfed agriculture, province-level atmospheric temperature is not significant, because temperature changes more drastically with altitude rather than climate. Rain is an important driver of yields, with yields responding positively to well-marked rainy seasons, while years with excessive rain and spread throughout the year negatively impacts yields.
