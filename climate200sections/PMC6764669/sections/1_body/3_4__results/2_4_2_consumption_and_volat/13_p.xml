<p>With respect to other relevant variables, the percentage of people in the household who do not work increase vulnerability. The number of adults in the household as well as the number of women diminish the caloric consumption per capita, but also diminishes the volatility of said consumption. Of the characteristics of the head of household, being a man, having a higher education level, reduce the vulnerability of the household, while the age shows an expected quadratic relationship, increases the consumption during youth, but reduces it during old age. Participation in the 
 <italic>Vaso de Leche</italic> (glass of milk) program does not increase caloric consumption, probably because these are the households already vulnerable, but it does accomplish diminishing the volatility of caloric consumption, diminishing vulnerability. On the other hand, participating in soup kitchens unequivocally diminishes the vulnerability of the household. Note however, that this model cannot be interpreted as an evaluation of public policies. Here the participation in programs is used only as a control variable. To adequately evaluate the programs one must deal with the self-selection bias of these programs, which is not done here.
