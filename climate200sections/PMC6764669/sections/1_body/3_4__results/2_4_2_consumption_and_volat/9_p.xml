<p>As described above, the model is estimated by maximum likelihood, which is equivalent to reiterating the recursive model of both, consumption and variance, in their log-linear form by GLS following the steps proposed by Just and Pope in their stochastic production model [

The principal determinants of consumption are agricultural and non-agricultural income, and additionally characteristics of the household and head of household are included. To control the effects of non-observable time invariant characteristics we use geographic characteristics and fixed effects at the department level, as well as time fixed effects to control for country-wide temporal shocks.
