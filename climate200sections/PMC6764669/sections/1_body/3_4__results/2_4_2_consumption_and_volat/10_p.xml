<p>It is expected that the caloric consumption is positively related to attributes that increase the access to food, like incomes and education, and negatively related to those that reduce it, like unemployment. With respect to the variance in caloric consumption, it is expected that it is positively related to attributes that increase the vulnerability of a household, like household economic dependency, household size, and also variables that increase caloric consumption, but are simultaneously sources of dispersion, like agricultural income which by its nature is more variable. In contrast, the variables that should be negatively related to variance of caloric consumption are those which diminish the vulnerability of the household, acting as support in situations of need, variables such as the assets of the household, the social capital (including marriage), and some public assistance policies.</p>
