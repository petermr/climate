<p>First, observe in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> that, being an agricultural income-earning household contributes to the increase in calories per capita consumed, and at the same time decreases their vulnerability. This finding allows one to understand that subsistence agriculture, from a nutritional perspective, plays a role beyond generation of income, contributing in a significant way to the food security of its members (it is also a likely signal of market failures, see below). But at the same time, the greater the percentage of household income coming from agriculture, the lower the caloric consumption; that is to say, those households highly dependent on agricultural activity are the most vulnerable. It is this group that faces the highest food security risks in the face of CC, given that their income depends to a greater extent on the success of agricultural activities. As expected, agricultural income as well as non-agricultural income increase caloric consumption, and at the same time, both increase the volatility of consumption (we find that the elasticity of consumption with respect to non-agricultural income is greater than agricultural income).
