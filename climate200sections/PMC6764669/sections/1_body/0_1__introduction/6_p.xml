<p>The study presented in this paper is a step forward in improving ground-level micro simulation of CC. First, instead of simulating temperature increases or declines in precipitation, it uses a new climate dataset, which provides climate projections towards 2050, in a higher resolution 10km grid for Peru. Obviously, this is a great improvement, because climate change is complex, and in a large and agroecologically diverse country like Peru, changes in temperatures and precipitation are expected to vary even in nearby areas. The micro-modeling presented in this work, also represents a step forward in the modeling of climate impacts on FS, following the work of [

 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we develop a three-stage model that includes climate risk, and deals with endogeneity of incomes and simultaneity of expected consumption and its variability.
