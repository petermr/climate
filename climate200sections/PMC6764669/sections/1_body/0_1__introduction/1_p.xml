<p>In face of the growing and overwhelming evidence of large changes in global weather patterns, science from different disciplines has been called to provide evidence of the impacts of these global changes. A particular focus of attention for both scientist and funding institutions has been agri-food systems that are believed to be most acutely impacted by these climate changes (see for example, [

 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The present document is part of this fast-growing multidisciplinary effort: it brings advances in weather data collection and modeling, and developments in socioeconomic climate microsimulations to discuss the implications of climate change in the design of public policies that combat food insecurity.
