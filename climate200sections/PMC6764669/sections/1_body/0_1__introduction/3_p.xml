<p>These type of models have been criticized in the literature because beyond crop and area selection, these models ignore adaptive and mitigating behavior [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], so perhaps they should be understood as a ceiling for the negative impacts. For example, CC impacts would be lower if one considers that agronomic adaptation is expected to increase yields by 15â€“18% [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We also learn from these models that it would be a mistake to stop at the yields effects to predict impacts on human welfare, because there are large predicted responses (adaptation) in production and trade as a response to climate shocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; an argument that is furthered in this paper. In this respect, the large-scale gridded models proposed by [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] represent an important improvement in the right direction, by using a Ricardian land-value based approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which assumes farmers adapt their best production strategy according to climate change. These models predict a more moderate impact of CC as compared to global gridded models.
