The fourth section of the paper presents a brief summary of the results of the complete microsimulation model. Following the robust results that climate driven changes in yields have a minor impact on vulnerability to food insecurity, the fifth section of this paper unravels the characteristics of Peru and the transmission mechanisms that explain these low impacts; and; explore which policies could have a greater impact in reducing food insecurity in contexts of hunger prevalence. The final section concludes.</p>
