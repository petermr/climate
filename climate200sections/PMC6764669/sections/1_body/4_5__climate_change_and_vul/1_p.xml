<p>In the following section we reconcile two seemingly contradictory results observed in this study: the considerable impact of CC on yields, but the moderate impact on vulnerability to food insecurity. This exercise involves identifying the factors that mediate the relationship between climate change and food security vulnerability. First, we discuss characteristics (biophysical and socioeconomic) that impact the results observed and are exclusive to Peru; and second, we identify characteristics that are specific to the way in which the impacts of CC are generally transmitted to vulnerability to hunger.</p>
