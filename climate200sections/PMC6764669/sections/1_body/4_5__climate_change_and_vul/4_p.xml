<p>Moreover, in Peru and elsewhere in the world, the impact of changes in agricultural yields on welfare are mediated by the markets and mitigating activities the households perform. CC, as modeled in this study, impacts household incomes through the value of agricultural production that can increase or diminish as a result of climate driven changes in agricultural productivity. This means that the impact that climate change could have on salaries (agricultural) are ignored, but at the rural level only 8% of income is derived from agricultural salaries, which shows that at the aggregated level (not necessarily locally), the impact of changes in agricultural salaries on vulnerability would be greatly reduced. However, as shown in
