<p>This paper has established that CC has a moderate impact on vulnerability to food insecurity. Given that we have all the information, we close this analysis by opening the discussion of what are therefore, the main drivers of vulnerability in this context of CC. We open this question with an estimation of the determinants of vulnerability with a probit model of the binary outcome, vulnerable or not, against the same set of household-head characteristics, household characteristics, and location features used to estimate the caloric consumption model above (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The full model is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222483.s006">S5 Table</xref>, while 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>, summarizes the variables with the highest marginal impact on vulnerability. It is important know which factors are most important in determining vulnerability to hunger, as some of these characteristics can be impacted with public policy, to support vulnerable families in dealing with CC as well as other shocks that rural families face each season.
