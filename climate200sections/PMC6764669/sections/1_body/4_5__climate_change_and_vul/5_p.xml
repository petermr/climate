<p>First are agricultural markets. When the agricultural supply expands or contracts due to changes in productivity, the changes in demand are mediated by prices. For example, if supply falls 20%, prices should increase, moderating the negative impact of the fall in production on incomes. Later, if a crop shows a permanent reduction in its yield, the rational response of the farmer is to change the crop. It is for that reason that the selection of an optimum bundle of crops is another mediating mechanism on the impact of changes in productivity of crops. If agriculture in general has lost competitiveness due to negative impacts on its productivity, the natural response of a household is to change employment decisions and to increase the effort spent on non-agricultural activities, to the detriment of time spent on agricultural activities. Finally, if we look specifically at impacts on undernourishment, households have another mechanism to mitigate negative impacts, which is to alter their diets by consuming cheaper calories (generally cereals) and less expensive calories (fruits, vegetables, and animal proteins).</p>
