<p>In thinking about policies that combat food insecurity in the context of CC it is important to note the limitations of the modeling efforts, like the one presented here that link climate information with agricultural production from household surveys. On the one hand there are climate modeling limitations, which are highly relevant for modeling agricultural response. Climate change models, like ESM used in this report, do not consider changes in extreme events patterns (like hurricanes, El Ni√±o events, or other). These extreme events may revert estimated impacts on yields, and likely require different policy responses than those considered here. The way that climate impacts household-level agricultural productivity can also be made more precise. For example, in the case of Peru, crops can be divided by eco-region-specific crops, and separate yield equations could be estimated. Finally, it is important to consider the effects of CC downstream from agriculture. The model presented here does not consider sector-wide employment impacts of CC, effects on employment and wages in the non-agricultural sectors. The latter could be significant, specifically through agricultural growth multiplier effects in less developed countries where agriculture is a large sector of GDP.</p>
