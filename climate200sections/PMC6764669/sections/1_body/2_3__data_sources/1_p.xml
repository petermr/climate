<p>The objective of this multidisciplinary study requires the compatible use of distinct information sources, as is described here. The data used comes from four principal sources: 1) The National Household Survey (ENAHO, INEI) (four rounds, between 2005 and 2012); 2) Special anthropometric module (ENAHO 2012, INEI); 3) Historic climate data; multiple meteorological seasons (SENAMHI, National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology), and; 4) Future climate scenarios from three different Global Climate Model (ESMs) projections, downscaled to Peru in 10km grids.</p>
