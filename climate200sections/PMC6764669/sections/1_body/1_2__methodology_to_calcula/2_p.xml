<p>To measure the impacts of CC on wellbeing, we propose a measurement that adequately reflects the consequences on food security due to the high prevalence of hunger in rural Peru. Improved estimates prepared for this study show that 32% of the rural population in 2012 suffered from food shortage or caloric deficit. A possible indicator is the prevalence of caloric deficit (also referred to as undernourishment), the percentage of people that are below the minimum caloric requirements established for each sex/age group according to anthropometry. The caloric deficit measured at a certain point in time reveals the nutritional state in a static form, which can be influenced by negative shocks, like a bad harvest or seasonal unemployment, or positive shocks as well. The changes in climate, on the other hand, manifest themselves over the mid and long term, for which we would want an indicator of wellbeing that better reflects the reality of the household over the long-term. We choose the vulnerability to undernourishment as a dependent variable, as this measurement eliminates the positive and negative shocks of the households, to deliver the expected wellbeing of the household over the long term, and captures the capacity of the household to resist and confront adverse circumstances, such as CC. Also, vulnerability better reflects the dynamic nature of food security, unlike poverty food security is a dynamic concept, as its definition indicates: having enough food at all times. Following [
