<p>To estimate the caloric consumption of household

 </sub>, an explanatory model (in reduced form) is presented whose main determinants are agricultural income

 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub> (the production of the household valued at market prices), and the non-agricultural income 
 <italic>y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>nf</italic>
 </sub>. This model faces the challenges of isolating the decision of agricultural production from the decision of consumption,

 <italic>g</italic>. navigating the evident econometric problem of endogeneity between agricultural income and caloric consumption and addressing the heteroscedasticity present in caloric consumption, as by definition we know that less (more) vulnerable households present a lower (higher) variability in their consumption. To face these different challenges the estimation of vulnerability of each household is carried out in three main steps as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222483.g002">Fig 2</xref>. First, yields are estimated as a function of climate and inputs; from yields we estimate farm income and weather driven variability of yields which are used to estimate consumption and its variance in the second step, and; in a third step estimated consumption and its variance is used to estimate household-level vulnerability.
