<p>In the first step, agricultural incomes (

 </sub>) are estimated and predicted through an econometric model that explains agricultural yields. Step (I) is implicitly the first stage of an instrumental variables (IV) approach to the estimation of consumption in the second step. The IV model deals with endogeneity between caloric consumption and agricultural income. The model includes, among other things, agricultural inputs, characteristics of the producer, geographic characteristics, and climatic variables. Climatic variables are the primary instruments in predicting the agricultural income that is used in the second step. They represent good instruments as climate is highly correlated to yields (and therefore agricultural income), but it is not strongly correlated with consumption (criteria of exclusion). In addition to solving the problem of endogeneity between consumption and agricultural income, this first model delivers the mechanism by which to simulate CC impacts on the caloric consumption of the household. The predicted agricultural income (

 </inline-formula>), which is approximated by the variability of agricultural yields that is due to climatic variables. As explained below with the case of consumption, household-level yield variance can be estimated from the difference between observed and predicted yields. To estimate climate-driven risk, we regress household-level yield variance against climate variables, and use this predicted variance as a measure of climate-driven yield risk.
