Asymmetric effects of rainfall on population dynamics of species within and across trophic levels have consequences for the structure of the whole community. Climate change has far reaching effects on ecological processes ranging from effects on individual species to entire ecosystems (Harrington et al.

Our study emphasizes the importance of rainfall in understanding the effects of climate change on ecological responses in trophic chains and broader ecological communities. Future experiments should investigate combined effects of climate‐related factors on plant–insect as well as multitrophic interactions.
