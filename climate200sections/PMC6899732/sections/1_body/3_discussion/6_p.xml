<p>Sugar concentrations declined significantly in response to rain, but only during early development of plants before the insects were feeding on them. Sugar concentrations were also lower in leaf tissues that had been exposed to herbivory, especially feeding by 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> reduced foliar sugar concentrations. Previous studies have shown that plant nutrients can be leached from leaf tissues by rainfall (Tukey

 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Moreover, damaged leaves of plants are much more susceptible to leaching than undamaged leaves (Tukey 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">1970</xref>). Feeding damage by 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars is more severe than feeding by 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> caterpillar
 <italic>s</italic> and this could explain the lower sugar concentration in leaf tissues damaged by the former herbivore species. Sugars such as sucrose and glucose are important feeding stimulants (Schoonhoven et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). To what extent the reduced sugar concentrations and leaching of nutrients in general explain extended development and changes in other fitness correlates of insect herbivores feeding on rain‐exposed plants merits further investigation. In addition, changes in nitrogen, a very important nutrient that is usually very low in plant tissues, and changes in morphological traits should be considered to better understand how abiotic factors influence the nutritional quality for and resistance to insect herbivores.
