<p>In both species, extended larval development time coincided with adults being heavier, but only in the experiment in which the caterpillars were exposed to three short downpour events. This effect was more prominent for 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> than for 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic>. In contrast, although development time of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>brassicae</italic> was also extended when exposed to a single rain event per day, adults in this treatment group were lighter. In a previous study (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> exposed to wind developed slower but attained more biomass. Predation of caterpillars by birds (Great Tits) was considerably reduced when reared on plants exposed to wind. We speculated that this phenotypic shift to a prolonged developmental program might be an adaptive response to reduced predation risk that is perceived by the feeding caterpillars that benefit significantly from larger size in terms of fecundity (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Whether a similar scenario could hold for increased exposure to rain remains to be investigated. Heavy downpours are not only likely to have direct effects on insect herbivores, but on their natural enemies as well. Studies with birds (Robbins

 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) and parasitoids (Fink and Völkl 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>) showed a significant decrease in foraging activity of these natural enemies during rainy periods. If rainfall is also perceived by herbivores as reducing predation risk, as it does with wind, then this might explain trade‐offs between traits such as development time and body size. However, the result of this study suggests that abiotic factors such as rainfall need to be prolonged or more frequent in order to induce phenotypic shifts, as this phenomenon was only observed in the experiment in which rainfall frequency was increased to three times per day.
