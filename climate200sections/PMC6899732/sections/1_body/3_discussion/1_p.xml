<p>Simulated rainfall, which mimicked downpours occurring during thunderstorms, had a profound direct negative effect on the survival of 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, and this effect was stronger when the frequency of downpour events increased from one to three daily. By contrast, the survival of 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> was marginally affected, but only in the single downpour experiment. Direct exposure of insects on plants to downpours also increased development time of the two herbivores, whereas the effects of downpours on adult body mass were more idiosyncratic. In spite of significant changes in leaf chemistry, indirect, plant‐mediated effects of downpours on the performance, i.e., development time and adult biomass, of the two specialist insects were generally small.
