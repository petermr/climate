<p>When downpours occurred once a day, total sugar concentration in leaf tissues was affected by downpour regime and herbivory (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Sugar concentrations were lower in plants exposed to downpours during phase 1 than in plants not exposed to downpours during this phase (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,20</sub> = 18.3, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001), whereas downpours during phase 2 did not significantly reduce sugar concentrations further (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,20</sub> = 2.82, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.11). Feeding by the herbivores reduced foliar sugar and this effect was stronger for 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> than for 
 <italic>P. xylostella,</italic> irrespective of downpour regime (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.05). In the second experiment with three downpours per day, the effects of downpour regime and herbivory were similar but less significant than in the first experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d).
