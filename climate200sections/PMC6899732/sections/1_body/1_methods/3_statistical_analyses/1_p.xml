<p>Data (insect performance, chemistry) from the two experiments in which different frequencies of downpours were applied were analyzed separately. We used downpours during phase 1 (yes/no) and during phase 2 (yes/no) and their interaction terms as factors in the analyses to separate direct and indirect effects of rainfall. Effects of rainfall treatments on survival of 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae from L2 to pupation and for 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> from L1 to the adult eclosion were analyzed using generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function, with downpour treatments and their interactions as fixed factors. Development time from L2 (
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic>) or L1 (
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic>) to adulthood and adult body mass of the herbivores were analyzed using general linear mixed models with the same fixed factors as for the analysis of insect survival and blocks as a random factor. Data on sinigrin (the dominant GS in 
 <italic>B. nigra</italic>, comprising &gt;99% of the GS content) and total sugar concentrations in leaf tissues were also analyzed using general linear mixed models. In addition to terms included in the models above, herbivory treatment was included as well (none, 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, or 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic>). Temperatures measured three times in each block during the second experiment were analyzed using a general linear mixed model with downpour regime, time and their interactions as fixed factors. Blocks and date were entered as random factors. Multiple comparisons were conducted when any of the model terms were significant (Tukey‐adjusted comparison). All analyses were performed in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team
