<p>Simulated downpours were expected to affect the microclimate. Therefore, we measured the temperature of the leaf surface of plants in the middle of each block using a thermo‐detector (Bosch PTD 1, Leinfelden‐Echterdingen, Germany) during the second experiment. Temperatures were measured three times; before, immediately after, and 1 h after the second downpour on four consecutive days during phase 2.</p>
