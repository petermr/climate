<p>We hypothesize that (1) the direct effects of intensive rainfall such as physical disturbance and changes in microclimate negatively affect herbivore performance and (2) the direct effects of downpours are stronger than the indirect plant‐mediated effects. To determine how chemical traits in the plants are affected by downpours we measured glucosinolate and sugar concentrations, representatives of primary and secondary metabolites, respectively. Both groups of plant metabolites are considered important for insect performance (Scriber and Slansky

Our results are discussed in relation to the effects of predicted changes in extreme weather events on insect–plant interactions in Europe under Anthropogenic Global Warming projected by the IPCC (
