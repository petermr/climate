<p>Here, we examined the effects of simulated heavy short‐term rainfall exposure on the survival and development of the same two herbivore species 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> and 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, on one of their important natural food plants, 
 <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (L.) (Brassicales: Brassicaceae). In a first experiment performed in a greenhouse, we simulated short (20 min) daily downpours like those that accompany thunderstorms. In a second experiment, we increased the frequency (three) and at the same time reduced the length (5 min) of the daily downpours to determine whether the effects on the herbivore differ when exposed to these two different downpour conditions. We hypothesize that more frequent disturbance by triple daily downpour events would have a stronger impact on the plants and the herbivores than a single long downpour event. In an attempt to separate direct and indirect, i.e., plant‐mediated, effects of downpours on insect development and survival, rainfall regimes were applied during growth of the plants before (phase 1) and after insects were introduced and were feeding on the plants (phase 2). Plants in the two experiments were exposed to one of four rainfall regimes: (1) no rain, (2) only rain during phase 1, (3) only rain during phase 2, and (4) rain during both phases. Whereas the effects of rain during phase 1 on caterpillars feeding during phase 2 clearly represent indirect, plant‐mediated effects, effects of rain during phase 2 will mainly represent direct effects on caterpillars, but could include some plant‐mediated effects as well. Given the relative short duration of the second phase, for simplicity, we will refer to phase‐2 effects as direct effects.
