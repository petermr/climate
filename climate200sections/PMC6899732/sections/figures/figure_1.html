 <caption> Schematic diagram of the design of the simulated downpour experiment. Downpour‐exposure treatments were applied during growth of the plants (phase 1) and while insects were feeding on the plant (phase 2). There were four treatments: (1) no downpours (R00, the two digits refer to phase 1 and 2, respectively, 0, no rain, 1, rain), (2) downpours during phase 1 (R10), (3) during phase 2 (R01), and (4) during both phases (R11). These four precipitation regimes allowed us to separate the indirect, plant‐mediated effects of downpours on the herbivores (R10, R11 vs. R00, R01) from predominantly direct effects (R01, R11 vs. R00, R10). The positions of the downpour treatments in the greenhouse, denoted by shower symbols, were set but tables were moved as indicated by the arrows at the transition from phase 1 to phase 2. Plants were placed on tables (replicate) with nine plants of which three were infested with L2 larvae of Plutella xylostella, four were infested with L1 larvae of Pieris brassicae, and two served as control (no herbivores). Assignment of treatments to plants within a table was randomized. </caption>
