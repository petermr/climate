<p>Empirical studies on linkages between climate and security conceptualize environmental exposures in a variety of ways, including extreme weather events (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c86" ref-type="bibr">Schleussner et al. 2016</xref>), short-term changes in temperature or precipitation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Devlin and Hendrix 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c79" ref-type="bibr">Raleigh et al. 2015</xref>), and longer-term (generally multidecadal) trends in temperature or precipitation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">Devlin and Hendrix 2014</xref>). Others use climate-sensitive impacts such as food production (e.g.,

 <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Buhaug et al. 2015</xref>) or economic variables (e.g., food prices, which are climate-sensitive but also affected by market- and governance-related factors) to understand interactions between climate variability, socioeconomic factors, and related impacts on social stability (
 <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix and Haggard 2015</xref>). In this literature, shorter time series of years to decades are often examined, with the results extrapolated to assess the potential impacts of longer-term climate change. In general, with some variability and inconsistency (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c83" ref-type="bibr">Salehyan 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Buhaug 2015</xref>), this literature finds that both short-term shocks, such as natural disasters and associated losses of livelihood opportunities, as well as longer-term stressors, such as growing scarcity of resources associated with drought, can increase the risk of instability (
