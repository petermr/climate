<p>Although many studies find relationships between weather or economic variables and security impacts, a gap exists in understanding relevant pathways or mechanisms (

Importantly, the literature on climate and conflict is biased as a result of sampling strategies that are convenience-based, potentially leading to inappropriate conclusions regarding the strength and robustness of climate change and social stability relationships (
