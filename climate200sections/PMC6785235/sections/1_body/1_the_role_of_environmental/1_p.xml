<p>The environmental health literature discusses varied relationships between climate change and human health outcomes, including through mechanisms such as thermal extremes, infectious disease, food shortages, and nutrient deficiencies (

As with the relationships between climate change and social stability, other factors moderate the relationships between climate factors and health outcomes. Most notably, socioeconomic development and health systems (the people, policies, organizations, and resources needed for disease prevention and health protection) play a critical role in influencing whether climate-related threats become more widespread population health challenges (
 <xref rid="c87" ref-type="bibr">Sellers and Ebi 2018</xref>). Additionally, extreme weather events associated with climate change may threaten physical infrastructure, making it challenging to provide continuous care in cases where buildings are damaged or destroyed (
 <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">Balbus et al. 2016</xref>) or when system function is impaired, as was the case with Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria (
 <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">Kishore et al. 2018</xref>). Moreover, when extreme events occur, reconstruction can be a challenge because property insurance coverage is often limited in many low- and middle-income settings, and rebuilding public health infrastructure is burdensome for cash-strapped governments.
