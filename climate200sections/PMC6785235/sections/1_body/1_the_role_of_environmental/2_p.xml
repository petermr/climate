<p>Although literature linking climate change with human health and with national security exists, very little research addresses the three issues together, with the notable exception of research linking infectious disease and conflict. Climate change may increase the range of many infectious diseases, depending on local climate conditions, demographic patterns, and land use factors (
 <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick and Randolph 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Altizer et al. 2013</xref>). Key mechanisms through which infectious disease can precipitate conflict and instability include: 
 <italic>a</italic>) changing the balance of power between states by affecting national wealth, 
 <italic>b</italic>) creating disputes between governments over how to manage infectious disease outbreaks, and 
 <italic>c</italic>) weakening domestic governance capacity (
 <xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr">Peterson 2002</xref>). A vicious cycle may result among climate change, social instability, and infectious disease outbreaks (
 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">Beldomenico and Begon 2010</xref>). Climate change may weaken state governance and health system capacity, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks, which in turn may result in instability that further weakens state institutions, increasing the risks of future outbreaks, and so forth (
 <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">Letendre et al. 2010</xref>). International coordination to reduce pathogen risks is feasible but often very challenging (
 <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al. 2015</xref>), and critiqued as disproportionately benefitting high-income countries (
