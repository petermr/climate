<p>Concerning the mechanisms that may trigger instability or unrest, the following eight categories and examples encapsulate the key pathways: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Disruptive migration flows:</bold> Rapid and large-scale migration can prove destabilizing to receiving societies, due to distrust of the newcomers, resentment against the resources expended on migrants, or cultural or ethnic differences between migrants and established populations (
    <xref rid="c80" ref-type="bibr">Reuveny 2007</xref>). As evidenced by recent large-scale flows of migrants into Europe, driven in part by environmental factors, rapid migration can also strain institutions. For instance, many migrants there are experiencing uncertainty about their legal status due to difficulties and delays in processing (
    <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">Kersch and Mishtal 2016</xref>), as well as challenges in accessing important services, such as health care (
    <xref rid="c99" ref-type="bibr">van Loenen et al. 2018</xref>), slowing integration and worsening outcomes for migrants and receiving societies.
   </p>

   <p>
    <bold>Changes in the balance of power:</bold> Changes in power balances within and between nation-states may trigger instability. Increases in the relative access to resources of one group may result in rebel violence, for instance (
    <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">Bagozzi et al. 2017</xref>). International relations scholars who take a realist position argue that states seek to maximize their military and economic strength relative to other nations, as that strength best ensures their national security (
    <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">Mearsheimer 1994</xref>). If a climate shock undermines a country’s ability to compete economically, through adverse demographic, health, and economic impacts, this change may affect a country’s relative gains over other states, potentially increasing the long-term risk of interstate conflict.
   </p>
   <p>Among subnational groups, resource concentration potentially increases the risk of localized conflict (
    <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">Adano et al. 2012</xref>). For example, research on pastoral cattle raids in Kenya found that when rainfall patterns in one year disproportionately benefitted a particular tribe, that benefit provided them with motivation to expand their gains in resources through the use of cattle raids. At the same time, tribes that did not benefit from rainfall patterns were motivated to raid because of relative poverty and a need to survive, leading to changing resource distributions motivating raids from two perspectives (
    <xref rid="c85" ref-type="bibr">Schilling et al. 2012</xref>).
   </p>

  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Changes in government leadership or policy:</bold> Shifts in government leadership or policy direction can affect the probability of unrest. In examining different vulnerabilities to social unrest, researchers note that government policies that mitigated increases in resource prices, such as food or fuel subsidies or price controls, reduced the risk of conflict (
    <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">Berazneva and Lee 2013</xref>; 
    <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix and Haggard 2015</xref>). In particular, democracies, where policies may be less stable due to more frequent changes in governments and where often inbuilt preferences toward rural constituencies exist, experience a greater risk of unrest when food prices increase (
    <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix and Haggard 2015</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Changes in income-generating opportunities:</bold> Difficulties in earning income, due to crop or livestock losses or a reduction in the abundance of natural resources or ecosystem services used to sustain livelihoods, can result in household-level economic challenges and potentially generate instability, particularly if abundance elsewhere incentivizes migration. Strong deviations in environmental factors directly associated with livelihoods, such as rainfall, are associated with civil unrest (
    <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">Hendrix and Salehyan 2012</xref>). States with poor human capital profiles or imbalanced age structures may be at greater risk of instability if their populations are unable to shift livelihood activities away from those heavily affected by climate shocks.

   <p>
    <bold>Changes in resource prices:</bold> Changes in resource prices (as measured in cash or in time to collect or access resources), and distinct from changes in opportunities to generate income, are also a key trigger of instability. Importantly, unlike changes in income-generating opportunities that are generally affected by spatially proximate climate shocks, resource prices may be affected by climate shocks elsewhere. Increases in food prices (although not necessarily food price volatility) are often associated with increases in unrest (
    <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2014</xref>; 
    <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">Bellemare 2015</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Disease outbreak/health scare:</bold> Although infectious disease outbreaks can trigger interstate conflict, domestic civil unrest can also result from sudden health scares. For instance, during the 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, health workers were repeatedly attacked by local mobs, in part from pervasive distrust of health professionals and the rapid spread of misinformation about the disease (
    <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">Cohn and Kutalek 2016</xref>). Little imagination is needed to envision similar forms of unrest occurring during other disease outbreaks associated with increases in the geographic range, seasonality, or intensity of transmission of climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

    <bold>Changes in temperature or rainfall:</bold> Changes in temperature or rainfall are the most widely studied proximate factors driving instability or conflict, often because those changes serve as proxies for agricultural income or access to resources. However, beyond this important link, scholars have also argued that changes in temperature or seasonality may directly affect the magnitude and location of violence. For instance, studies from urban settings in the United States and South Africa note that higher temperatures are associated with increased rates of crime, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities (
    <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">Breetzke and Cohn 2011</xref>; 
    <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">Mares 2013</xref>).

  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Extreme weather events:</bold> Separate from changes in temperature or rainfall, large-scale disasters such as hurricanes can have material effects on health and social stability. For instance, after Hurricane Katrina, the lack of law enforcement and effects of displacement resulted in increased rates of gender-based violence (
    <xref rid="c95" ref-type="bibr">Thornton and Voigt 2007</xref>; 
    <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">Anastario et al. 2009</xref>). However, in other circumstances, disasters may reduce the likelihood of violence. In the Philippines, typhoons reduced recruiting for rebel groups by disrupting supply lines and organizational hierarchy (
