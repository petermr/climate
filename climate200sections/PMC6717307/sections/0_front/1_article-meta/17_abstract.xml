 <title>Significance</title>
 <p>More intense extreme events are projected under future climate change. However, the impacts of climate extremes on future air quality and associated health implications are not well recognized and are rarely quantified in China, with an enormous health burden from air pollution. Here, we estimate the climate-driven air pollution mortality in China and find that future climate change is likely to exacerbate air pollution mortality, largely influenced by the more intense extreme events such as stagnation events and heat waves. Our analysis provides quantitative assessments and insights regarding the links between climate extremes, future air quality, and public health, suggesting that extreme weather events may be an important mechanism by which climate change will affect air quality, and especially fine particulate matter.</p>
