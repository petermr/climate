  <p>Climate-induced air pollution-related mortality according to climate mechanism and cause in the 8 regions of China. Changes in air pollution deaths related to climate change under RCP4.5 are shown from current (2006 to 2010) to future (2046 to 2050) years in different regions of China, according to climate mechanism (
   <italic>A</italic>) and cause of death (
   <italic>B</italic>). The total climate-induced air pollution-related mortality is plotted as blue diamonds. Error bars denote 95% CIs, determined by uncertainties in the RRs. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Climate mechanisms are changes in mean climate state (excluding extremes, nonextreme changes), extreme-induced additional changes from heat waves, heavy precipitation, atmospheric stagnation, and the residuals due to compound extremes. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Causes are respiratory disease, lung cancer, COPD, stroke, and IHD.
