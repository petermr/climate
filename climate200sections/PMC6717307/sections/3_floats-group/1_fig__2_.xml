 <caption>
  <p>Projected multiyear mean changes in air quality due to climate change and the associated health impacts in China. Projected changes in mean annual PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations (
   <italic>A</italic>) and the ozone season average of daily 1-h maximum ozone (
   <italic>B</italic>) over East Asia related to climate change under RCP4.5 are shown from current (2006 to 2010) to future (2046 to 2050) years. The estimated changes in annual mortality in China due to the climate-related changes in PM
   <sub>2.5</sub> (
   <italic>C</italic>) and ozone (
   <italic>D</italic>) exposure are shown. The dots in 
   <italic>A</italic> and 
   <italic>B</italic> denote areas where changes are statistically significant at the 90% level, as determined by a Studentâ€™s 2-sample 
   <italic>t</italic> test.
