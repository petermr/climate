<p>Second, although we evaluate error in our mortality estimates related to the uncertain integrated exposure responses (i.e., uncertainty in the relative risk [RR]; details are provided in 
 <italic>Methods</italic>), our projections assume no change in population size, age structure, or location. This assumption allows a direct evaluation of the effects of climate change apart from any demographic changes. However, in order to assess the potential sensitivity of our results to this assumption, we conducted further analyses using scenarios of future population and age structure. We find that greater vulnerability of Chinaâ€™s aging population will further increase PM
