<p>The regional simulations were conducted for 5 current years (2006 to 2010, current climate) and 5 future years (2046 to 2050, future climate). They were driven by the CESM-NCSU downscaled climate under RCP4.5, keeping anthropogenic air pollutant emissions and boundary conditions constant at the current levels. The regional modeling system was applied in East Asia with a horizontal grid resolution of 36 km. Future climate change and its impacts on air quality in China are estimated from the difference between the future climate simulation and the current climate simulation. The future climate simulation used the same configurations as the current climate simulation except for the changing climate under RCP4.5. The RCP4.5 pathway is selected for this study because it represents a relatively medium climate scenario. The background mixing ratios of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and CH
 <sub>4</sub> are changed in the radiation scheme, from 378 parts per million (ppm) and 1,754 ppb in current years to 474 ppm and 1,840 ppb under RCP4.5 in future years, respectively, but are held fixed in the chemistry scheme at the CMAQâ€™s default (current) levels. Natural emissions, including biogenic volatile organic compounds, windblown dust, and soil and lightning nitrogen oxides, were climate-dependent and in-line calculated within the 2-way coupled WRF-CMAQ.
