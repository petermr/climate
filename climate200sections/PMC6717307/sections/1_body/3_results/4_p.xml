<p>As previously noted, climate-related changes in air temperature, shortwave radiation, water vapor, precipitation, wind speed, planetary boundary layer height, and cloud fraction can explain some of the changes in pollution concentrations. We present further correlation analyses between changes in ozone and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations and these meteorological variables in

 </ext-link> illustrates that the increase in ozone concentrations is generally associated with the increase in temperature and the decrease in precipitation, while the increase in PM

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref> shows widespread and substantial changes in the frequency of extreme events that affect air quality from current (2006 to 2010) to future (2046 to 2050) years under RCP4.5. For example, the average frequency of heat waves across China increases from 2.7 d/y in current years to 8.8 d/y in future years (
