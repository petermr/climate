 </xref> shows estimated changes in air pollution deaths due to the climate-related changes in PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and ozone exposure. The regional distribution of these health impacts in China resembles the concentration changes, but emphasizes densely populated and already polluted areas. Indeed, although climate change increases air pollution deaths in all of the 8 regions of China, 90% of the additional deaths are projected to occur in areas that represent just 20% of Chinaâ€™s land area, with nearly half of the additional deaths in the populous north and east regions. Although climate change is projected to decrease PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>-related deaths in the south, these benefits are completely offset by ozone-related deaths in that region. Although air quality in many areas of western China is projected to improve, the health benefits are less pronounced because of the sparse population.
