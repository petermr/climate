<p>In turn, we see that such climate extremes have a large influence on deadly air pollution events in the future. For example, our projections show that the number of days in 74 major cities of China with winter PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations great than 150 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> and 250 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> (equivalent to the heavily polluted and severe polluted levels, respectively, according to the Air Quality Index in China; ref. 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) increases by 1.8 d (11%) and 1.1 d (42%), respectively, and we find that atmospheric stagnation events account for more than 70% of these high-PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> days and dominate these increases (
