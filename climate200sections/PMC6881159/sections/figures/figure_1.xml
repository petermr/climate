  <title>Alteration of trophic relationships depending on responses to climate change.</title>
  <p>Arrows indicate CO
   <sub>2</sub> flow; solid arrows represent net input, and dashed arrows represent net output, with arrow thickness proportional to flow. Circles show different species in a simplified soil food web. The unperturbed system prior to the onset of a chronic global change driver (
   <bold>A</bold>) gives way to a long-term response (
   <bold>B</bold>) in which poorly performing plant species and their pathogens or symbionts are lost from the system, and new, more competitive plant species that have escaped their natural enemies are added to the community. As a result, the biomass of nonspecialist mutualists or pathogens increases, and the biomass of one decomposer group remains high [modified from (
