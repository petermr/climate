<p>In addition to leaf litter, rhizodeposition is a large source of organic matter entering the soil that will be affected by climate change. Rhizodeposits are highly dependent on plant physiological activity, which will be affected by expected changes in climate. Changes in exudate composition, not just quantity, may also have crucial impacts on soil properties and organisms. Under drought, plants exudate more secondary compounds (including antioxidants), phytohormones, soluble sugars and compounds that act as osmolytes (

 </xref>) that buffer the cellular redox status during drought. Drought-driven changes in rhizodeposition, thus, have complex effects on bacterial and fungal communities. The changes depend on the intensity of the drought and previous soil history. Bacteria may be more negatively affected than fungi in terms of biomass stock. The resulting shift toward a relative increase in fungi and a relative decrease in the biomass and diversity of bacteria (

Thus, climate change impacts on plant-soil interactions will have consequences for the carbon cycle, and a potential decoupling of plant-soil interactions may happen as if plants undergo a range shift while their associated soil communities do not. This decoupling is a largely unrecognized, but potentially important, regulator of the future global carbon cycle (
