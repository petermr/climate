<p>We have so far referred mostly to climate, but the direct effects of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> (eCO
 <sub>2</sub>) may be important as well. In addition, any effect of climate change on PSFs will happen within the context of rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> effects on PSFs; hence, consideration of both direct CO
 <sub>2</sub> and direct and indirect effects of climate change seems essential to develop a holistic, integrated perspective. A critical question involving the impacts of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on PSFs is whether eCO
 <sub>2</sub> stimulates the soil community to increase the rates of decomposition and associated N and phosphorus (P) cycling through increased plant productivity, or has neutral or negative effects on decomposition and nutrient cycling. The former PSFs allow the responses of plant biomass to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> to remain stable or grow stronger (the “priming” effect), whereas the latter PSFs contribute to, and perhaps increase, the extent of the constraints of nutrient limitation on the use of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> by plants. This is a major puzzle in eCO
 <sub>2</sub> science because many kinds of effects, for instance, increased, neutral, or decreased soil nutrient cycling in response to eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, have been reported (

 </xref>–

 </xref>). This puzzle is also a key issue for society, and the questions of whether or how much the direct effects of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> stimulate a negative feedback from terrestrial ecosystems that reduces the rate of global warming [by additional carbon (C) sequestration] are poorly understood. This sequestration requires an increase in C uptake by plants and a neutral, negative, or positive return of C to soil (by autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration) that is smaller than the uptake. Soil microbes play a key role both because they control the supply of nutrients to plants and thus the magnitude of increase in the response of biomass to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and because they determine the rate of decomposition of both new and old C in soils.
