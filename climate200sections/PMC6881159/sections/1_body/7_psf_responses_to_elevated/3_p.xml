<p>Plant species associated with EM fungi have a stronger response of biomass to elevated eCO
 <sub>2</sub> when soil has more available N, whereas plant species associated with AM fungi increase biomass more under eCO
 <sub>2</sub> when soils have more available P (
 <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>100</italic>
 </xref>). These responses are partly due to the lower cost and thus higher return on investment for acquiring additional N under eCO
 <sub>2</sub> when associating with EM rather than AM fungi (
 <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>100</italic>
 </xref>). EM plants, however, decrease soil C pools via priming (i.e., the stimulation or suppression of soil organic matter decomposition by live roots and associated rhizosphere organisms) (
