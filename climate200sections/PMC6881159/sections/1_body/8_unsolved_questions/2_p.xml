<p>Similarly, important gaps remain in our understanding of specific aspects of climate change, such as the relative and interactive effects of warming and CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment on these links, and how they are influenced by the rapidly increasing extreme meteorological events such as drought, floods, and altered freeze-thaw cycles. Last, further studies are needed to determine how PSFs can be promoted to control potential invasiveness of range-expanding native and introduced exotic alien plant species or their use in practical issues such as nature-based solutions or natural climate solutions (

Addressing this issue requires studies that explore the interactions of climate and succession, and there is a dearth of these studies at present.
