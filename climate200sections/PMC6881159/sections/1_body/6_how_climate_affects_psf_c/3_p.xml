<p>At a broad level of resolution, the types of above- and belowground biotic changes that occur during succession and ecosystem development appear to be relatively constant among regions that experience very different climatic regimes (

 </xref>). Therefore, the biggest effects of climate change in driving how soil biota and PSFs affect succession are likely to be driven by finer-scale factors such as what types of plants in any given environment will or will not be favored by future climate. For example, shrub encroachment of subarctic tundra resulting from climate change (

  <italic>92</italic>
 </xref>) involves successional pathways moving toward domination by woody plants that show positive feedbacks with ericoid and EM fungi. Conversely, in some temperate regions, warming should lead to successional pathways involving domination by trees that undergo feedbacks with AM fungi rather than with EM and saprophytic fungi (

 </xref>). Increasing aridity in tropical regions may promote early successional species that form positive associations with N-fixing bacteria (

 </xref>,

  <italic>95</italic>
 </xref>), thereby eventually benefitting later successional species. There are numerous examples of where specific plant functional types are likely to enter or exit successional pathways due to climate change, and while each of these will have their own feedbacks with their associated soil biota, the nature and direction of these feedbacks are likely to be case specific. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this context dependency is key to understanding and predicting how successional pathways develop under a changing global climate and, therefore, the dominant types of vegetation that are likely to result.
