<p>Although we have some understanding of how PSFs influence plant succession, we have limited knowledge on how these effects are mediated by climate or how they might be altered by ongoing climate change. Explicitly addressing this issue will require studies that directly consider the interactive effects of macroclimatic variables and succession; few studies have used such an approach (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>), and none of them have explicitly studied PSFs. However, the work by Laliberté 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>89</italic>
 </xref>) does offer some insights. Here, plant biomass and the structure of the soil food web were investigated across each of the four parallel chronosequences formed on the same parent material in Western Australia; these four sequences differ in both temperature and moisture balance within the range of what would be expected for future climate change. They showed that chronosequence stage was the most important driver of the soil food web, with little interactive effect of stage with climate. Given that the soil food web governs nutrient supply rates from the soil, which then affects successional processes, this study suggests that variation in the ecological impact of the soil food web and, ultimately, its impacts of PSFs among (versus within) successional gradients of contrasting climate is probably not large. This study does not, of course, directly address the question about how climate determines the role of PSFs in driving succession, and it remains unknown whether the results of this study are likely to apply to successional gradients elsewhere, but it offers insights into how this question could be explicitly addressed.
