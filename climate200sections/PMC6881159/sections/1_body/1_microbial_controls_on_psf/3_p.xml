<p>Climate change can modify the direction and intensity of microbial-mediated PSFs through a variety of mechanisms. For example, the alteration of soil microbial communities by climatic extremes, such as recurring droughts, can modify both the direction and intensity of PSFs, with consequences for plant-plant interactions and invasiveness (

 </xref>) and presumably influence PSFs. Warming and altered precipitation will also modify PSFs, hence plant-plant interactions, by altering belowground pathogen pressure and root associations with mutualistic symbionts and/or by decoupling range-expanding plants from their host-specific soil communities, including pathogens (

 </xref>). Changes in plant physiology and phenology caused by climate change, although poorly understood, can alter soil microbial communities via changes in rhizodeposition (i.e., the release of resources from plant roots into the soil), thereby potentially modifying the microbial-mediated PSFs (
