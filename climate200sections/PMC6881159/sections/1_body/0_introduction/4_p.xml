<p>By discussing PSFs and climate in combination, and the consequences for feedbacks from vegetation-soil to climate, our overriding goals are to anticipate how climate change may affect plant and soil communities, to derive some generalizations about how a changing climate may affect PSFs and consequences for key community and ecosystem-level properties and climate, as well as to identify important knowledge gaps.</p>
