<p>Plants and soils are inextricably linked. Plants alter soil properties, which, in turn, influence plant performance, displaying a variety of effects on each other. These effects of plants on themselves, their offspring, and other plant species through influences on soil organisms and abiotic soil conditions are termed plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) (

 </xref>). The interaction between plants and their associated soil biota can lead to complex feedbacks that regulate plant community dynamics and ecosystem processes. The net outcome of PSFs on plant growth depends on the balance between antagonistic and beneficial interactions with the extant plant and soil microbial communities, which can vary depending on both biotic (e.g., plant functional traits) and abiotic (e.g., soil pH, physical structure, and nutrient availability) factors (
