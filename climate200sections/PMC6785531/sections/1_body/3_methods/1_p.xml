<p id="Par24">To assess the consequences of climate change on island phylogenetic diversity, we proceeded as follows:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par25">We calculated the vulnerability of each island to three threats related to climate change depending on some island features</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par26">We estimated how much phylogenetic diversity (PD) would be lost on a global scale when an island disappears. As the extent of the loss of PD depends on an islandâ€™s genus richness, we also estimated whether these losses were significant or not, i.e. whether they were higher than by chance alone.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par27">We linked island vulnerability to loss of PD. In particular, we assessed how much PD would be lost when all islands in the same vulnerability category were removed and whether these losses were significant.</p>
