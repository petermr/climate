<p id="Par31">Plant occurrence points were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility portal (GBIF, GBIF.org (09 February 2017) GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.kyylbs). We selected all “basisOfRecord” occurences comprised within the island polygon boundaries, defined in the Global Island Database (GID)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. We used the taxon name structure from eMonocot to account for possible synonymies in the GBIF dataset and attributed an accepted name following the synonymy list in eMonocot for each record. We excluded all marine taxa.
