<p id="Par30">We used a monocot phylogeny that is well resolved at the genus level for the vast majority of genera
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. Working at the genus level allowed us to take into account taxa united by solid shared evolutionary history, materialized by shared traits which made them successful on islands and which are therefore the object of frequent evolutionary and ecological research
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup>. Genera names from this phylogeny were matched with the accepted names found in the eMonocot database and used as a reference to check for the synonymy of plant occurrence names. eMonocot is built by an international consortium of botanists and aims to provide the most reliable information on monocot taxonomy and occurrence.
