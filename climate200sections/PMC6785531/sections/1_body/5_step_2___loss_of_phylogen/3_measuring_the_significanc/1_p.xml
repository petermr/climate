<p id="Par46">As absolute ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> may be correlated with genus richness on an island, we tested whether loss of plant PD on each island was higher than expected by chance. To do so, we randomized genera between islands but kept the genus richness of each island and the range of each genus (i.e. the number of islands a genus is present on). For each island and randomization, we calculated the new ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> when that island is lost. Simulations were run 1000 times. For each island, we then calculated the frequency at which the observed ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was higher than the 1000 ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> values calculated from simulations (p-values
 <sub>ind</sub>; unilateral test). This procedure allowed removing the dependency of ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> on genus richness while retaining the structure of the data. Expected PD losses from the original data were considered highly, moderately or slightly significant when they fell into the highest 0.1%, 1% and 5% of the distribution values obtained from simulations, respectively.
