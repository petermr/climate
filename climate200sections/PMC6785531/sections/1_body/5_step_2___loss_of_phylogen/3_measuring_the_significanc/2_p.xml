<p id="Par47">To identify areas where range-restricted and/or evolutionarily distinct genera co-occur, we also estimated for each island the expected loss of species richness (ExpSR
 <italic>loss</italic>) and the expected loss of species richness in the most evolutionarily distinct species (ExpSR
 <italic>loss</italic>
