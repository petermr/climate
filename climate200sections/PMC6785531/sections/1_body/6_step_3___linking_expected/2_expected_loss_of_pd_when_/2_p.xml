<p id="Par51"> Here we calculated extinction probabilities for each genus as the proportion of their range that would be lost if 
 <italic>all</italic> islands with a similar vulnerability to climate change disappeared (in step 1 the extinction probability was measured as the proportion of a genus range lost when 
 <italic>a single</italic> island disappeared). To explore this question, we defined the “range” of a genus as the number of vulnerability categories of the islands on which it occurs. For example, if a genus occurs 
 <italic>only</italic> on highly vulnerable islands, its extinction probability would be 1 if all these islands were lost. The extinction probability of a genus occurring on islands from three categories (e.g. very high, high, and moderate vulnerability) would be 1/3 under a similar scenario. We then calculated the phylogenetic signal of extinction probabilities for each category of vulnerability and each type of threat using Pagel’s λ
