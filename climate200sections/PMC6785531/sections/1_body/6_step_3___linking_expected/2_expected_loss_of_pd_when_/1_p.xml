<p id="Par50">As a second approach to link island vulnerability to loss of PD, we tested whether loss of 
 <italic>all</italic> islands assigned to a given vulnerability category would lead to higher ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> than at random (p_values
 <sub>all</sub>). This differs from the previous analyses which considered the 
 <italic>independent</italic> loss of islands (p_values
 <sub>ind</sub>).
