<p id="Par52">We then compared ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> when all genera found on islands belonging to a given category of vulnerability were lost to ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> when genera were distributed randomly among categories of vulnerability. In this randomization procedure, the number of genera per category of vulnerability and the number of categories of vulnerability a genus belonged to were retained. This procedure was run 1000 times and we calculated whether the frequency of the observed ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> per vulnerability category was higher than by chance (p_values
 <sub>all</sub>). This approach was similar to the one used in step 2 but here genera were randomized between categories of vulnerability instead of between islands as distinct units. To account for evolutionary distinctiveness and range-restriction, we also performed a similar analysis for ExpSR
 <italic>loss</italic> and ExpSR
 <italic>loss</italic>
 <sub>ED</sub> (Supplementary method S2). Moreover, all analyses described above were conducted on all genera occurring on islands and then only on genera restricted to islands.
