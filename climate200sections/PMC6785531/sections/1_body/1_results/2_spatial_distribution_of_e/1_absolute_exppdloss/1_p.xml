<p id="Par7">Estimates of expected loss of phylogenetic diversity at a global scale (ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic>) following local species extinctions indicated that the ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> per island was highest at low latitudes and in the eastern part of the world such as in Madagascar, Borneo, New Guinea, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Sumatra but with Cuba being one of the most notable exception (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; see Supplementary Dataset 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> for the full list of islands and their ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic>). The islands whose disappearance would cause the greatest ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> when only endemic genera were included were Madagascar, Sumatra, Tasmania, New-Caledonia, Honshu, Cuba, New Guinea, and Sri Lanka, among others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). When corrected for sampling effort, the relative ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> values changed only slightly when considering either all genera or only endemic genera (Supplementary datasets S1 and S2).
