<p id="Par10">We found contrasting results depending on the threat considered. For shifts in temperature, ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was higher than expected by chance only when all islands with low vulnerability were lost (p_value
 <sub>all</sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Regarding sea level rise and global vulnerability to climate change, p_value
 <sub>all</sub> were relatively high in both islands with moderate and very high vulnerability. As for the effect of a shift in rainfall, ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was the most significant when highly vulnerable islands were lost. Moreover, for three out of the four threats considered, the loss of genera occurring on the most vulnerable islands would cause higher ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> than expected in 60% to 80% of our randomizations. Yet, we observed that p_values
 <sub>all</sub> were poorly congruent with the phylogenetic signal of extinction probabilities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
