<p id="Par6">Over the 5,565 islands studied, the most represented category was “moderate vulnerability”, followed by low, high and very high vulnerability, respectively, for all the types of threats. In general, global vulnerability was correlated to sea level rise, shift in temperature and shift in rainfall, however, scores for these three threats had lower correlations with each other (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Islands that were most vulnerable to threats from climate change were more frequently situated at low latitudes and/or in the Southern Hemisphere, e.g. in Australia or in the Pacific Ocean, such as Kiribati and French Polynesia islands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Yet, some northern islands also had high vulnerability, especially regarding shifts in rainfall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), for example in Norway and Sweden. In total, 54, 109, 165 and 34 islands had a very high vulnerability to sea level rise, shift in temperature, shift in rainfall, and global threat from climate change, respectively (Fig.
