 <caption> Distribution of the ExpPD loss caused by the independent loss of islands when considering ( a) all monocot genera (n = 1,497) found on islands worldwide (n = 5,565); ( b) only monocot genera that are endemic (n = 96) to islands (n = 72). Red lines represent the fitted levels of expected diversity loss (cubic smoothing spline) along longitudes and latitudes. Black dashed lines represent the fitted of the number of islands (cubic smoothing spline) along longitudes and latitudes. </caption>
