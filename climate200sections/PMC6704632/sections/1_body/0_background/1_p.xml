<p id="Par4">The topic of climate change and its impact on health is increasingly present in public and academic discourse. Yet, research funding still lags [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] behind other sectors affected by climate change, e.g., agriculture or marine systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Moreover, expertise to conduct research in climate change and health is unequally distributed between the Global North and South [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is an urgent need for more professional training to stimulate engagement of climate change on a global level and to expand global engagement with and understanding of climate change and health, as well as research efforts in this topic area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To this end, massive open online courses (MOOCs) show promise for: (i) quickly disseminating general knowledge on the topic for global citizens and (ii) adapting knowledge to specific contexts, e.g. high-level policymakers or particular settings in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. MOOCs have been taken up by major universities worldwide and have been heralded for revolutionizing global education since MOOCs are “open–access online courses that allow for unlimited participation” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With more than 150 million students in education worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], MOOCs have shown great potential in their extensive global reach.
