<p id="Par27">The three MOOCs have raised awareness among global citizens in the linkage of climate change and health, as they have reached researchers from diverse backgrounds and citizens from low-resource environments that are most vulnerable to climate change effects. Astonishingly, the francophone MOOC-AFR sparked high interest (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] for more details on evaluation results of the three MOOCs) in low-resource countries to learn more about climate change to pass it on to their community, families and professional environment. Costs for development and updating of the MOOC are to be accounted for, but even low-tech MOOCs that do not incorporate expensive “Hollywood”-effects may be successful teaching and learning tools if a pedagogical strategy is in place that incorporates an activating and stimulating environment beyond teacher-centered sessions. Based on our experience, MOOCs may play a part in global capacity building, even beyond the topic of climate change and its impact on health, and are a promising tool even in low-resource contexts. MOOCs may support creating awareness of health impacts of climate change, and act as an empowering instrument, even reaching the most vulnerable citizens.
