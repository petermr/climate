<p>The root of global climate change is likely anthropogenic in nature. Rise in global temperatures coincides with the Industrial Revolution and the emission of greenhouse gases, the most prominent of which is carbon dioxide (Maxwell, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). Undoubtedly, carbon dioxide emissions are increasing (Malik, Lan, &amp; Lenzen, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>); half of all the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from 1750 to 2011 have occurred during the past 40Â years, with the largest increases in greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2010 (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Today, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from all human activities account for approximately 80% of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions within the United States. This accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere intensifies the greenhouse effect; thus, increased absorption and reflection of Earth's infrared energy emissions by a collection of greenhouse gases has led to increased surface temperatures (Anderson, Hawkins, &amp; Jones,
