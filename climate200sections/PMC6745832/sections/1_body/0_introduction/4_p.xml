<p>Notably, the effects of global climate change are not uniformly distributed among latitudes, as higher latitudes are expected to warm at an increased rate relative to the global mean (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This is evidenced by the reductions in global glacier mass and the decline in size of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Alley, Clark, Huybrechts, &amp; Joughin, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Oerlemans, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Additionally, global climate change differentially affects seasons with a greater absolute increase in temperatures during the winter relative to the summer (Hughes, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Indeed, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) records from 1970 to 2014 demonstrate a seasonal trend of winter temperatures warming twice the rate of the summer. Crucially, global climate change is not limited to increases in surface temperatures, as global climate change also encompasses alterations to the global hydrological cycle, and, consequently, global precipitation. Since 1950, precipitation has increased substantially in mid‐latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Analysis of satellite observations demonstrates a steady increase in overall precipitation and total atmospheric water, as a result of increased temperatures and the saturation of water vapor pressure (Liepert &amp; Previdi, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Wentz, Ricciardulli, Hilburn, &amp; Mears, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0135" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Furthermore, climate models predict a contrasting change in global precipitation; high latitudes, mid‐latitude wet regions, and the equatorial Pacific are expected to experience increased precipitation, whereas mid‐latitude and subtropical dry regions are expected to experience decreased precipitation (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
