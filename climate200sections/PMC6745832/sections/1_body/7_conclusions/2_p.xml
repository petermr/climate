<p>It is indisputable that the Earth's surface temperature is rising and precipitation throughout the Earth is dynamic, and the cause of these shifts is likely anthropogenic in nature. Climate change has clear direct and indirect effects on both plants and animals, and it is possible that others exist which are yet unidentified or under examined. Of relevance, climate change in combination with a stable photoperiod presents extreme organismal evolutionary pressure and when organisms are unable to adapt or flexibly adjust, the result has severe deleterious consequences for individual species reproduction and, therefore, for species survival (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35537-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Depending on the organism, its habitat, its ability to adapt, and its interactions with other species, the growing misalignment among temperature, precipitation, and photoperiod can translate into a falling out of synchrony between organisms and their native ecosystem. Moreover, not only are organisms under evolutionary pressures from abiotic factors in their environment (i.e., temperature and precipitation changes), but they are also subjected to the effects that other organisms in their environments might have due to their response and ability to adapt to these environmental changes. The ability of individuals to adapt will depend on the plasticity of the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic time measurement. Lack of plasticity in these mechanisms will likely lead to local extinctions.
