<p>The favorable effects on plant growth due to global climate change can culminate in beneficial effects on animals. This is observed in tussocks cottongrass (
 <italic>Eriophorum vaginatum</italic>) and reindeer (
 <italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic>) inhabiting Seward Peninsula in Alaska (Cebrian, Kielland, &amp; Finstad, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Here, early snowmelt advanced the time of flowering of 
 <italic>E. vaginatum</italic>, which serves as food for 
 <italic>R. tarandus</italic>, and altered its nitrogen concentrations throughout inflorescence, effectively modifying its chemistry as evidenced by enhanced digestibility of the plant. Modeling suggests that an increase in digestibility of the plant will result in a twofold rise in dry matter intake, which will translate into an increase in reindeer weight, during the critical period of late winter to early spring, during which reindeer prepare for reproduction and breed (Cebrian et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). This increased body weight would support the recovery of fat and protein loss during the winter. Moreover, the replenishing of these nutrients would allow for a rise in milk production in females (Chan‐McLeod, White, &amp; Holleman, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>), resulting in positive cascading effects by increasing healthy calf growth, survival, and reproduction of the species.
