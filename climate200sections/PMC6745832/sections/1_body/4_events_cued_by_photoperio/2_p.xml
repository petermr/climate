<p>Studies on animals have revealed how photoperiod influences key events in their life history. For example, changes in day length affect metabolism causing fluctuations in body weight and related hormones. For nocturnal Syrian hamsters (
 <italic>Mesocricetus auratus</italic>), short days (10:14) promote body weight gain, as well as white and brown adipose tissue increase, independent of pinealectomy (Bartness &amp; Wade, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>). These findings suggest that melatonin is not required for this weight gain to occur. Djungarian hamsters (
 <italic>Phodopus sungorus</italic>) also experience photoperiod‐associated weight changes. They lose 30% of body weight with a 20% decrease in food intake over winter (Steinlechner, Heldmaier, &amp; Becker, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0117" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>); however, this decrease is not detrimental, but adaptive. Their size reduction allows the species to maximize its feeding efficiency by increasing the relative food requirements without increasing its absolute food intake. These cases are examples of seemingly opposite adaptive mechanisms, mediated by photoperiodic signals, to prepare these rodents for the winter months when food is scarce, and they need to effectively preserve energy.
