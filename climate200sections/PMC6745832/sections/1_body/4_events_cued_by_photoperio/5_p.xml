<p>The effects of disrupted photoperiod due to LAN are not limited to reproduction. Numerous studies have demonstrated changes in behavior and immune function, which in the wild would likely lead to reduced fitness. For example, mice housed in dim light at night consume food at the “wrong” time of day (during the day), as well as reduce their avoidance of open field conditions, two behaviors which are maladaptive for small nocturnal prey species (Fonken et al.,

Specifically, LAN exposure suppressed antibody production in cockerels and reduced cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells in rats (Kirby &amp; Froman,

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Notably, given the pervasive nature of LAN in today's society, there will likely arise synergistic detrimental effects on individuals due to global climate change and exposure to light at night.
