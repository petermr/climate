<p>Day length also serves as a cue for successful reproduction. Optimal synchrony of tissue‐specific peripheral circadian clocks, which may be impacted by perturbed photoperiodic cycles, is also essential for successful reproduction, as food and nutrient availability is key to fitness and survival (Reiter, Tan, Korkmaz, &amp; Rosales‐Corral,
