<p>Further indirect detrimental effects on plants include the expansion of invasive alien plant species (Dukes &amp; Mooney,

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>) propose these invasive species possess particular traits which allow them to better capitalize on components of global climate change such as increases in CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations and nitrogen deposition. Indeed, Smith et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0114" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) established that the presence of elevated carbon dioxide increased above‚Äêground production and seed rain in invasive annual grass compared to several species of native annuals. Furthermore, Nagel, Huxman, Griffin, and Smith (
