<p>The adverse effects of global climate change are not limited to plants. One of the most worrisome consequences of climate change is the extinction of animal species. Although currently there is no meaningful evidence that climate change has led to species extinction, there is an abundance of evidence that demonstrates that climate change has led to population declines. This is particularly true for populations of animal species which are limited in range due to geographic constraints (i.e., high‚Äêaltitude mountainous species and Arctic/Antarctic species; Derocher, Lunn, &amp; Stirling,

 <italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) in the Western Hudson Bay relates to climate change. The authors concluded that the physical condition and natality of polar bears had significantly declined from 1981 to 1998. This decline was associated with earlier sea ice breakup as a result of warming air temperatures.
