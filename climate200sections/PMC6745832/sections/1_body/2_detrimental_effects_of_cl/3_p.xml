<p>Additionally, rising temperatures are predicted to increase plant extinction, as plants can no longer track regions of suitable climate (Corlett &amp; Westcott, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Indeed, Corlett and Westcott (
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) propose that plant species will need to move greater than one kilometer per year to keep up with climate change; this pace can only be met in extremely rare instances where plants possess the combination of characteristics including long dispersal distances and short time to maturation. The harmful effects of global climate change on plants can also occur via indirect mechanisms. Harvell et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) suggest that rising temperatures and milder winters will have detrimental effects on plant species by increasing the winter survival of plant pathogens, accelerating their development, and expanding pathogen range. Indeed, studies examining the effects of climate change on plant diseases have concluded that rising temperatures likely increase plant disease severity. This is evidenced by
