<p>Photoperiod refers to day length, which varies with latitude and seasons. It is governed by Earth's rotation around the Sun and its tilt. With this continual rotation, the hemispheres receive differing exposure to sunlight, hence creating the different seasons characterized by varying day length and temperature. Day length does not perceptibly vary across years. Hence, it is a reliable cue for animals and plants to drive their nutritional, metabolic, and reproductive behaviors, which ultimately results in regular seasonal rhythms. Although photoperiod has no direct effects on fitness, it allows prediction of environmental factors that do directly affect fitness. Over evolutionary time, there has been selection for exquisite precision in photoperiodic regulation of physiology and behavior tied to environmental conditions (Stevenson, Prendergast, &amp; Nelson, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). These photoperiod‐mediated patterns occur over various months every year in direct correlation with day length (Bartness &amp; Wade, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>; Bronson, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Chemineau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Organisms under photoperiod‐driven rhythms depend on photic cues as driving factors for behavioral and physiological events. In mammals, light enters the eyes and stimulates the retinas, activating intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that contain the photopigment, melanopsin, which responds especially to blue wavelength light. Despite their receptiveness to wavelengths of light, ipRGCs do not contribute to visual responses (Gooley, Lu, Chou, Scammell, &amp; Saper, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Hattar, Liao, Takao, Berson, &amp; Yau, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). This information is relayed to the master circadian clock in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), via the monosynaptic retinohypothalamic tract (RHT; Moore &amp; Lenn, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>; Moore, Speh, &amp; Card, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>; Ralph, Foster, Davis, &amp; Menaker, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>; Sadun, Schaechter, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>; Stephan &amp; Zucker,

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">1972a</xref>). Subsequently, the SCN communicates with secondary oscillators in the brain, such as the pineal gland, pituitary gland, and other brain regions, which in turn, relay the photoperiodic signal to the rest of the body modulating sleep, endocrine responses (Moore &amp; Eichler, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>; Moore &amp; Lenn, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>), patterns of daily locomotor activity (Stephan &amp; Zucker, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">1972b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">1972a</xref>), and core body temperature (Scheer, Pirovano, Someren, &amp; Buijs, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) among others. Hence, it follows that circadian rhythms can be tempered by altering biological light conditions. Importantly, having entrained circadian rhythms is critical for endogenous assessment of day length.
