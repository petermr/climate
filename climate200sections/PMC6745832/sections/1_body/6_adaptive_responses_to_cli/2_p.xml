<p>As previously discussed, asynchrony between temperature‐defined seasons and circannual events as a result of global climate change can have a profound impact on species fitness and survival. Therefore, some species have developed adaptive responses to attempt to maintain synchrony. These adaptive responses include both phenotypic plasticity and heritable genetic changes. As previously discussed, great tits (

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Notably, great tits demonstrate individual plasticity in reproduction timing (Nussey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). As a result, natural selection has occurred to favor highly plastic individuals by maintaining the greatest lifetime breeding success. Therefore, continued selection based on plasticity of egg‐laying time may alleviate this mismatch between reproductive timing and food availability.
