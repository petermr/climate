<p>Additional examples of adaptive responses to maintain synchrony between reproductive timing and food availability include Canadian red squirrels (
 <italic>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</italic>) advancing their reproduction time to match with earlier spruce cone production, as well as multiple bird species in the United Kingdom advancing their time of egg laying to synchronize with earlier onset of spring (Crick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Réale, Berteaux, McAdam, &amp; Boutin, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Further adaptations in behavior have been reported that help to synchronize winter plumage mismatch in species of winter birds. For instance, rock ptarmigans (
 <italic>L. muta</italic>) in Canada dirty themselves when mismatched with snowless habitats, and Scandinavian willow ptarmigans (
 <italic>Lagopus lagopus</italic>) reportedly feed in areas that match their plumage, even when feeding grounds have inferior nutrients (Montgomerie, Lyon, &amp; Holder, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Steen, Erikstad, &amp; Høidal, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). Notably, not all adaptations to maintain synchrony between temperatures, defined seasons and circannual events have occurred due to plastic phenotypes. Studies of pitcher‐plant mosquitos (
 <italic>Wyeomyia smithii)</italic> have demonstrated alterations in genetically controlled photoperiodic cues to enter winter diapause (Bradshaw &amp; Holzapfel, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Specifically, over the past 30 years northern populations of the pitcher‐plant mosquitos have evolved a shorter critical photoperiod to initiate winter diapause. Additionally, studies have demonstrated genetic selection for reproductive photoresponsiveness in deer mice (
 <italic>Peromyscus maniculatus</italic>; Desjardins, Bronson, &amp; Blank, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>).
