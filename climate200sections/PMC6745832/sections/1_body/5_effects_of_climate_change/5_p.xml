<p>Yet another example of how the increasingly warming climate has affected animals is the Greenland caribou (
 <italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic>). Caribou are seasonal migratory animals which use day length as a cue for migration to ranges that favor calf rearing due to peak readiness of trophic resources. However, plant growth is cued by temperature, and as a result of warming over the years, now occurs in advance of caribou migration; thus, as in previous examples, creating a misalignment between offspring production, rearing, and peak resource availability (Post &amp; Forchhammer, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The result of this disparity has been an overall reduction in progeny production with an increase in progeny mortality. A similar mismatch between migration and food source availability due to climate change has been observed in the pied flycatchers of Western Europe (Both, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Outside of breeding season, pied flycatchers (
 <italic>Ficedula hypoleuca</italic>) spend the year in Africa. Pied flycatchers use photoperiodic cues to prepare for and commence migration (Gwinner, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>), thus trying to predict the initiation of spring at their breeding grounds in Western Europe. However, climate change has led to an advancement in the development and subsequent availability of caterpillars without a concurrent advancement in pied flycatchers' migration from Africa. This culminates in pied flycatcher chicks being fed a more varied and less nutrient‚Äêrich diet, slowing their growth and reducing the number of birds that survive and return as breeders.
