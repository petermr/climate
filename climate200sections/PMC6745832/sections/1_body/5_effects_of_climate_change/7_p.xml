<p>Notably, most studies have examined the effects of climate change and a stable photoperiod on species inhabiting temperate and polar regions. Few studies have examined the effects of climate change, particularly alterations in photoperiod and precipitation, in subtropical and tropical species that time reproductive events during the rainy season (Bronson,

Considering all things, it is undeniable that the ecological disruption left in the wake of global climate change can have a profound impact on species fitness and, ultimately, survival.
