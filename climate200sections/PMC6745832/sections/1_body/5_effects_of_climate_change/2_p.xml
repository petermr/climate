<p>Despite the impact on temperature and precipitation, global climate change has no effect on day length, a key 
 <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> (time giver) used by both plants and animals to time seasonal transitions and growing periods (Andrews &amp; Belknap, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Hence, the mismatch between temperature and day length cues creates an additional confounding dimension for organismal development, reproduction, and survival. This leads to potential detrimental effects on individuals as seasonality and annual events are modulated by both temperature and photoperiod; therefore, the growing disparity between temperature and photoperiod misaligns this synchrony that defines seasons and cyclic events. Examples of these are as follows: reproduction not aligned with nutrient availability (Visser &amp; Both,

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>), disrupted prey–predator and plant–pollinator interactions, and other symbiotic relationships (Donnelly et al.,
