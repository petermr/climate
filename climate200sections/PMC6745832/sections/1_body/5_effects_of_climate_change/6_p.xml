<p>Further examples of climate‐induced asynchrony between seasons and circannual events include alterations in predator–prey interactions. Specifically, a recent decline in snowshoe hare (
 <italic>Lepus americanus</italic>) populations has been attributed to coat color mismatch (Mills et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Pedersen, Odden, &amp; Pedersen, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Snowshoe hares use photoperiod cues to regulate and initiate molting via melatonin and prolactin signaling (Zimova et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, increasing temperatures, and thus reductions in snow cover, has resulted in a disparity between snowshoe hare coat color and dark snowless habitats. Unfortunately, the snowshoe hare has limited plasticity in molting time, thus leading to a 7% decline in survival rates due to increased visibility to predators and culminating in population declines (Zimova et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Zimova, Mills, Lukacs, &amp; Mitchell, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Zimova, Mills, &amp; Nowak, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0140" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Similar detrimental disparities between coat color and the environment due to climate change have been reported in the Alpine rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), the Arctic fox (
 <italic>Vulpes lagopus</italic>), and snow leopards (
 <italic>Panthera uncia</italic>) and are presumed to occur in other animals such as lemmings (
 <italic>Dicrostonyx</italic>), weasels (
 <italic>Mustela)</italic>, and Arctic wolf (
 <italic>Canis lupus</italic>; Beltran, Burns, &amp; Breed,
