<p id="p0095">It is possible to simulate the plant-atmosphere interaction, fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation, pollutant emissions, and complex structures using the ENVI-met software suite. The simulated area was designed using a high spatial resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1), having 1.84 meters of spatial resolution on multispectral bands (
