<p id="p0160">The accuracy of software performance was analyzed using the following quantitative metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which expresses the difference between values predicted by the model and values actually observed from the environment being modelled; Mean absolute deviation (MAD), which expresses the accuracy in the same unit as the original data, helping us to conceptualize the amount of error, and Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), which expresses the accuracy as a percentage of the error.</p>
