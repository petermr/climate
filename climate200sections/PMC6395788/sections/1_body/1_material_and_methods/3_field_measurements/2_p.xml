 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c and d). To prevent sensor interferences from the leaves, meteorological stations were installed in a coffee plant place (we cut off one coffee tree), and the surroundings of the stations were cleaned monthly. All sensors were located at the standard height of 1.60 m, as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, the anemometers were installed at the height of coffee canopy, as proposed by

 <sup>2</sup>), Temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and wind speed (m/s) were measured every hour from April to November 2009. The sensors of all stations were calibrated before installation and gauged regularly during the experiments.
