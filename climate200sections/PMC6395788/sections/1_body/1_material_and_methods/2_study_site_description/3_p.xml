 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala</italic>) to the south (SH1); (ii) coffee with Leucena (
 <italic>Leucaena leucocephala)</italic> to the north, and gliricidia (
 <italic>Gliricidia sepium)</italic> to the south (SH2); (iii) coffee planted with Macadamia nuts (SH3), and (iv) full sun system (control). Shaded tree dimensions are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The cultivation orientation was northeast. SH1 and SH2 were arranged sequentially, in a homogeneous slope with 20° inclination. SH3 presented the same characteristics but with 30° inclination. The neighborhood of experimental area was also occupied by coffee fields.
