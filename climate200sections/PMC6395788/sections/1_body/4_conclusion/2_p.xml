<p id="p0320">The present study investigated how meteorological variables behave in low levels of shade in coffee agrosystems, and the possibility of using an accessible microclimate simulator software (Envi-met) to simulate shaded-grown coffee systems. We also addressed the possibility of conducting coffee in low levels of shade avoiding the productivity losses and acting as an adaptive management to climate change scenarios in the South of Minas Gerais.</p>
