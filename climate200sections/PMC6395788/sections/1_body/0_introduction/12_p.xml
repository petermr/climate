<p id="p0060">In this study, we investigated: (i) the pattern of the meteorological variables (such as temperature, radiation, and wind speed) in different coffee shading schemes (up to 30% of shading); (ii) the performance of Envi-met software as a simulator of shaded-grown coffee microclimate; and (iii) if the shade schemes tested may be an adaptation technique to future climate scenarios in the south of Minas Gerais.</p>
