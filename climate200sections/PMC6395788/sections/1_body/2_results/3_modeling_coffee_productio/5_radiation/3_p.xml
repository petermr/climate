<p id="p0235">All simulated meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity and radiation) presented the same curve pattern as experimental measured data (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 6</xref>), suggesting that the model presents similar trends for these variables. Thus, ENVI-met simulated well the radiation, temperature, and the humidity cycle in all coffee treatment conditions considered in this study.
