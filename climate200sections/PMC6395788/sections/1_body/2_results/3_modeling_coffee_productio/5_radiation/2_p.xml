<p id="p0230">For radiation values, full sun and SH1 presented the best agreement index and lowest variance, errors, and percentage of errors between simulated and real data, followed by SH3, and SH2. The most expressive errors occurred after sunrise and at sunset. When radiation increases (6 am) the model overestimates the values tending to increase the radiation faster than the reality. The error increases until 7 am, and after that, the residual error decreases. At the end of the day, when the sun sets, the model also overestimates the radiation, decreasing the error when the experimental radiation equals zero.</p>
