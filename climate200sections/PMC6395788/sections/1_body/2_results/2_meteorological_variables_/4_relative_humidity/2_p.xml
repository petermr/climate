<p id="p0175">As expected, relative humidity behavior varied inversely to temperature behavior. The biggest difference between relative humidity averages occurred in the driest period of the year, mainly in August. The relative humidity was higher in SH3 (75.5%) than in the other treatments. SH1, SH2, and full sun varied between 73.8 and 74.5% and did not differ statistically. In rainy season, we had not much difference between treatments. In the hourly analyses, the largest variation occurred in the treatment with more shade (SH3), following the temperature pattern.</p>
