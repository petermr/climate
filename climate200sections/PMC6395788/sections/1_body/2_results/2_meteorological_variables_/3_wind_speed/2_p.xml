<p id="p0170">The wind speed was the meteorological variable that presented higher difference between the treatments. Statistical differences between mean values of wind speed were significant by the t test, and all treatments differed statistically (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Compared to the control (full sun), SH1 had 21.7% of reduction in wind speed, SH2 had 65.2% reduction, and SH3 had the wind speed almost totally attenuated, with 99.3% of reduction. The result suggests that in these schemes, as shading increases, wind speed decreases. In SH2 and SH3 systems, the shading functioned even as a “windbreak”.
