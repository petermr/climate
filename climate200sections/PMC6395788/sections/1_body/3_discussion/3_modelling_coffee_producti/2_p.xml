<p id="p0290">The data available for model parameterization of coffee agroforestry systems is limited (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Van Oijen etÂ al., 2010a</xref>). Understanding how meteorological variables work in shaded-grown system is relevant to improve coffee agrosystem management. The objective of modelling managed ecosystems is to understand how the process works, and how the elements interact with each other, trying to predict their behavior to anticipate answers and minimize gaps in our knowledge.
