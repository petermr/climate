<p id="p0310">Eventually, for the shaded-grown schemes considered here, the results suggest that Envi-met is a competent microclimate simulator of coffee production systems. The “d” Willmott agreement index ranged from 0.80 to 0.98 demonstrating that the model reproduces radiation, temperature, and the humidity cycle in all coffee treatments considered in this study. The results suggest that Envi-met model reproduces the main characteristics of meteorological variable patterns measured in the field. Therefore, the modeling approach proposed in here is indicated to be used for other coffee production areas, requiring the local adjustment of parameters and inputs, such as soil, geographical coordinates, trees attributes (LAI, high, form, etc), and local meteorological data. An option like that is particularly important, as the customer may choose different options of trees to shade the coffee plants and test them in the software.</p>
