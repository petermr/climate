<p id="p0255">Although wind speed and air humidity presented significant reduction in shaded treatments, especially SH3, comparing to full sun system, the light reduction did not decrease the temperature significantly, as observed in previous studies, where temperature reduction was superior to 2 °C (

 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, presented the simulation of shade behavior during the day (9 h, 12 h, 15 h, and 17 h – local hour) for all the treatments, for two dates: 21
 <sup>st</sup> of June (winter solstice), and 23
 <sup>rd</sup> of September (vernal – Spring-equinox). We observed that at 12 h and 15 h, coffee systems SH1 and SH2 did not receive shade of the trees, having only a self-shadowing of coffee trees, making it difficult to attenuate the temperature.
