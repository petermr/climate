<p id="p0270">Analyzing monthly data and still regarding temperature reduction, in the driest period of the year (June to September), which is winter time in the Brazilian Southeast, temperatures reduced more than in wet and hot periods (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Camargo, 1985</xref>), and temperature reduction is important in this time of the year. In monthly average, the most significant temperature reduction occurred in August (0.63 °C for SH3, 0.4 °C for SH2, and 0.2 °C for SH1 compared to full sun system), and the blossoming period occured in the end of September and October. In this context, it is important to study the shade scheme before implementing it, preferably in an interdisciplinary scope. To implement efficient management, it is essential to study current and future climate projections, coffee flowering time, orientation (scheme) of cultivation in the field, mathematical modelling, and local (producers) acceptance to combine the balance between adaptation and production.
