<p>Initially, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to verify the influence of seasonal temperatures during the bridges’ construction. The analysis for the projected temperatures in 2100 (long-term analysis), under the higher forcing climate scenario RCP 8.5 shows that the interaction equation value (IEV) exceeds one for 100% of the SSSG bridges in the U.S., when subjected to the most severe Scenario 1 (assumption of bridges being built during the winter). When subjected to Scenario 2 (spring), the IEV exceeds one for 97% of the bridges. For Scenario 3 (summer), the IEV exceeds one for 83%. Finally, for Scenario 4 (fall), the IEV of one is exceeded for 95% of the bridges analyzed. This is presented in the histograms of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Those percentages indicate the amount of bridges in which the demand-to-capacity ratio would be beyond the structural design limits, if no intervention is made. The IEVs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g005">Fig 5</xref> are based on the assumption that the accumulated debris between the joints comprises of a mix of gravel and sand. These values are, therefore, expected to change if different material is used in the analysis as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In addition, the adoption of different RCP’s (2.6 and 6.0) results in slightly smaller values, however following the same presented trend. The pinned case shown in the table reflects a severe condition where the girders are completely restricted from expansion. The severity of the violation of the interaction equation is reduced if a calibrated equation is utilized as shown in Figure I in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223307.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. The modified/calibrated equation is based on a recent study in which composite sections were tested under combined axial compression and bending moment [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this case the analysis for the projected temperatures in 2100 shows that the IEV for 63% of the SSSG bridges in the U.S. exceed one for the most severe Scenario 1 (assumption of bridges being built during the winter), followed by 25%, 0.4% and 19% for Scenario 2 (spring), Scenario 3 (summer) and Scenario 4 (fall), respectively. Thus, the hypothesis of bridge construction during winter or summer can be used to represent conservative or extreme scenarios, while the hypothesis of construction during the spring or fall is appropriate for a more general and intermediate analysis.
