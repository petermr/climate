<p>A regional analysis is carried out in order to assess the evolution of the average of interaction equation value over the years for U.S. bridges per climate region, as showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g007">Fig 7</xref>. This analysis considers the construction during the fall and compares the effect of the three different climate scenarios RCP 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5. Such analysis highlights the progressive increase of the undesirable thermal demand imposed on the bridges over the years when there is insufficient maintenance. The most critical regions, regardless the RCP, are the Northern Rockies &amp; Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest, while the less susceptible regions are the Southeast and Northeast. One should note that even considering different seasonal construction temperatures, the results are consistent as shown in Figure J in
