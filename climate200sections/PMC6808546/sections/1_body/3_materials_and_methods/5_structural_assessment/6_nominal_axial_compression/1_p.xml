<p>The cross-sectional area of the concrete slab and the steel girder, and their respective resistances, compressive strength of the concrete– 0.85 f′
 <sub>c</sub> (MPa) and yield stress of the steel–F
 <sub>y</sub> (MPa), are considered for the contribution to the axial compressive strength of the composite P
 <sub>n</sub>.
