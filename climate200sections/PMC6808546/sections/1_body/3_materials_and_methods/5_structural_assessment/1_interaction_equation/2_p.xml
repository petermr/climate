<p>The interaction equation accounts for the demand-to-capacity ratio under axial loading and bending moment as given by Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0223307.e002">2</xref>) and is a key design parameter for the main load carrying elements. As such, to ensure adequate structural performance of the bridge girders, this ratio should not exceed unity. Otherwise, the main girders will exceed their load carrying capacity. 
 <italic>It is critical to note that historically bridge girders are only evaluated for their moment capacity without the inclusion of the effect of the axial load because it is assumed that the expansion joints will always be functional</italic>. 
 <italic>In the case of clogged joints</italic>, 
 <italic>it is imperative to evaluate the bridge girders against their ability to not only carry bending moment but also the axial load as it interacts with the bending moment</italic>. In this study, the bridges are analyzed under regular service conditions [
