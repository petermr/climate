In addition, considering the evolution of the mechanical properties of the structural steel for bridges, the inventory is divided into three groups, in order to differentiate the steel strength: bridges built before 1901 with yield strength of 26 ksi, from 1901 to 1965 with yield strength of 36 ksi, and 1966 to 2017 with yield strength of 50 ksi [
