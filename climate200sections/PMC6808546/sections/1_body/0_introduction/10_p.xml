<p>The structural performance of the SSSG bridges is assessed in terms of the interaction equation, which has long been recognized as design limit state and allows for the quantification of the demand-to-capacity ratio [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is critical to emphasize that this interaction equation, defining the ultimate limit state, is used for structural elements subjected to simultaneous action of bending moments and axial loads. 
 <italic>Bridge girders are only designed for bending moments</italic>. 
 <italic>However</italic>, 
 <italic>under the condition of clogged joints</italic>, 
 <italic>the girders would be subjected to bending moments (due to dead and traffic load) concomitantly with thermal axial load (due to expansion restriction)</italic>. In design codes and guidelines, adequate structural performance and capacity assessment of any element subjected to axial and flexure load combined is ensured by limiting the demand-to-capacity ratio to a maximum value of unity; otherwise, the girder reaches its ultimate load carrying capacity. 
 <italic>The ramifications of the interaction equation exceeding a value of unity will depend on the level of exceedance</italic>. 
 <italic>This could include substantial deformations in the bridge girders</italic>, 
 <italic>slab concrete crushing (in case of composite sections)</italic>, 
 <italic>and subsequent failures in other main load-carrying elements and secondary elements</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>In other words</italic>, 
 <italic>exceeding a value of unity for this equation will render the bridge as failed and immediate actions would have to be taken since it is no longer a serviceability issue but rather an ultimate limit state one</italic>. We note that other issues pertaining to the influence of elevated temperature on durability and potentially the strength of the concrete might be relevant. For example, in a recent study it was shown that environmental temperature, CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, and a certain range of relative humidity play an important role in the concrete carbonation rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which could be an issue for the concrete decks of the SSSG bridges. However, it was found that even in extreme natural high temperature, the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength is not affected significantly [
