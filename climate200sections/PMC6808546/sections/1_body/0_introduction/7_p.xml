<p>Girder-type bridges are highlighted not only by their vast number compared to the other types of bridge design, but also by the fact that more than 50% of all deficient bridges in the U.S. are girder type, with the majority of them being SSSG [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223307.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The total number of SSSG bridges in the U.S. is 97,393 [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the average age of this kind of bridge is 50 years old, surpassing the national average bridge age of 45 years (see
