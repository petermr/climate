<p>To further explore our main proposition, that perceiving Irma would increase willingness to pay higher taxes, we tested if the relationship between increased negative emotions and increased willingness to pay higher taxes was mediated by change in personal normative belief. Using the software 
 <italic>Process</italic> 2018 in 
 <italic>SPSS</italic> we ran a mediator analysis (Model 1). We entered change in personal normative belief as a mediator in the path between change in negative emotions and change in willingness to pay higher taxes. Results showed a significant model [
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>(3,103)</sub> = 3.06, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.08]. The model revealed a significant direct effect of emotions on willingness to pay higher taxes (β = 0.21, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 2.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01,0.40]). However, neither the effect of personal normative belief (β = 0.19, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1.24, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22, 95% CI [−0.12,0.50]), nor the interaction term (β = 0.06, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0.35, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.72, 95% CI [−0.26,0.37]) were significant.
