<p>Some studies do however show that experiencing extreme weather events do not increase environmental concern (e.g., Whitmarsh, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). A recent meta-analysis found that self-reported experiences with extreme weather only had a small positive effect on belief in climate change, while experiencing local weather change had a medium sized effect (Hornsey et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These findings may be interpreted as suggesting that extreme weather events increase attention to climate change under certain conditions; specifically, when extreme weather events are experienced as abnormal local temperatures (local warming), when extreme weather are temporarily proximal, or when extreme weather events are associated with financial damages (Sicso et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
