 <p>Climate change is primarily driven by human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and may therefore be mitigated by changes to human behavior (Clayton et al., 
  <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; IPCC, 
  <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Despite efforts to raise awareness and concern about climate change, GHG emissions continue to rise (IPCC, 
  <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Climate change seems to be at odds with the immediate, present threats to which humans are adapted to cope (Gifford et al., 
  <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Schultz, 
  <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; van Vugt et al., 
  <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In contrast to immediate dangers, climate change is typically abstract, large scale, slow and often unrelated to the welfare of our daily lives (e.g., Ornstein and Ehrlich, 
  <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Gifford, 
  <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). But there are moments when the consequences of climate change are readily apparent, such as extreme weather events. In the current paper, we examine the impact of personal experience with an extreme weather event, and the impact of this experience on beliefs about climate change, and intentions to take actions that can help prepare for and mitigate the consequences of climate change.
