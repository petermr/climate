<p id="Par14">The climate projections showed a shift of the current suitability range for the species towards the northern and eastern regions, characterized by higher altitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Following the RCP 2.6 and 4.5 predictions, the area of suitability will increase to the north and to higher elevations through 2070, while RCPs 6.0 and 8.5 show increases by 2050 but marked decreases by 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The two latter RCPs are clearly negative for the habitat suitability of
