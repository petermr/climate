<p id="Par12">The results of our SDMs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) showed a marked increase of potential suitable range for 
 <italic>Karsenia koreana</italic> in respect to that described by previous studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. The IUCN range did not include the areas with high suitability in the northwestern and southern regions of the country. The potential distribution resulting from our models covered a large part of western Korea, situated between ca. 100 and 700 meters above sea level west of the Baekdudaegan Mountain Range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There is also a disjunct area of high suitability located to the northeast in the Pyeongchang area, which matches with reports of the species in that region
