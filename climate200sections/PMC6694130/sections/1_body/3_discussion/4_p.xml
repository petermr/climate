<p id="Par20">The jackknife analysis indicates that precipitation is likely a limiting environmental factor in the range of 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic>, and that the species requires sufficient precipitation in the dry winter months to persist. Projections for all RCPs indicate that future habitats for 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> will be fragmented. In all cases, the suitable range for the species will shift, in which case the species may require translocation to persist. With continued development of natural areas by humans, translocation to more remote areas that already have protected status may be necessary. For instance, Baekdudaegan Mountains Reserve is currently outside the suitable range for 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic>, but projections indicate the species may be able to inhabit areas in the reserve in the future. Since the goal of this modelling was to determine effects of climate change on 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic>, this model leaves out other potentially important environmental factors, such as greenness and wetness. These factors will likely change along with the climate, and therefore, current maps of these factors could not be used in projections for this study.
