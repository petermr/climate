<p id="Par17">Our results highlight a significantly larger habitat suitable for 
 <italic>Karsenia koreana</italic> than is the current known distribution of the species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. The fact that the model matches with the known presence in counties
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup> and five other data points
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>
 </sup>. highlights the accuracy of our prediction. Discrepancies are not impossible as precise spatial modelling from a low number of samples can result in large variations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>
 </sup>. The range of the species may be restricted by additional factors that could not be included in the model, such as competition. As an example, within plethodontid salamander, spatial distributions can be influenced by interference competition to complete competitive exclusion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>
 </sup>. Second, salamanders may have been extirpated from some parts of the range, for instance during the Korean War when logging was intensive. However, Plethodontids are lungless ectotherms, and it appears that their activity and geographic distribution is predominantly controlled by climate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, salamanders may exist in areas where they have not been discovered yet, which introduces a bias in the ecological preferences of the species, and on the SDM as a result. Additional field surveys are required to clearly record the occurrence of the species, and further observations would improve the precision of habitat suitability models.
