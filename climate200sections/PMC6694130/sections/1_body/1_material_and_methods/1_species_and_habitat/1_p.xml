<p id="Par6">Very little is known about 
 <italic>Karsenia koreana</italic>. Its breeding behaviour was observed for the first time in 2016, but it still lacks any formal description in the wild
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. The species is not as stringently bound to the aquatic environment as other amphibians due to the absence of a larval stage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>, and to unusual breeding behaviour
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Like most plethodontids, 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> breeds and lays eggs on land and where they develop directly into adults without a larval stage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
