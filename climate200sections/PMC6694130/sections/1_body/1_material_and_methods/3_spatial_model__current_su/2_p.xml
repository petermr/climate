<p id="Par10">To determine the current suitability range for 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic>, Maxent was run with 82 occurrences, reduced from 139 by removing duplicate presence records within 1 km

 </sup>, with a threshold at 10-percentile training presence. The averages of all runs were used as final models, and jackknife analysis was used to determine the factors contributing the greatest amount to habitat suitability. The final model was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>) and percent of occurrences within the 10-percentile training presence area. Additionally, we verified the accuracy of our prediction by comparing predicted suitable areas with the speciesâ€™ reported distribution
