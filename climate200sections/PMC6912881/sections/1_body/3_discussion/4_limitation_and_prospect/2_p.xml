<p>Based on comprehensive field investigation data and the ensemble SDM method, we revealed the possible change in potential distribution of the dominant woody plant species in Junggar Basin. However, we did not take into account some other important factors, besides climatic and topographical ones, in the model calibration. For example, human activities like water overexploitation can significantly affect the streamflow of a waterbody and, consequently, the living conditions of the riparian

 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Therefore, assuming that the waterbody would remain the same in the future may lead to an overly optimistic estimation of the habitat change of
