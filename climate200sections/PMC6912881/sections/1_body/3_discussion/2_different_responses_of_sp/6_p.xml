<p>The variable importance evaluation showed that climatic variables have only marginal influence on the distribution of 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic>. This result corresponds to our field observation and other research, for 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> forest is intrazonal vegetation in the Junggar Basin and, basically, only distributed along the desert river bank (Huang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). The water source of the 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> forest originates mainly from deep subsoil water and groundwater, which is commonly recharged by a river streamflow and flood (Si, Feng, Cao, Yu, &amp; Zhao, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Therefore, 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> is less susceptible to climatic variation but more susceptible to distance from a waterbody (Aishan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In this context, as we assumed the distance to waterbody remains stationary in the future, the potential distribution of 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> is unlikely to experience a massive transformation, which was also implied in our prediction result.
