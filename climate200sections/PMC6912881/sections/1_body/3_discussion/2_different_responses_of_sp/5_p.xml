<p>Contrary to 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> seems to be a “winner” under future climate scenarios, with its suitable habitat expanding by 1.87%–67.6% in the 2050s and −9.94% to 86.54% in the 2070s. The expansion may be explained by the promotion of a higher temperature and precipitation amount to the germination and growth of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic>. Previous studies have found that low temperatures can significantly delay the onset of germination of 
 <italic>Calligonum</italic> species (Ren, Jin, &amp; Ling, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The low capacity of 
 <italic>Calligonum</italic> species to germinate at a lower temperature is consistent with their more frequent occurrences in sandy regions with high soil temperatures in summer (Eziz, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> has a quite different root morphology and water use strategy from 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>. The root system of 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> could penetrate up to 10 m below the soil surface and reach the groundwater, which ensures its survival during severe drought stress and makes it less sensitive to the change of precipitation (Xu &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In contrast, 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> has less developed taproots (about 3 m deep) but more advanced lateral roots (about 10–20 m in a horizontal direction; Li, Lei, Zhao, Xu, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), making it depend more on surface water and more susceptible to precipitation change than 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Simulated precipitation change experiments also found that the seedlings of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> need more water to survive than other desert species and prefer a water supply condition of more than 88 mm of precipitation (Li &amp; Zhao, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Considering the two factors mentioned above, we could infer that the current distribution of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> may be mainly limited by low temperature and precipitation, which is also consistent with our results of the variable importance evaluation. The future increase of temperature and precipitation in this region is, hence, likely to relieve this limitation and trigger the expansion of its potential distribution. Our prediction is consistent with that of Hamit, Abdushalih, Xu, and Jiesisi (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and Liu, Feng, and Guan (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) in suggesting the potential expansion of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> in other regions. Nevertheless, in the RCP2.6 scenario of the 2070s, a range contraction of 9.94% was predicted for 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic>. This result is in line with the findings of Zhang (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), who predicted the suitable areas of 10 plant species in the arid region of northwestern China are expected to shrink under a low‐emission scenario but expand under a higher‐emission scenario. The possible explanation is that the higher evaporation rate resulting from increased temperature may neutralize the effects of a precipitation increase under a low‐emission scenario, causing the loss of suitable habitat.
