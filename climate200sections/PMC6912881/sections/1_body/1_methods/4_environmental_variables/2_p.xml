<p>We used 19 bioclimatic variables derived from the monthly temperature and precipitation values, which represent annual trends, seasonality, and extreme or limiting environmental factors (Fick &amp; Hijmans, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Current climate values are the average for the years 1970–2000. To predict future distributions of the four species in Junggar Basin, we also used projected future climate in the medium (2050s, mean of 2030–2060) and long term (2070s, mean of 2060–2080). Here, we considered three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), including an optimistic (RCP2.6), a moderate (RCP4.5), and a pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5) proposed by IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Cubasch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As large variability exists in the projected future climate by different general circulation models (GCMs; Goberville, Beaugrand, Hautekeete, Piquot, &amp; Luczak, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), we selected the projections from seven GCMs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), including BCC‐CSM1‐1 (Beijing Climate Center, China), CCSM4 (National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA), GISS‐E2‐R (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, USA), HadGEM2‐ES (Met Office Hadley Centre, UK), IPSL‐CM5A‐LR (Institut Pierre‐Simon Laplace, France), MRI‐CGCM3 (Meteorological Research Institute, Japan), and NorESM1‐M (Norwegian Climate Centre, Norway). All the raster maps of current and future bioclimatic variables at 30‐s resolution were downloaded from the WorldClim database (
