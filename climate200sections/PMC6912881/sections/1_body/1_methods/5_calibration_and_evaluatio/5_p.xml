<p>We further evaluated the relative importance of different climatic variables in shaping the distribution of each species using the biomod2 package (Gama, Crespo, Dolbeth, &amp; Anastacio, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The importance of a variable was calculated as 1 minus the correlation coefficient between the outputs of two models in which the original and shuffled values of the focal variable were used, respectively. The calculation of the importance of a given variable was repeated three times, and the final importance value of this variable was calculated as the mean of the three outputs. High importance values suggest that the shuffle of the focal variable could significantly change model outputs; hence, the focal variable has strong influence on the model.
