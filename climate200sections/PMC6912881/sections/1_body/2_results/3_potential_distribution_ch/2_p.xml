<p>The four species differed in the extent or direction of predicted range change among the future climate scenarios and periods (Figures

 <italic>Haloxylon ammodendron</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> were predicted to suffer from potential range contraction in all future climate scenarios and periods, and the contraction increased with the climate scenario severity. Specifically, 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> was mainly threatened in the western part of its current distribution range, while the eastern part was likely to be relatively stationary in the future (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The potential distribution of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> exhibited an obvious northward retreat. The southern part of its current distribution range was expected to contract extensively, and suitable habitats were likely to remain only in the mountainous regions of northeastern Junggar Basin under climate scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In contrast, suitable habitats of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> were expected to expand in moderate and pessimistic climate scenarios. In RCP2.6, both species exhibited minor contraction except for 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> in the 2050s, where slight expansion was predicted. The range change of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> mainly occurred in the margin of the current distribution range with slight contraction in the RCP2.6 scenario and considerable expansion in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The range change of 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> was less significant compared to the other species and mainly occurred in the northern part of its current distribution (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Generally, the dynamics of range change identified in the medium term (2050s) were reinforced in the long term (2070s).
