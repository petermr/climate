   <title>ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY ESTIMATION</title>
   <p>Kirtland's Warbler (
    <italic>Setophaga kirtlandii</italic>) is a breeding grounds habitat specialist, restricted to large stands of young, dense jack pine (
    <italic>Pinus banksiana</italic>) in glacial outwash plains containing well‐drained sandy soils (Probst, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>; Probst et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Ecologically, young jack pine trees provide low hanging branches that Kirtland's Warblers use for concealment of their ground nests, and well‐drained sandy soils reduce the probability that nests will become inundated with water during heavy rainfall events (Mayfield, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">1960</xref>; Probst, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Males establish breeding territories in jack pine‐dominated patches that are typically larger than 32 ha, with tree densities greater than 2000 stems per ha, and trees ca. 5–23 years old (Probst, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>; Probst &amp; Weinrich, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>; Walkinshaw, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>). Dense jack pine stands were historically generated naturally through large wildfires with ca. 60 year return intervals (Cleland et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Mayfield, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>), but due to broad‐scale fire suppression, an extensive network of jack pine plantations is currently used to maintain large amounts of suitable habitat on the landscape (Donner et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Probst &amp; Weinrich, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>).
   </p>
   <p>To estimate annual variation in quality of breeding habitat, we identified suitable jack pine stands using habitat management program records that included stand year‐of‐origin and habitat regeneration‐type (i.e., clear‐cut and natural regeneration, plantation, wildfire). The habitat regeneration types represent a gradient of tree densities, with natural regeneration stands typically having low tree densities (&lt;2,200 trees/ha), and plantation/wildfire stands typically having high tree densities (2,500 to &gt;7,500 trees/ha; Probst &amp; Weinrich, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Previous studies using stand history data defined Kirtland's Warbler habitat suitability based on stand age (Donner, Ribic, &amp; Probst, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, jack pine growth rates are known to differ latitudinally and longitudinally due to variations in temperature, precipitation, and soil types (e.g., Kashian, Barnes, &amp; Walker, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Thus, we translated known stand ages across the study area to estimated stand heights to more accurately capture patch‐specific habitat suitability over time. The stands were classified as nonhabitat (0), low (1)‐, moderate (2)‐, or high (3)‐quality habitat each year based on regeneration‐type and estimated stand height (see [Brown et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>] for additional details).
   </p>
   <p>To allow both breeding grounds habitat suitability and wintering grounds precipitation to predict productivity, our equation included two predictive components. The first component estimated baseline productivity based on breeding grounds habitat quality. The intercept of this equation (i.e., 1.1114) represented the baseline number of male fledglings produced per male each year. We then multiplied the intercept by the pairing success estimates for low/moderate suitability and high suitability breeding habitat, modified to account for polygyny in high‐quality habitat (Bocetti, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Probst &amp; Hayes, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>; Rockwell, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We used 0.85 for habitat suitability values ≤2 based on the estimate of Probst (
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). We used 0.97 for habitat suitability value = 3 based on Rockwell (
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). This resulted in baseline productivity values of 0.9447 and 1.0781 for birds occupying low/moderate‐quality and high‐quality habitat, respectively. We used a regression equation to estimate baseline productivity values from mean habitat quality: Baseline productivity = 0.678 + (0.1334 × [Habitat Quality]). We did not model nest failure as a function of habitat quality because nest parasitism rates are currently &lt; 1% (Rockwell, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), and probability of nest loss does not appear to differ based on habitat quality or stand age (Bocetti, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>).
   </p>
   <p>For the second component of the equation, we used the slope of the wintering grounds precipitation–productivity equation to estimate the number of new males produced above the baseline per cm of precipitation: Additional productivity = 0.168 x [precipitation (cm)]. Combining the influence of breeding and wintering grounds habitat quality on annual productivity: Productivity = (0.678 + (0.1334 × [Habitat Quality])) + (0.168 × [precipitation (cm)]). Because there is no upper bound to this equation, we bounded maximum fledgling production by the largest empirical estimate (i.e., 2.19 male fledglings per male; Shake &amp; Mattsson, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1975</xref>). To simulate baseline annual habitat quality, we used a Gaussian distribution parameterized using the estimated mean habitat quality across all suitable jack pine stands in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan from 2004 to 2013 (mean = 2.35, 
    <italic>SD</italic> = 0.05).

   <title>BREEDING GROUNDS CARRYING CAPACITY ESTIMATION</title>
   <p>Annual breeding grounds carrying capacity is influenced by quantity and quality of breeding habitat, with quality reflected by density of Kirtland's Warblers (Bocetti, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Probst, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). Huber, Kintigh, and Sjogren (
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) quantified mean density of male Kirtland's Warblers across all occupied stands on state and federal Kirtland's Warbler Management Areas (KWMA) in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, USA, between 2001 and 2012, and the U.S. Forest Service continued to quantify mean density on federal KWMAs through 2017. These data show that annual mean density is typically higher on federal KWMAs (located in the core of the breeding range) and that mean density on federal KWMAs increased by 32% between 2003 and 2004 (Figure 
    <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">A1</xref>). For this study, we characterized annual variation in density using annual density estimates from 2004 to 2017. To estimate annual density for state land from 2013 to 2017, we used the mean of the observed densities on state land from 2004 to 2012. We then computed average annual density for the northern Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan as the mean of the state and federal land estimates, weighted by proportion of occupied habitat on state and federal land. The mean density was 0.1307 ± 0.0076 males/ha.
   </p>
   <p>The Kirtland's Warbler Conservation Team defined 14,593 ha as the target for annual breeding habitat availability (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and we used this as our baseline annual breeding habitat quantity. To obtain annual carrying capacity, we multiplied quantity of breeding habitat by estimated density: 1,907 ± 111 males. Thus, the carrying capacity model accounted for annual variability in mean quality of habitat, reflected in changes in mean density. When the model population exceeded the carrying capacity, reproduction was restricted to the carrying capacity, with the remaining individuals allowed to survive, but not reproduce.

   <title>WINTERING GROUNDS CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS</title>
   <p>To estimate potential climate change impacts on wintering grounds habitat quality, we projected proportional changes in average March precipitation in 2100 relative to baseline precipitation for the focal Bahamian islands. The spatial data used were derived from the most current General Circulation Models (GCM) developed for the fifth Coupled Model Inter‐comparison Project (CMIP5), which corresponds to Assessment Report 5 of the IPCC (IPCC, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These GCM data were statistically downscaled from 0.5° × 0.5° (ca. 50 km × 50 km) resolution to 0.008° × 0.008° (ca. 1 km × 1 km) using pattern scaling (Tebaldi &amp; Arblaster, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The baseline precipitation and temperature data were derived from the 20‐year observation period between 1986 and 2005 (IPCC, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
   </p>
   <p>We used an ensemble of 40 GCMs, with mid‐equilibrium climate sensitivity levels (equilibrium climate sensitivity represents the expected atmospheric warming in response to a doubling of CO
    <sub>2</sub> [IPCC, 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>]), and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which assumes CO
    <sub>2</sub> emissions will continue to increase over the next century (Moss et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). We used the median (−0.055), lower 25th percentile (−0.331), and lower 10th percentile (−0.558) of projected end‐of‐century changes in March precipitation based on the GCM ensemble. Additional information on the climate change projections used here can be found in Wolcott et al. (
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). We note there is much greater uncertainty for projecting future precipitation compared to temperature, and some models did project increases in March precipitation. However, we did not include scenarios where precipitation increases because the Kirtland's Warbler population is already stable with current wintering grounds precipitation levels (Brown et al., 
    <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
