  <p>Kirtland's Warbler (
   <italic>Setophaga kirtlandii</italic>) population simulation model developed using the program STELLA Professional (version 1.7.1). The model contains stocks (rectangles) that hold birds during discrete time steps, flows (clouds and regulators connected by arrows) that move birds into and out of stocks (potentially using an equation, such as NewBirdsIn), converters (circles) that contain values or equations and influence flows, and connectors (arrows) that link the model components. Converters with broken lines indicate “ghosts,” where the original converter is located elsewhere in the model. The “Adults” submodel tracks movement of adults through the annual cycle. Adults and juveniles that survive through the nonbreeding period are added as potential breeders each year, and adult annual survival is influenced by precipitation on the wintering grounds. The “Reproduction” submodel simulates the new breeders produced each year. Annual productivity is influenced by precipitation on the wintering grounds, breeding grounds habitat suitability, breeding grounds carrying capacity, and number of potential breeders. The “Precipitation” submodel is used for tracking precipitation in year X and X−1. The “Habitat” submodel contains statistical distributions to draw annual values for wintering grounds precipitation (Prand), breeding grounds habitat suitability (HSrand), and breeding grounds carrying capacity (Krand). Each year, 
   <italic>z</italic>‐score values are drawn and used to obtain the corresponding HSrand and Krand values, whereas Prand values are independently drawn
