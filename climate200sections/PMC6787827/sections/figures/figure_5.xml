  <p>Impacts of simulated effects of environmental and management changes on abundance of the Kirtland's Warbler (
   <italic>Setophaga kirtlandii</italic>) over 100 years. Models include reduced wintering grounds habitat quality (WQL; median, 25th percentile, and 10th percentile of climate models projecting end‐of‐century changes in March precipitation under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), reduced breeding grounds habitat quantity due to climate (BQN‐C) and management (BQN‐M) changes, and reduced breeding grounds habitat quality due to management changes (BQL). The contemporary model reflects current environmental and management conditions on the wintering and breeding grounds. The WQL (10th%) + BQN‐C + BQL model represents that most extreme environmental change of all modeled scenarios. The dark solid line shows the mean number of males per year from 1,000 independent simulations. The gray lines show the standard deviation each year, and the dotted lines show the maximum and minimum number of males each year across all simulations. The dark horizontal dashed lines represent the management target of 1,000 males and critical threshold of 200 males
