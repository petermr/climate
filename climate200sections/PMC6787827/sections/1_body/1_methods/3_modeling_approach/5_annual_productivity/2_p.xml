<p>Annual per capita fledgling production was modeled as a function of wintering and breeding grounds habitat quality (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35547-app-0001" ref-type="app">1</xref>). Rockwell et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) found total March precipitation recorded at the Nassau NOAA weather station was a strong predictor of subsequent male fledgling production. Habitat quality on the breeding grounds influences productivity by affecting pairing success (Probst, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>; Rockwell, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). To allow both wintering and breeding grounds habitat quality to influence production of new males, our equation included two predictive components. The first component estimated baseline productivity based on mean annual breeding grounds habitat quality (0.678 + 0.1334 [HQ]; Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35547-app-0001" ref-type="app">1</xref>). The second component estimated productivity above the baseline with every 1 cm increase in precipitation (0.168 [P]). We note this is the same approach used in Brown et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), but the equations differ because here we modeled hatch‐year survival separately, rather than accounting for survival in a prebreeding census matrix model. We bounded maximum fledgling production by the highest empirical estimate of 2.19 male fledglings per male (Shake &amp; Mattsson, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1975</xref>).
