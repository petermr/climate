<p>We used our simulation model to project Kirtland's Warbler population dynamics based on contemporary and potential future environmental and management conditions. We tested independent and additive effects of changes in wintering grounds habitat quality and breeding grounds habitat quantity and quality (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To model influences of future environmental changes, we modified contemporary environmental distributions by multiplying their annual values by a proportional change value, thus retaining environmental stochasticity while allowing for directional changes. We did not include a gradual change in environmental values from contemporary to future conditions.
