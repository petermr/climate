<p>To estimate potential management change impacts on breeding grounds habitat quantity, we used a reduction in breeding habitat quantity of 25% (Michigan Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish, and Wildlife Service, &amp; U. S. Forest Service, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This represents a worst‚Äêcase management scenario, where experimental plantations do not provide habitat for Kirtland's Warblers. To estimate potential management change impacts on breeding grounds habitat quality, we replaced 25% of high suitability habitat with low suitability habitat, thus reducing mean habitat suitability. This scenario assumes that experimental plantations continue to provide habitat for Kirtland's Warblers, but habitat quality is reduced.
