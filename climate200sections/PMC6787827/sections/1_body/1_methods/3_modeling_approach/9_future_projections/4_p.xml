<p>To estimate potential climate change impacts on breeding grounds habitat quantity, we projected end‐of‐century suitable habitat for jack pine occurrence in the LP of Michigan based on median end‐of‐century climate estimates from 31 GCMs and RCP 8.5 (Donner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). We then determined the proportion of contemporary Kirtland's Warbler habitat (2004–2013; Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) that was located in areas that are projected to become climatically unsuitable for jack pine. This resulted in a mean reduction in breeding habitat of 48.7 ± 3.2%.
