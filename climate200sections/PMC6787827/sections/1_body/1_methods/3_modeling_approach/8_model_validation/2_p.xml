<p>We tested if incorporating temporal variation in wintering grounds habitat quality improved model performance compared to only considering dynamic environmental conditions on the breeding grounds. For this comparison, we created a breeding grounds‐only model, with annual survival and fledgling production representing the mean estimates from Rockwell et al. (

 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We then deterministically simulated abundances from 2001 to 2012 using observed environmental data and compared the output of each model to observed abundances from the annual Kirtland's Warbler breeding male census (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Incorporating dynamic wintering grounds habitat quality resulted in a more accurate reconstruction of historical abundances (sum of squared deviations from observed abundance = 496,237 and 189,940 for the breeding grounds‐only and dynamic wintering grounds model, respectively; Figure
