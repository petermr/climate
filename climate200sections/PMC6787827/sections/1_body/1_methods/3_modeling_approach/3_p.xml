<p>In our model, the Kirtland's Warbler population moved through four subtime steps annually: breeding grounds, fall migration, wintering grounds, and spring migration (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Environmental conditions on the breeding grounds influenced productivity, and environmental conditions on the wintering grounds influenced survival and productivity. For Kirtland's Warbler, currently there are no quantitative data linking dynamic environmental conditions during the migratory periods to population vital rates, but the model can accommodate this information in the future. Most of the data available for model parameterization were based on male observations, and thus, we used a single‚Äêsex model based on male empirical data for this study.
