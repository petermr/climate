<p>We incorporated environmental stochasticity in breeding grounds habitat quality and wintering grounds precipitation. In our model, annual productivity and carrying capacity are both influenced by habitat quality, but use different Gaussian distributions (i.e., productivity uses a habitat quality index and carrying capacity uses mean density of Kirtland's Warblers). To align annual habitat quality for the two parameters, we specified the model to draw a habitat quality value from a 
 <italic>z</italic>‐distribution (mean = 0, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1) and then transformed the 
 <italic>z</italic>‐score to create the corresponding value for each distribution: Value = mean + (
 <italic>z</italic>‐score × 
 <italic>SD</italic>).
