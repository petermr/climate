<p>In a previous study, we projected the influence of potential breeding grounds management changes on long‐term population viability of the Kirtland's Warbler, while also accounting for the influence of dynamic wintering grounds habitat quality based on contemporary climate conditions (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In this study, we build from that initial work by projecting independent and additive effects of climate and management changes on long‐term population viability of the Kirtland's Warbler. To achieve this objective, we developed a population‐level simulation model that incorporates the influence of annual environmental conditions on the breeding and wintering grounds, and investigated effects of reduced breeding grounds habitat quantity and quality, and wintering grounds habitat quality, on population viability. We did not consider effects of changes in wintering grounds habitat quantity because carrying capacity of Kirtland's Warblers is strongly associated with food availability, which varies annually and seasonally due to weather variability (Wunderle et al.,
