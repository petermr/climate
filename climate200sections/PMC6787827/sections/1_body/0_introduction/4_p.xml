<p>On the wintering grounds, availability of food resources can regulate population dynamics by influencing annual survival and fecundity (Holmes, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Norris, Marra, Kyser, Sherry, &amp; Ratcliffe, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In the neotropics, food resource availability has been shown to influence body condition of migratory birds and to be positively correlated with precipitation (Studds &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Wunderle, Lebow, White, Currie, &amp; Ewert, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). As the climate changes, spatial and temporal weather patterns in the neotropics are changing, with seasonal drying trends in some regions (Karmalkar et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Wolcott, Donner, Brown, &amp; Ribic, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Decreases in precipitation during the spring premigration period could have particularly strong negative impacts on migratory bird populations (Rockwell et al.,
