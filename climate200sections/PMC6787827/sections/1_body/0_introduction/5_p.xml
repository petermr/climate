<p>One Neotropical migratory bird that is potentially highly vulnerable to climate change is the Kirtland's Warbler (
 <italic>Setophaga kirtlandii</italic>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), a species that breeds almost exclusively in the northern Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan, and winters in the Bahamian archipelago (Cooper, Hallworth, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Probst, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). Kirtland's Warbler is considered the rarest songbird in North America (Wilson, Marra, &amp; Fleischer, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and has been listed as federally endangered since 1970 (Bureau of Sports Fisheries &amp; Wildlife, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">1970</xref>). Due to aggressive and collaborative management actions, coupled with the pivotal &gt;24,000‚Äêha Mack Lake wildfire, the species has recovered from ca. 200 breeding males in 1971 to over 2,000 breeding males today (Bocetti, Goble, &amp; Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and is currently proposed to be delisted under the Endangered Species Act.
