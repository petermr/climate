<p>In addition to potential climate change impacts, future changes in management of Kirtland's Warbler breeding grounds habitat could impact long‐term population viability. The recovery of the species can be attributed to two major management initiatives: increasing recruitment through removal of Brown‐headed Cowbirds (
