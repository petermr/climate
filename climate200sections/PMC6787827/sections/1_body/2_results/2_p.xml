<p>Under contemporary environmental and management conditions, the population was stable over the 100‚Äêyear simulation period (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with a mean annual abundance of ca. 2,500 males (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Under contemporary environmental and management conditions, 4.9% of simulations resulted in a population that fell below the management target of 1,000 males, but no simulations fell below the critical threshold of 200 males.
