<p>While our model only considered the impacts of decreased precipitation on the wintering grounds, temperature is also projected to increase (Wolcott et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Even if mean March precipitation remains constant, arthropod and fruit availability will likely decrease during this critical premigration period due to increased temperature stress and evapotranspiration rates (Bounoua et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Lister &amp; Garcia, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Thus, while the median projected end‐of‐century change in March precipitation did not indicate the population was at risk of extinction, this should be considered a conservative projection. Additional research is needed to quantify how temperature and precipitation interact to influence food abundance for Kirtland's Warbler (Wunderle et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
