<p>The potential future scenarios we modeled in this study were based on the assumption that managers would not be responsive to reductions in breeding grounds habitat quantity caused by a contraction in the suitable climate zone for jack pine or unsuitability of experimental plantations. Realistically, we would expect managers to respond by changing the spatial distribution of KWMAs or discontinuing unsuitable experimental plantation designs, respectively. The purpose of these scenarios was to quantify the importance of breeding habitat quantity for maintaining a robust Kirtland's Warbler population. For this study, we also assumed that Kirtland's Warblers will not adapt to climate changes by modifying their wintering distribution, breeding distribution, or temporal activity cycle. We acknowledge that long‚Äêterm bird monitoring data sets indicate distributional shifts in response to climate change are already occurring for some species (e.g., La Sorte &amp; Thompson,

 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). However, thus far there is no indication that the wintering distribution of Kirtland's Warblers is changing, and without additional human intervention, there is little opportunity for a major distributional change on the breeding grounds due to strict habitat requirements. Further, the LP of Michigan will likely continue be the most suitable region for jack pine in the Upper Midwest, USA (Donner et al.,
