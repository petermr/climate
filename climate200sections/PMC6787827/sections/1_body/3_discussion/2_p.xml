<p>Our study indicates the Kirtland's Warbler population is stable under current environmental and management conditions, consistent with our previous simulation study (Brown et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and long‐term monitoring data (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Based on our results, probability of long‐term persistence for this species will depend on how wintering grounds habitat quality changes (i.e., how much March precipitation changes in the central Bahamas). Quantity of breeding grounds habitat was an important determinant of whether or not the population remained above the management target of 1,000 breeding males, but loss of breeding habitat alone (up to 48.7%) did not cause extinction.
