<p>Field surveys were conducted by a systematically sampling procedure. In August 2014, a 100 m (along a contour line) × 1600 m (along the elevation) survey strip ranging from 2050 m to 2300 m a.s.l. was established within the tundra zone on the west side of the Changbai Mountain volcanic cones (

At intervals of 50 m along the slope within this strip, four 1 m × 1 m plots were laid out laterally and uniformly, and a total of 132 plots (i.e., 33 rows × 4 plots/row were established (

The latitude and longitude, elevation (as measured by the GPS), slope, and aspect (as measured by the compass) were recorded for each plot. In each plot, the number of plant species, number of individuals, and cover (%) of each species were measured in August 2014. The plant coverage measurement used one of the most frequently-used visual estimation method.
