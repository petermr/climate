<p>The Changbai Mountains (41°23’N–42°36’N, 126°55’E–129°E), located in Southeastern Jilin Province, China, rise as a mountainous boundary between China and North Korea and form the highest mountains in Northeastern China (2,691 m). The steep terrain, climate, and soil create a distinct vertical profile of vegetation types. From low to high elevations in the mountains, the vegetation changes from a mixed broadleaf–coniferous forest (600–1600 m a.s.l.), coniferous forest (1600–1800 m a.s.l.), and a subalpine mountain birch forest (1800–2050 m a.s.l.), to the alpine tundra (2050–2691 m a.s.l.).</p>
