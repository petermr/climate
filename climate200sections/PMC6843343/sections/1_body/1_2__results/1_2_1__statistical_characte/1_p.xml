<p>Among the eight dominant species, 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> had the highest abundance and the smallest coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis (

 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> had a relatively uniform and wide distribution, which was close to a normal distribution in the tundra zone. By contrast, 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> had the lowest abundance but the largest coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis among the eight species (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> had the largest positive skewness. Its distribution is positively skewed with a mean value to the right of the peak value. 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> had larger abundance only in a few plots and had the highest positive kurtosis (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
