<p>Except for

 <italic>S. parviflora</italic>, elevation significantly affected the abundance of the other six species (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Differences existed in the distribution of the two dominant shrub species along the elevational gradient in the strip. The abundance of 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> was the highest, while the abundance of 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> was the lowest along the elevational gradient among the eight dominant species (

 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> did not differ with elevation (

 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> was significantly different along the elevational gradient (
