<p>The descriptive statistics characteristics (mean, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis) of abundance for the two shrub dominant species indicated that 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> was more sensitive than 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic>. 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> has a strong resistance to herbaceous plant expansion and it still had a relatively uniform and wide distribution in the tundra zone. The abundance of 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> showed the largest positive skewness and kurtosis, which indicates that 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> had a patch distribution in a particular habitat.
