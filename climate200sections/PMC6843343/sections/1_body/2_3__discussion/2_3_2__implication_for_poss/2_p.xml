<p>Our results showed that herbs typically existed on semi-sunny slopes, steep slopes, and depression. It means that micro-topography and slope grade play a greater role in determining herbs invasion, which supported previous results [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After 30 years of vegetation change, shrubs have been replaced by herbs in a considerate part of the tundra. The reason might be effects of tundra climate change associated with air warming, increased precipitation, and decreased snow cover on vegetation [
