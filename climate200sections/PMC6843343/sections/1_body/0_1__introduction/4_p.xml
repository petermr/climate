<p>The frigid climate and thin mountain soil support polar or alpine plant species that account for about 80% of the total plant species in the Changbai alpine tundra. Qian and Zhang (1980) [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Huang and Li (1984) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and Qian (1990) [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] investigated the community structure and identified the dominant species in the tundra and results showed that the dominant shrub species were 
 <italic>Dryas octopetala</italic>, 
 <italic>Phyllodocecaerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhododendron chrysanthum</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhododendron confertissimum</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhododendron redowskianum</italic>, 
 <italic>Vaccinium uliginosum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</italic>. The dominant plants are mainly shrubs (
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> and 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic>), and the community has a shrub and a moss-lichen layer, but lacks an herbaceous layer [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains is considered as a shrub tundra. Herbaceous plants such as 
 <italic>Calamagrostis angustifolia</italic> form the lower elevation ‘
 <italic>Betula ermanii</italic> zone’ have invaded the alpine tundra zone on the Changbai Mountains since the 1990s [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> was not recorded by Qian’s surveys [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> individuals have been found in a few plots surveyed by Huang (1984) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and is now widespread and distributed in the tundra [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Zong et al. (2013) [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] revealed, based on spectral and image analysis, that the incursion of 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> from lower elevations to higher elevations started in the 1980s, and has successfully invaded the alpine tundra landscape since the 21st century. Currently, the 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> patches at lower elevations under the tundra are interconnected, and form relatively large patches after years of expansion. At higher elevations in the tundra landscape, more herbaceous species such as 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> encroached on the tundra zone [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Jin et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggest that herbaceous species have now been forming patches on the alpine tundra zone and becoming a co-dominant plant species with shrubs that have correspondingly been becoming fragmented and patchy. Therefore, the tundra seems to be transforming into alpine meadows [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
