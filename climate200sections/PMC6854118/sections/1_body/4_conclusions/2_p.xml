<p>It is important to understand how climate change through time affects the distribution and abundance of novel and disappeared climates, as well as how choice in gridded climate data resolution affects our estimations of climate change. If our 60 m downscaled climate surfaces accurately reflect physiographic processes affecting climate at multiple scales, our fine‐scale climate products should improve estimations of novel and disappeared climate distributions, compared to coarser climate products, especially in areas with high topographic complexity.</p>
