<p>The positive relationship between spatial resolution and novel and disappeared climate distributions suggests that the use of coarse grid climate data may have led to the overestimation of novel and disappeared climate distributions in previous analyses, and thereby cause overestimates of potential impacts of climate change. This may lead to significant errors when trying to determine where postglacial climate change has occurred. Additionally, this error can be propagated into other analyses that depend on climate grid data, such as species distribution models, which implies that these studies may also over or underestimate predicted species ranges, refugial locations, and other climate‚Äêspecies analyses (Franklin et al.,
