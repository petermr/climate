<p>In our study, the amount of novel and disappeared climate distributions was affected by climate grid resolution in two primary ways. First, as climate data becomes coarser, there is a positive relationship between the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates and spatial resolution. This pattern occurs for two reasons: (a) Coarser climate data reduced environmental variability, which in turn removes the extreme ranges of climate, and (b) there are fewer climates that fall within the shared climate bin definition, resulting in fewer climates classified as shared while simultaneously increasing the frequency of novel or disappeared climates simply due to the coarser scales (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). As expected, all shared climates displayed a negative relationship between climate resolution and fractional area (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). Shared climates should display a negative relationship because as the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates increases with spatial resolution, the fractional area of shared climates must decrease because it accounts for areas not classified as either novel or disappeared.

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) found similar results modeling species distributions, finding that coarse climate data predicts larger suitable habitats compared to finer resolution climate data. Our study confirms this trend, although our analysis is focused solely on the distribution of climate as opposed to the distribution of species.
