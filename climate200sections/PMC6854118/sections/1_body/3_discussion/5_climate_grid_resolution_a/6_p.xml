<p>No significant relationship between fractional area of novel and disappeared climates and spatial resolution is possible, and this pattern did not visibly arise within our study. There were some cases where the Spearman's rank correlation was “moderate”, although this does not necessarily indicate a relationship. However, while all surfaces displayed moderate to strong correlations, there was a fair amount of variation in fractional area as spatial resolution became coarser. This suggests that there may be significant thresholds occurring at various spatial scales. The exact causes of this variation are still unclear, but we hypothesize that this variation may be a result of distortion caused by aliasing artifacts when upsampling our 60 m downscaled climate surfaces to coarser scales (Haines‐Young &amp; Chopping,

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) producing overlooked oscillations across a landscape. While Moiré fringes are a well‐known issue affecting raster image processing and visualization, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether naturally occurring processes and phenomenon known to influence climate or other Earth systems, generate spatial Moiré distributions.
