<p>Since novel and disappeared climates identify areas most affected by climate change, shared climates fundamentally capture regions that have been least affected by postglacial climate change. Novel and disappeared climates largely affected Southern Alaska, resulting in lower fractional areas of shared climates in the south, and higher fractional areas in the North. As expected, the most northern ecoregions of the state, the Arctic Tundra, Bering Tundra, and Intermontane Boreal ecoregions, contained the largest amount of shared climates, while the southernmost ecoregions, the Coast and Pacific Mountain Transition ecoregions, contained the least amount of shared climates.</p>
