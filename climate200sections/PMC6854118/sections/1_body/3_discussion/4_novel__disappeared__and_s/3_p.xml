<p>Therefore, the combination of these two effects produced no unique rain values for our LGM climate surfaces. Overall, disappeared climates primarily affected the southeastern Coast Mountain and Pacific Mountain Transition ecoregions, where modern climate has significantly warmed causing the extremely low maximum temperature climates of the LGM to disappear. Disappeared snow climates primarily affected the Southern Coastal Rainforest ecoregion, where more precipitation now falls as rain, as opposed to snow during the LGM, causing high levels of LGM snow climates to disappear for the modern era. While the fractional area of disappeared climates in Western Alaska was not as high as Southern Alaska, the Aleutian Meadows and Bering Taiga ecoregions experienced some disappeared AET and PET climates, likely as a result of higher radiation climates during the LGM than the modern era. There is some evidence from paleoclimate simulations that suggests less atmospheric water vapor reduced the amount of low‐level clouds and increased the amount of high‐level clouds, which could result in increased surface radiation while still producing a cooling effect over arctic regions during the LGM (Webb, Rind, Lehman, Healy, &amp; Sigman,
