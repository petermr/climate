<p>Second, large fractional areas of novel or disappeared climate do not necessarily equate to ecological significance for a species (e.g., niche theory). For example, a species may have a large temperature threshold (generalist) with a low snow threshold (specialist). Even with the significant warming of the LGM (85.0% disappeared

 <sub>max</sub>), 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> climates may still fall within the optimal range of the species. However, while changes to LGM snow climates were low (2.3% disappeared snow), this change may be ecologically risky for the species if the changes fall outside its optimal snow range. In this case, disappeared snow climates are significant to a species, not disappeared 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> climates, even though there was a far greater fractional area of disappeared 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> climates. This suggests that disappeared or novel climates may only be important if they are a limiting factor or extend beyond the optimal niche for a species (De Baar, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Vandermeer, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>). If the change in climate is a limiting factor, the risk of distribution shifts or extirpation may increase for a species. However, if the change in climate is not limiting, the existence of novel and disappeared climates may have minimal impacts on a species.
