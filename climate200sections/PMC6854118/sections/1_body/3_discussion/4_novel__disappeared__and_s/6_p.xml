<p>The occurrence of both novel and disappeared climates existing at the same location on our downscaled climate surfaces was virtually nonexistent.

 <sub>min</sub> contained a few pixels (11) classified as both novel and disappeared; however, this phenomenon was deemed insignificant because it covered such a small fraction of Alaska's area. At larger spatial resolutions, there are instances where some climate variables have a substantial increase in both novel and disappeared climates occurring at the same location. However, areas where both novel and disappeared climates occurred at the same location at resolutions &gt;60Â m were not considered for analysis on the distribution of novel and disappeared climates. Novel and disappeared climates are an important characterization of climate change that help identify the vulnerability of ecoregions, since they can push species beyond their ideal climate space and lead to ecologically risky scenarios such as migration, range shifts, and extinction. The Aleutian Meadows and Coastal Rainforests of Alaska stood out as the most vulnerable ecoregions to postglacial climate change. These two regions generally experienced both large amounts of novel and disappeared climates across all climate variables when compared to all other ecoregions in Alaska. Ecoregions with large shared climate distributions may have important implications for identifying glacial refugia because they represent regions that have experienced the least climate change through time and contain the most stable climates in Alaska. The Bering Tundra was the least vulnerable Alaskan ecoregion to postglacial climate change, as all variables in the region contained extremely low fractional areas of novel or disappeared climates.
