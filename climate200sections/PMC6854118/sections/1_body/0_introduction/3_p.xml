<p>Niche theory predicts that 
 <italic>n</italic>‐dimensional changes in the environment (e.g., precipitation and temperature) will cause shifts in species distributions and the formation of novel species assemblages, since every species responds individualistically to its abiotic and biotic environment (Hutchinson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">1957</xref>; Jackson &amp; Overpeck, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). This assumption has been supported by large changes in species ranges where past climates lacked modern analogs, leading to the formation of novel LGM species associations and biomes with no modern equivalent (Williams &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Therefore, variations of climate in space and time (e.g., LGM vs. Modern 
 <italic>n</italic>‐dimensional environment) are thought to be an important factor in understanding the formation of novel and disappeared climates, as well as the expansion and contraction of a species' niche and distribution (Ackerly et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Novel climates are climatic environments with no‐analog conditions in the past, whereas disappeared climates are climatic environments with no‐analog conditions today (Ackerly et al.,
