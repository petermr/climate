<p>There are many ways climate data can be used to describe shifts in climate, with the most extreme description being the detection of no‐analog climates. No‐analog climate techniques identify a location or period the climate of which is dissimilar to that in another context (Ford et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), and then classify the climate into spatial and/or temporal categories (Mearns et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). For example, spatial and temporal classifications of no‐analog climates typically describe local climate change using a dissimilarity metric (Grenier, Parent, Huard, Anctil, &amp; Chaumont, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; e.g., Standardized Euclidean Distance) at the same grid cell between climate variables at two difference time periods, and then compare the climate realization for each land gridpoint from one time period the climate realization of all land gridpoints of the other time period, while retaining the minimum dissimilarity metric value (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Fordham, Saltré, Brown, Mellin, &amp; Wigley, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Grenier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Ordonez, Williams, &amp; Svenning, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Williams, Jackson, &amp; Kutzbacht, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Other approaches have computed no‐analog climates relying only on temporal classifications of novel and disappeared climates. For example, Fitzpatrick and Hargrove (
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) utilized techniques employed by species distribution models to identify no‐analog climates in the future (areas where the current climate conditions of a study area do not exist in projected future climate), Burrows et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) calculated shifting climates using climate velocity (Burrows et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Dobrowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Loarie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) to identify source (novel) and sink (disappeared) areas, and Wiens, Seavy, and Jongsomjit (
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) employed PCA analysis to collapse multidimensional climate into a single climate space to derive polygons encompassing current and future climate space to identify persisting climates, disappearing climates, and novel climates.
