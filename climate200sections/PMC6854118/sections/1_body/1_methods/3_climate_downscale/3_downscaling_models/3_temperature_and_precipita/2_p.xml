<p>We calibrated these models using weather station data to represent the high‐resolution climate linked with the GCM climate grids that correspond to the date of the weather measurement. To determine variable selection, we used a random forest algorithm to derive variable importance statistics for all model parameters at a variety of spatial scales (60 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 5 km; Breiman,

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The remaining 20% of weather station data (10,943 observations) was used for model validation, in which we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient, and percent bias. We created a precipitation model employing similar methods previously used to create our temperature models; however, the precipitation model was trained using a stratified sampling procedure (vs. 80% dataset) to ensure an equal proportion of measured weather station precipitation values were represented in the training dataset since the majority of weather observations recorded 0 mm/month precipitation. The training dataset was stratified in ~310 mm width bins from randomly sampling 80% of the original precipitation dataset. We then randomly sampled 5,000 precipitation values from each bin to create the final training dataset. Our testing dataset was comprised from the remaining 20% of the original precipitation dataset.
