<p>AET and DEF were calculated at monthly time scales at 60 m for the LGM and modern era, by using a snow hydrology model that models additional water and energy parameters that influence available water at a site (Dobrowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Downscaled precipitation, mean temperature, and radiation were used to estimate the fraction of precipitation arising as either rainfall, snowfall, snowpack, or snowmelt during a given month at 60‐m resolution for both the LGM and modern eras (Lutz, Van Wagtendonk &amp; Franklin, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Dobrowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These products were then used to calculate AET and DEF in combination with PET and a coarse soil water‐holding capacity surface (Dunne &amp; Willmott, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>) to determine the available plant extractable water from rainfall or snowmelt from the previous month (Dobrowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). A spatially constant available soil water‐holding capacity (AWC) value of 5.0 cm (the mean AWC of Alaska) was used rather than a spatially varying AWC due to a lack of high‐resolution AWC products in Alaska (Dunne &amp; Willmott, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). The model first determines the amount of maximum potential available soil water at a site. If there is an excess of soil water, AET is the same as PET because evapotranspiration is not limited by water availability. However, if available water is less than the sites maximum potential available water, AET will be less than PET (AET = PET − DEF), because maximum water evaporative demand cannot be met by the available amount of water present at the site. We created annual summaries of each surface (AET, DEF, snow, and rain) by computing the summation all monthly surfaces, for each climate variable, for each individual era.
