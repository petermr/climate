<p>An elevation surface was assembled for the entire state of Alaska using U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) 1 arc‐second (~60 m) digital elevation maps (DEM; USGS, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The digital elevation map (DEM) was resampled and reprojected to Alaska Albers Equal Area Conic, ensuring grid cells of exactly 60 m. From this dataset, we calculated slope, aspect, and the topographic convergence index (TCI) for Alaska (Wolock &amp; McCabe, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). TCI was calculated with TauDEM using a D‐infinity flow accumulation algorithm (Tesfa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Regions where slope was 0° were given a placeholder value of 0.001 when calculating TCI to avoid divide‐by‐zero issues.
