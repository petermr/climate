<p>Novel and disappeared climate distributions for each climate surface were computed at all resolutions and eras from the reclassified climate surfaces. Novel climates were defined as modern climate bins that did not exist during the LGM and disappeared climates as LGM climate bins that did not exist in the modern period (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Using these definitions, we then determined which bins constituted novel, disappeared, or shared climates for each climate variable and era. Pixels for each climate surface, resolution, and era were reclassified to (a) novel, (b) disappeared, (c) shared, or (d) novel and disappeared climates based on each variable's novel and disappeared bin definitions. If a specific climate existed only during the LGM, the climate range was considered “disappeared” (blue pixels; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). If a specific climate exists only in the modern era, the climate range was considered “novel” (red pixels; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). If a specific climate existed during both time periods, the climate was considered “shared” (black pixels), as that specific range of climate could be found either during the LGM or modern era within the extent of Alaska (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,c). Lastly, it is possible for a specific climate range to be both novel and disappeared at the same location. For instance, during the LGM, minimum temperatures at some locations were so cold they are not observed in the modern era. However, in the exact same location during the modern era, minimum temperatures may have warmed so much due to anthropogenic climate change that they were not present during the LGM. If a specific climate was both novel and disappeared at the same location, the climate range was considered “both” (purple pixels; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).
