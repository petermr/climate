<p>The first step of our analysis was to perform a topographically mediated downscaling of coarse‐scale modern and LGM climate surfaces to a resolution of 60 m for the modern and LGM periods. Next, we upsampled these surfaces to coarser resolutions. Finally, we performed our analysis investigating the impacts of scale on the distribution of shared, novel, and disappeared climates throughout Alaska.</p>
