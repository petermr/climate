<p>All temperature model (

 <sub>ave</sub> models suggest that all models were well calibrated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a–c). Independent variables (

 <sub>Coarse,</sub> elevation, TCI, and radiation) for all three temperature models had significant 
 <italic>p</italic>‐values of &lt;0.001, confirming the importance of all model predictors. In all three models, coarse modeled temperature, followed closely by radiation, was the most significant contributor to model performance. Elevation and TCI, while still important, were less significant as determined by exploratory random forest model variable importance plots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a–c).
