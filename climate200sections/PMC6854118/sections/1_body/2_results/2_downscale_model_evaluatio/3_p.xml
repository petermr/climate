<p>All model assumptions of the precipitation GLM were met. As expected, our precipitation model correlation was lower than our temperature downscale models, with a higher RMSE and percent bias, because downscaling procedures for modeling precipitation are less well understood than downscale temperature methods. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.59), RMSE (0.90 mm), and percent bias (0.91) for the precipitation model indicated that the basic GLM model was not as well calibrated (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). However, the precipitation model's correlation falls within the range of reported correlation values from other previously downscale precipitation products, indicating that our precipitation model is acceptable given preceding precipitation model standards (Cannon,

 <sub>coarse</sub>, log(elevation), log(slope), wind direction, and orographic effects) had significant 
 <italic>p</italic>‐values of &lt;&lt;.001, again, validating our choice in predictors. Wind speed was the least significant predictor for our precipitation model with a 
 <italic>p</italic>‐value of .0961; however, wind speed was still somewhat beneficial in predicting precipitation patterns across Alaska. Overall, elevation was the most significant predictor of precipitation, followed by slope, coarse modeled precipitation, orographic effects, wind speed, and lastly, wind direction as the weakest predictor as indicated by our random forest variable importance plots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d).
