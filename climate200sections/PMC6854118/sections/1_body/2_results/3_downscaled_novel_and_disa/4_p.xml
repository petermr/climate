<p>Shared climates were defined as climates that existed during both the LGM and modern eras. As expected, all eight climate surfaces contained shared climates throughout Alaska, since no climate surface was classified as 100% novel or disappeared. Overall, shared climates generally covered more of Alaska than novel or disappeared climates, with a minimum fractional area of 40.6%. Shared water deficit climates covered 97.1% of the state, indicating water deficit climates have changed least in Alaska (Table

 <sub>max</sub> climates have changed the most in the state from the LGM to modern era (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35511-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This was expected as water deficit contained no novel climates and the lowest amount of disappeared climates, while

 <sub>max</sub> contained no novel climates, but the largest amount of disappeared climates in Alaska. While all Alaskan ecoregions contained various amounts of shared climates, there were isolated cases where ecoregions were &lt;80% shared, although this was expected whenever high novel or disappeared climates covered the same ecoregion and climate variable (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The Arctic Tundra, Bering Tundra, and Intermontane Boreal ecoregions contained the highest overall shared climate distributions in Alaska at 84.9%, 98.28%, and 75.3%, indicating that these ecoregions are generally less affected by postglacial climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The Coast and Pacific Mountain Transition ecoregions experienced the lowest amounts of shared climates at 15.0% and 17.5%, indicating that these ecoregions are generally more affected by postglacial climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
