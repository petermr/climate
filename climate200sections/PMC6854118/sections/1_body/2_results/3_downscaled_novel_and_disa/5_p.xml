 <sub>min</sub> climates displayed this phenomenon in Alaska at 60‐m resolution and was determined to be insignificant as it only covered &lt;0.001% (39.6 km
 <sup>2</sup>) of Alaska. At coarser resolutions, there was a noticeable increase in climates classified as “both” novel and disappeared for some climate surfaces at a location; however, this portion of the results concentrates on our high‐resolution downscaled climate surfaces (“both” climates vs. spatial resolution is discussed in the next section).
