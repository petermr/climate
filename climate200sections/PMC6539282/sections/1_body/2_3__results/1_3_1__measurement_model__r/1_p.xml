<p>Reliability and convergent validity analysis results for each construct are presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01606-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Fornell and Larcker [
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] stated that a Cronbach’s α coefficient of greater than 0.7 indicates high reliability, whereas a coefficient lower than 0.35 indicates low reliability. The Cronbach’s alpha of each dimension was greater than 0.80, indicating good reliability [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Hair et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] suggested that the composite reliability (CR) of latent variables should be greater than 0.70. A high CR of latent variables for an examined variable indicates that the examined variable is valid for use in measuring the latent variable. The CR of the variables in this study ranged from 0.713 to 0.940, indicating that this model had good internal consistency. The average variance extracted (AVE) for each factor was between 0.560 and 0.839, which is higher than the recommended benchmark of 0.5 [
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. However, the value of factor loading (0.624–0.952) was higher than the recommended level of 0.6 [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Means, standard deviations, and correlations among the constructs are presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01606-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Significant positive correlations were found to exist between attitude and purchase intention (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.39, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), subjective norm and purchase intention (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.40, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), perceived behavioral control and purchase intention (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and environmental concern and purchase intention (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). These results indicate that the higher the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and environmental concern of consumers, the stronger their purchase intention to insect food. By contrast, food neophobia exhibited a significant negative correlation with purchase intention (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.40, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), indicating that the higher the food neophobia of consumers, the weaker their purchase intention to insect food.
