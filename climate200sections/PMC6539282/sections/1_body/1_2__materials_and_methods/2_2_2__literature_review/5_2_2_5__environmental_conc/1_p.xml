<p>Minton and Rose [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] define environmental concern as the general attitude toward preserving the environment. Newton et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] assert that environmental concern does not directly affect purchase intention but rather allows consumers to understand the environmental result produced by purchasing a product. Furthermore, Arisal and Atalar [
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] note that collectivists are more attentive toward environmental topics and find that environmental concern affects individual purchase intention. Collectivists involve emotions such as empathy and indebtedness [

 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Some examples of public benefits include improved environmental outcomes and enhanced animal welfare [

 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] notes that environmental concern is the second major index for forecasting green purchasing behaviors. In summary, environmental concern is correlated with purchase intention, and on this basis, we propose hypothesis 4:

  <p>Consumers’ environmental concerns positively and significantly affect their purchase intention toward insect foods.</p>
