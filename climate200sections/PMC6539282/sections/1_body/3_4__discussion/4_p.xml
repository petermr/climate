<p>Finally, consumers’ food neophobia was significantly and negatively correlated with their intention to purchase insect foods (β = −0.526, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), thus supporting H5. This indicates that when consumers have higher degrees of food neophobia with regard to insect foods, they will not purchase them. This is consistent with the results of Piha et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], La Barbera et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and Tan et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which state that consumers with high degrees of food neophobia are unwilling to try new functional foods [
 <xref rid="B97-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] and this, in turn, reduces purchase intention. But Piha et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggested that differences in cultural regions also affect consumers’ purchasing intention to buy insect food. When consumers know more about edible insect food, they will have a higher willingness to buy it. Food neophobia is also correlated to consumer interest in food [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and can affect consumers’ hedonic assessment of food. Jaeger et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] identified food neophobia as the consumer preference for certain kinds of food, and an important impediment to changing food habits and resolving food-related health problems. As such, resolving consumer food neophobia toward certain types of foods is helpful for improving consumer acceptance of such foods. Per these findings, H1, H3, and H5 are supported but H2 and H4 are not. A summary of the verification of the hypotheses made in this study is shown in
