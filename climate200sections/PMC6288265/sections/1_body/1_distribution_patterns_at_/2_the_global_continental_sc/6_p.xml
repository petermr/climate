Endemics and Mediterranean elements dominate in the south (Iberian, Apennine and Balkan peninsulas), probably because of high mountains raised barriers to northward dispersal, turning into Atlantic and European elements in the western and central Europe, even to more homogeneous, mostly synanthropic and introduced assemblages in northern Europe (Fig.
