 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis et al. (2007)</xref> and Kassara (unpublished) in her diploma thesis (Universities of Crete and Patras 2006), attempted an exploration of distribution data at a global scale for the species included in 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Schmalfuss (2004)</xref>. They used a relatively coarse-grained mapping of distributions, using a regions-by-country digital map of the world, and the information provided in the above-mentioned paper, further refined by checking the primary literature in many cases where the distribution mentioned was very vague. Specific patterns explored were diversity hotspots, latitudinal trends in species richness and Rapoportâ€™s rule (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Stevens 1989</xref>). Unequal sampling biases notwithstanding, these studies found suggestive evidence in favour of increased diversity in regions with Mediterranean-type ecosystems, as well as in insular areas of the tropics (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Whether this is related to allopatric speciation patterns in topographically and/or environmentally heterogeneous sites or to other factors, it remains an open question. Latitudinal gradients of species richness are in agreement with this pattern, showing peaks in both northern and southern mid-latitudes.
