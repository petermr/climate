<p>Available information on terrestrial isopod distribution at a global scale is severely limited, though, due to large inequalities in research activity among different parts of the globe. We do know the general distribution of many species but at a low level of accuracy regarding range limits and site occupancy. During the last decade, at least, there is an increasing trend among isopodologists to provide such detailed information, but we are still very far away from a ‘World atlas of 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="suborder">Oniscidea</named-content>
 </named-content>’. Nevertheless, even the coarse-grained data at hand can lead to some generalisations.
