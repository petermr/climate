<p>Most scenarios of future climate change effects on species distributions indicate a shift towards higher altitudes, especially concerning upper range limits (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Parmesan 2006</xref>), particularly reducing available habitats for species restricted to mountaintops. In the face of the, admittedly restricted, information on isopods, it is not easy to make safe predictions regarding their responses to such changes, given that most species occurring on high elevations do not seem to be particularly stenoecious (i.e., with narrow tolerance regarding the range of ecological parameters). On the other hand, we might see some reduction of the high population densities of these species, especially if these densities prove to be a result of ecological release, so that more balanced communities are to be expected on high elevations. In addition, if the steep fall in isopod diversity above the tree line reported on tropical mountains (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Schmalfuss and Ferrara 1982</xref>) is a general pattern, we might even expect an increase of high-altitudesâ€™ isopod diversity following an upward shift of the tree line. The actual situation, of course, is much more complex, given the interplay of temperature rise with rainfall and humidity patterns all of which also affect isopod distributions.
