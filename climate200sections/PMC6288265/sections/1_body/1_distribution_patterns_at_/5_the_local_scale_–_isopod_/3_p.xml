<p>Another aspect of isopod community structure is the moderate to high levels of nestedness exhibited among associated communities (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Baini et al. 2014</xref>). These, nevertheless, are controlled almost completely by the inclusion of large communities in the data set, while poor communities are more or less heterogeneously structured, reflecting mostly the patchy spatial distribution of habitats. The respective literature on isopods is very restricted, though, but we can cautiously infer that oniscidean communities are principally assembled on the basis of fine-grained, local habitat heterogeneity. Along a related line of study on community assembly, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis et al. (2006)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Pitta et al. (2012)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Baini et al. (2014)</xref> showed that there is no evidence that interspecific competition plays some significant role in isopod community structure, even among congeneric species. Once more, what repeatedly arises as an important factor across scales is the close association between isopod occurrence patterns and habitat structure (see also

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Judas and Hauser 1998</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al. 2008</xref>) suggesting even a role of isopods as indicators of habitat change (e.g.,
