<p>Isopod communities from different parts of the world and a variety of habitat types seem to exhibit low equitability, due to dominance of one, usually widespread and/or, synanthropic species. The identity of this species, of course, may differ per geographical region and/or habitat. In Itapuã State Park, southern Brazil, for example, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Almerão et al. (2006)</xref> found

   <named-content content-type="species">floridana</named-content>

   <named-content content-type="genus">Armadillidium</named-content>
   <named-content content-type="species">vulgare</named-content>
  </named-content>
 </italic> (Latreille) often contributes to this pattern at certain habitat types (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al. 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Tajovský et al. 2012</xref>). The reasons for this commonly found skewness have not been explored in detail. As already stated, this dominance pattern is very pronounced in alpine communities. At lower sites it is less extreme, but still detectable. Nevertheless, seasonal changes in dominance might also be present (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Souty-Grosset et al. 2008</xref>), so the experimental design has to be taken into account before attempting generalisations.
