 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">Sutton and Harding (1989)</xref> provided a more detailed account of British isopodsâ€™ distributions, which was recently updated by 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Gregory (2009)</xref> taking advantage of a large number of occurrence data from Britain and Ireland. These authors showed that there is a slight northwestern to southeastern trend of increasing species richness in both England and Ireland. Despite of this trend, though, they have concluded that the most crucial factor determining species richness is habitat diversity, or better the availability of certain species-rich habitats, which tend to occur at the southeastern parts of these islands. Published work at this scale, though, is not very useful for evaluating responses to environmental factors, as they are rather phenomenological in nature, and/or mostly identify the geographical areas that host favourable habitats for isopods within the respective country or region. A more robust analysis at such a large scale was performed by 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Purse et al. (2012)</xref>, who showed that habitat use at a fine scale is the main driver of isopod species distribution patterns.
