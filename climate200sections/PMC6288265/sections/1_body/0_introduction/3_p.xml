This becomes even more amazing if one also considers that the origin of the taxon is believed to be very old, possibly Palaeozoic (

This fortunate fact offers vast opportunities for comparative studies in a wide range of fields, including physiology, morphology, ecology, behaviour, etc. Biogeography can also profit from this, by comparing modern distribution patterns among species and/or higher taxa with very different adaptive syndromes. Environmental change, such as habitat fragmentation, pollution, climate change, etc., may also exert varying effects on different lineages according to their position along this ‘water to land to extreme terrestrial habitats’ gradient. Furthermore, the study of

 </named-content> distribution may provide crucial insight into processes and patterns pertaining to environmental change also due to the fairly well known general effects of relative humidity and temperature on these animals.
