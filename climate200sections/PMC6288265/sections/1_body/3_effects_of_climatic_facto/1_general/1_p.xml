<p>Detritivore soil invertebrates – among them terrestrial isopods – are responsible for turnover of litter and are effective regulators (litter transformers, ecosystem engineers) of that process (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Lavelle 1997</xref>). The functional role of isopods is a crucial part of the soil food web. Woodlice, even though they can be omnivorous, mainly feed on decaying plant material. They have a vital role in the fragmentation, fungal and bacterial inoculation of dead plant material that is to make organic matter available for other elements of the decomposer network. In spite of the important ecosystem service of macro-detritivores in the belowground life, studies concerning their function are underrepresented in the scientific literature.
