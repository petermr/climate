 </italic> Latreille has been shown to avoid temperatures above 25 °C owing to the danger of increased evaporative water loss. There is a progressive decrease in speed after a weight loss &gt;10 % compared to initial body mass due to desiccation (

 </italic> (Frivaldsky), a cave dwelling isopod (adapted to a constant 93% relative humidity and around 10 °C average temperature in Baradla cave, Hungary) can tolerate gradual temperature changes on a quite broad scale (0–22 °C) but changes in humidity have a lethal effect (
