<p>Climatic changes definitively influence population processes, too. Life history traits such as reproduction (timing, parity, number of potential offspring) are highly influenced by humidity, moisture, and temperature (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">Souty-Grosset et al. 1988</xref>). There are life history parameters which help isopod establishment and range expansion. Successful species, in addition to the omnivore and detritivore feeding habits, have developed several advantageous reproductive strategies, such as parthenogenesis, multivoltine iteroparity, sperm storage, and high offspring number. Under stressful weather conditions individuals can modify their reproductive output (phenotypic plasticity) to increase survival probability (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Hornung and Warburg 1998</xref>). Climate change may influence reproduction through indirect effects, such as food quality (plant growth and quality) (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Rushton and Hassall 1983</xref>). The current climate change trend could affect such traits. Species with wider tolerance limits, higher reproductive output, and with the ability of sperm storage (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki and Ziegler 2005</xref>) have better chances for survival and geographical expansion, and might contribute to the homogenisation of isopod fauna word-wide. Such phenomena have already been documented in urban regions, where habitat generalists and introduced, sometimes even invasive species use the human-made environment as a ‘spring-board’ for successful establishment (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Garthwaite et al. 1995</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Hornung and Szlavecz 2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Tartally et al. 2004</xref>). The process is promoted by human-aided dispersal, repeated introductions, and creation of new, favourable habitats for such species. On the other hand, in species with different life history characteristics, semelparity, univoltine iteroparity, small body and brood size, and habitat specialisation hinder successful dispersal. 
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Sutton et al. (1984)</xref> classified life history variations into two strategies, reminiscent of the extremes in the r–K selection continuum: ‘stenodynamic’, similar to r-selected, and ‘eurydynamic’, similar to K-selected life history strategies.
