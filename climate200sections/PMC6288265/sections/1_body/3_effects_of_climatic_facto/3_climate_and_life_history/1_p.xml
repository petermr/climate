<p>Woodlice, besides physiological and ecomorphological responses, can protect themselves from water loss by behavioural adaptations. They may show varying seasonal and diurnal patterns of activity, increased nocturnal activity and/or vertical and lateral movements towards sites with increased humidity. There is a correlation between precipitation pattern and isopod surface activity. In one study, aboveground abundance was found to increase about one month after the onset of rainy season in the Mediterranean (
