<p>Climate change has always been a trigger for evolution and for changes in the distribution of all species on Earth. Nevertheless, if one of the various scenarios of global climate change presented by IPCC proves to approximate the actual climate of the next few decades, then the speed of the change will not allow for distributional shifts and evolutionary adaptations of most organisms. Different scenarios forecast global temperature and sea-level rise, and more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic phenomena. The extent of climate change effects on different geographical regions, though, is expected to vary widely.</p>
