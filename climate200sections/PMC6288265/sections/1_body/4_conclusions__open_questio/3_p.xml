<p>An important relevant process that, till today, has led to an increased isopod diversity in some regions of the world (e.g., North America, Britain), is the human-caused introduction of alien species (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Coupled with the fact that isopod species do not usually exhibit pronounced interspecific competition, introduction of alien isopod species is not expected to have negative effects on native species, so that the net result will be an increase in species richness. Nevertheless, there are some cases where introduced species may have led to exclusion of natives (Taiti, personal communication). Such effects might be seen also in isolated tropical islands and human-made ‘tropical houses’ after the anthropochorous dispersal of pantropical species, but also in temperate regions where several species have been introduced mainly of European origin. Temperature increase might provide more opportunities for alien introductions. Of course, this process has its negative side too, since we do not yet know the effects of other alien taxa introductions on native isopod species (e.g., possible predators such as spiders or lizards etc., or competitors such as millipedes, detritivore larvae etc.).
