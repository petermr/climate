<p>Attention of most lay people that happen to notice terrestrial isopods is mostly attracted by conglobating species, ‘pill-bugs’, large non-conglobating forms, such as several species of

 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="suborder">Oniscidea</named-content>
 </named-content> can be classified into a small number of forms, which are generally believed to be related to their ecological features. If this is true, then these forms might respond differently to environmental change. In this case, we could study responses at a more inclusive interspecific level beyond taxonomic groups.
