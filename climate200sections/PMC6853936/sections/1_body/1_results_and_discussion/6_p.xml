<p id="Par12">From the 1930s onwards, however, DOC trends in ELA lakes differ from Sudbury lakes, gradually increasing to pre-industrial levels by the 1970s and then exceeding background levels by 11 ± 14% (range: −11.4 to +35.2%) in the 2000s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). If acid deposition was the sole stressor in the ELA, DOC concentrations would have remained suppressed until at least the 1970s. There are no indications of significant land use/cover changes during the 1900s in the ELA, which was established in 1968 in a wilderness area, with some logging in the 1950–1970s. Wildfires occur in the area every 80–120 years, reflected in forest stands of similar age

 </sup>. Other stressors with a potential to elevate DOC levels in the ELA are changes in climate and atmospheric N deposition. Increased N deposition can promote plant growth in N-limited forests, which increases the C pool and thus the potential for DOC leaching
