<p id="Par11">Similar to Sudbury, DOC concentrations were stable in the more remote ELA lakes prior to industrialization but also started to decline during the ~1890s with increasing SO

 <sup>2−</sup> deposition from long-range transport (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The inferred DOC decline also coincides in ELA lakes with the rise of sediment total Pb concentrations, emphasizing the link between acid deposition and changing DOC levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). By the 1920s, DOC concentrations declined on average by 11 ± 6% (range: 0.3–18%) relative to background levels, whereas in Sudbury average DOC values were already 33 ± 15% (range: 16–63%) below background (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), reflecting the higher deposition rates in northeastern Ontario (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the ELA, catchment sensitivity of lakes to acidification (CaMg* = 75–199 µeq L
 <sup>−1</sup>) is comparable to Sudbury lakes, and ranges between those of the acid-sensitive (32–85 µeq L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and well-buffered (242–372 µeq L
 <sup>−1</sup>) Sudbury lakes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).
