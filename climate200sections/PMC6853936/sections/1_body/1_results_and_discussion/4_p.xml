 </sup>. Previous studies have identified two potential physicochemical mechanisms for increasing DOC in response to reductions in acid deposition: a) reduced soil-solution acidity and/or b) reduced soil-solution ionic strength. Reduced acidity decreases the protonation of organic acids (e.g., carboxylic acids), which increases the electrical charge, and consequently the solubility and mobility of soil organic matter, whereas reduced ionic strength, more precisely reduced concentrations of polyvalent cations such as Al
 <sup>3+</sup>, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, decreases the potential for DOC adsorption or coagulation through cation bridging

The similar DOC response in all lakes independent of their individual catchment sensitivities to acidification suggests that changes in soil solution acidity and ionic strength are important for DOC dynamics in the Sudbury region, pointing towards a universal impact of acid deposition on lake-water DOC in both acid-sensitive and well-buffered systems
