<p id="Par8">Lake-water DOC concentrations inferred from the lake sediments are generally overestimated for the study lakes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), but inferred trends closely match trends in monitoring data in both regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Therefore, we focus on discussing overall trends and trajectories of change using our methods

 </sup>. For Sudbury lakes, the DOC reconstructions show homogeneous trends, with stable levels until ~1850, declines beginning in ~1890, reaching their lowest values in the ~1960s, and increasing from the ~1970s/1980s (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Compared to pre-industrial levels, DOC concentrations declined on average by 46 ± 14% (range: 27.6–63.4%) by the 1960s, and were still 29 ± 6% (range: 20.8–40.3%) below background levels by the 2000s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). These dynamics closely mirror temporal changes in acid deposition at the study sites, indicated by coeval changes in sediment total Pb concentrations (a robust proxy for changes in atmospheric pollutant deposition, including sulphur, following industrialization; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and in SO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions for Sudbury and North America overall
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), demonstrating the predominant influence of acid deposition on DOC dynamics in this former high deposition area. DOC concentrations started to decline shortly after the onset of local SO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions following the discovery of nickel-copper sulphides (1883) and the establishment of open roast yards and the first smelters in 1888, and then began to recover in most lakes within two decades after 1970s emissions reductions. Vegetation loss following acid deposition and soil erosion in lake catchments located close to smelters may have contributed to the reduced DOC levels. However, two of the eight Sudbury lakes are located in Killarney Provincial Park, an area with intact vegetation cover ~60 km SW of Sudbury. DOC reconstructions for these lakes show a similar magnitude of change in DOC concentrations, pointing towards the overriding importance of acid deposition on soil DOC solubility/mobility rather than degradation of the terrestrial C pool. This is further corroborated by the ubiquitous measured DOC increases across the Sudbury region that include lakes with minimal catchment disturbances located far outside (up to 100 km) of the vegetation damage zone close to Sudbury smelters

 </sup>. Elevated DOC levels in some lakes around 1870 coincide with initial logging activities in the area, which may have increased DOC leaching from forest soils over the short term
