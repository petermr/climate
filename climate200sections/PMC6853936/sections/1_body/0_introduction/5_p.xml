<p id="Par6">We reconstructed past lake-water DOC trends using high-resolution 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb-dated sediment cores from 16 lakes, with eight each from Sudbury and the ELA, to identify regional DOC trends for the past ~200 years, and to determine: a) to what extent and on what timescale DOC levels have declined in response to acid deposition; b) to what degree DOC concentrations have recovered since sulphur emissions reductions; and c) how DOC levels might change in the future during continuing recovery, and in response to climate change-driven warming temperatures and changes in precipitation.
