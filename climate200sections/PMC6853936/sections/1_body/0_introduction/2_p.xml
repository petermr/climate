 </sup>, can influence lake-water DOC levels, an increasing number of studies have attributed the DOC increase to the recovery of soils from atmospheric acid deposition, which enhances DOC solubility and thus its mobility from terrestrial to aquatic environments. For example, water-monitoring data have shown strong temporal correlations between changes in water chemistry resulting from reduced acid deposition (declining sulphate and ionic strength, increasing pH) and increasing DOC concentrations

 </sup>. However, the concurrent impacts of the different stressors complicate identifying their individual contributions to changes in DOC, and the lack of long-term data beyond traditional monitoring windows (a few decades at best) leaves it unclear whether the ongoing browning is unprecedented or predominantly a “re-browning” to natural pre-industrial levels.
