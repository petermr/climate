<p id="Par2">Monitoring programs across northern Europe and northeastern North America have recorded a marked “browning” (also referred to as “brownification”) of inland waters in recent decades, caused by increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. The DOC and associated water-colour increases affect water quality, increase costs for drinking water treatment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, and may alter the overall functioning of aquatic ecosystems because DOC concentrations influence physical and chemical water properties, and thus the structure and productivity of biological communities. For example, DOC affects light attenuation, oxygen and nutrient availability, and consequently the development of thermal stratification and hypoxia as well as species distributions and habitat availability
