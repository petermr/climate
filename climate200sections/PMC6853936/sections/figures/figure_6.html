 <caption> Changes in lake-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compared to different lake acidification histories, demonstrating the near-immediate response in DOC levels to changes in atmospheric acid deposition independent of lake-water acidification. Open squares (pH) and black circles (DOC) represent sediment-inferred trends, while red squares represent pH monitoring data. Historical pH trends were inferred for five of the eight Sudbury lakes in prior studies using diatom-based pH models 34, 58â€“ 60 . </caption>
