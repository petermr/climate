 <p>This research is part of the Landscape Carbon Accumulation through Reductions in Emissions (L-CARE) project. We thank Professor Richard Bindler for support with Pb measurements, Michael Paterson and Scott Higgins at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) for provision of water chemistry, climate and deposition chemistry data for the ELA, and Jocelyne Heneberry and Brie Edwards at the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks for water chemistry monitoring data for Sudbury and Killarney lakes. We also thank Andrew L. Labaj, Amy E. Tropea, Brendan Wiltse, Adam Jeziorski and Kathleen R. Laird for providing data for the study lakes, and Christopher Grooms for coordinating many of the lab analyses. We acknowledge Environment and Climate Change Canada for the provision of precipitation chemistry data from: 1) the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) and several provincial networks, accessed from the Government of Canada Open Government Portal at open.canada.ca, and 2) the United States National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene, 465 Henry Mall, Madison, WI 53706, accessed at http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/data/. Financial support was provided by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet; Grant No. 2016-00573), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Ontario Centres of Excellence.
