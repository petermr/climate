<p>The scaling up of international commitment on noncommunicable diseases over the past decade had initially focused on four risk factors: tobacco use, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Exposure to each of these risks has a strong element of personal choice, with the responsibility often placed on individual rather than on broader societal responses. However, these risks are also strongly affected by social determinants, including commodity prices, production methods, marketing and social norms, and in the case of activity levels, the physical environment. A range of other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases are even more strongly linked to environmental exposures â€“ and to climate change. </p>
