<p id="p0260">In this study, similar qualitative patterns were observed on both farms, although differences in FECs between high and low EBV ewes at times of peak egg output on Farm 1 were more elusive. There was a statistically significant difference between the distributions of low and high EBV ewe mean FECs and maximum FECs on Farm 2, but not Farm 1. Similarly, the 
 <italic>P</italic> values estimated by Monte Carlo simulation tended to be higher than the traditional acceptance threshold of 0.05 on Farm 1. This is reflected in the overlapping distributions of FECs in high and low EBV ewes. This is, to an extent, expected given the tendency for negative binomial parasite distributions within host populations. However, this could also be due to the lower sample size, narrower range of EBVs, and especially the looser inclusion criteria for the observed group on Farm 1, with ewes not managed in groups of similar age or number of lambs born, due to limited availability of ewes. Higher variability between ewes in factors affecting FECs during the PPR, such as individual fitness, nutrition or infection rate, or the resource demands of variable numbers of lambs, is likely to decrease the power of statistical comparisons between groups, and confound results. It is recommended that future studies, as far as possible, match ewes on potentially important criteria such as number of lambs, in order to increase study power. Effects of genetic resistance to nematode infection act through enhanced acquired natural immunity, and are likely to be most evident in relation to less resistant animals when infection pressure and nutritional stress are both high (
