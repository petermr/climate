In the present study, the reduced FEC in low EBV ewes was not associated with any sacrifice in production in terms of lamb growth or ewe weight loss. However, the sample size was relatively small compared with other studies that have reported such an association. For example, using a dataset of over 1400 FECs from more than 400 ewes, 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear (2001)</xref> observed a positive genetic correlation of 0.24 between Scottish Blackface ewe FECs and 4â€¯week weights of lambs, which may indicate a trade-off between milk production and resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes.
