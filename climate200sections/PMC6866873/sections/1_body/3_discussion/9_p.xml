<p id="p0235">In this study, the high and low EBV ewes and their lambs were grazed on the same paddocks on both farms and shared a common environment. Therefore, the overall exposure to infection was similar for all lambs and the lambs born to high EBV ewes benefitted from the reduced FEC of co-grazing low EBV ewes. Given the negative association between worm burden and daily live weight gain (
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Mavrot et al., 2015</xref>), selecting for low EBV ewes to improve resistance across the entire flock could theoretically result in 8â€¯week weights greater than observed in this study, as exposure to infective larvae would be reduced, in line with the model predictions presented here.
