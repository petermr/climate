<p id="p0200">Ewes on two commercial farms were evaluated for resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infection as ewe lambs as part of a breed improvement programme, using EBVs based on FECs, and monitored after lambing to assess the impact of genetic status on nematode egg output during this critical period, when egg counts typically show a transient rise (the PPR). The impact of an attenuated PPR on the simulated exposure of lambs to infection arising from eggs excreted by ewes during the peri-parturient period, and the potential for resistant ewes to reduce future impacts of climate change on infection pressure, was simulated.</p>
