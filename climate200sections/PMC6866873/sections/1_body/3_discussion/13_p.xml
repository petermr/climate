It is therefore recommended that field trials evaluating novel approaches to gastrointestinal nematode control are designed with this uncertainty in mind and that longitudinal, multi-year trials are attempted where possible. The model presented here can help to design efficient field trials, by exploring different scenarios in more detail and selecting key areas for empirical confirmation.
