 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Gaba et al., 2006</xref>) the observed decrease in egg output by ewes in the low EBV group compared with the high EBV group, and the simulated fate of these eggs throughout the grazing season, could result in 826 and 1778 fewer adult worms in lambs on Farms 1 and 2, respectively, in the period between lambing and weaning. Therefore, the observed reduction in FECs in this study, and simulated reduction in pasture contamination, could result in meaningful reductions in subsequent pasture contamination by lambs, and substantially lower nematode burdens by the end of the grazing season. For example, a 4 year study of set-stocked groups of ‘resistant’ and ‘susceptible’ rams demonstrated that pasture contamination was significantly reduced, as confirmed using tracer lambs, and that worm burden was reduced by 99% in the ‘resistant’ group compared with the ‘susceptible’ group (
