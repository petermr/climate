<p id="p0245">Breeding for resistance shows considerable potential to mitigate the impact of climate change and offers a sustainable alternative to chemical interventions. Furthermore, the predicted benefit of breeding for nematode resistance in the maternal line is relevant to other novel approaches to gastrointestinal nematode control that achieve similar reductions in FECs. For example, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Nisbet et al. (2016)</xref> achieved a 45% decrease in egg output during the peri-parturient period in ewes vaccinated against 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic>. Notably, the observed decrease in egg output achieved by vaccination is greater than the average decrease achieved in the present study through selective breeding. Despite the relatively smaller reduction in FECs in the present study, the predicted benefits of this reduction in the context of reduced pasture contamination and reduced lamb exposure to infection lend support to the future role of vaccination in controlling gastrointestinal nematodes. Selective breeding might also enhance vaccine effectiveness in the field, as indicated by breed differences in responsiveness to a 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> vaccine (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>).
