 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Significant differences were observed in week 5 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.036) and week 7 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.061; tending towards statistical significance) on Farm 2, although not on Farm 1. Bootstrapped peak FECs were 30% and 37% lower in low EBV ewes compared with high EBV ewes on Farms 1 and 2, respectively (
