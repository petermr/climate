<p id="p0170">On Farm 2, for which ewe and lamb live-weight data were available (Supplementary Table S3), ewes lost an average of 6.27 kg (±S.D. 5.12 kg) between lambing and weaning (reducing from 56.8 2 kg (±S.D. 4.58 kg) to 50.55 kg (±S.D. 6.00 kg)). Ewe weight loss tended to be higher in ewes that produced higher maximum FECs, though there was substantial unexplained variability (
