<p id="p0180">Using the observed FECs for low and high EBV ewes on Farms 1 and 2 as input, together with historic climatic data and predicted lamb herbage intake, lamb exposure to 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> infection was simulated. The observed 23% reduction in FEC in low EBV groups compared with high EBV ewes on Farm 1 translated to a similar simulated reduction in lamb exposure of 22% in the period between lambing and weaning, and over the course of the grazing season. Similarly, the observed 34% reduction in ewe FECs on Farm 2 translated to a simulated reduction in lamb exposure of 41% in the period between lambing and weaning, and 39% over the course of the grazing season (
