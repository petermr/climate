Additional model simulations were therefore run to explore the potential for the reduced PPR in FECs in resistant ewes to mitigate increased infection pressure under climate change, under the assumption that the nematodes would not adapt their thermal niche to the changing climate within this timeframe. Simulating the reduced PPR in resistant ewes considers lambsâ€™ exposure to infection originating from ewes during the peri-parturient period, such as in management systems where ewes are removed from the lambs at weaning but lambs remain on the contaminated pasture.
