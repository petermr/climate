<p id="p0125">Eight factor combinations were simulated in a 2
 <sup>3</sup> factorial design considering the nematode species (
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> and 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>), host resistance status (susceptible and resistant), and climate (historic and future high emissions scenario). Although 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> is currently more common in the study area than 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>, simulations suggest increasing 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> in northern Europe in future (
