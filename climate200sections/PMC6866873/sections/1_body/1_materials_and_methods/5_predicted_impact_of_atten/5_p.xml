<p id="p0110">From the model output, hypothetical exposure of lambs to infection by L3h contributed by high EBV and low EBV ewes on both farms were estimated for the period between birth to weaning, and between birth to slaughter at the end of the grazing season (assuming lambs remained on the lambing paddocks for the duration). For this, L3h kg DM
 <sup>−1</sup>(dry matter) ha
 <sup>−1</sup> was estimated using the L3h ha
 <sup>−1</sup> (

 <italic>B</italic>) of 2000 kg DM ha
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Kao et al., 2000</xref>). This was then multiplied by the predicted herbage dry matter intake (DMI), which was assumed to increase from 0 kg DM day
 <sup>−1</sup> at birth to 1.2 kg DM day
 <sup>−1</sup> at weaning (
