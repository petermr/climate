<p id="p0105">Model input also required the number of eggs deposited on pasture per hectare, per day, between lambing and weaning, which was estimated as the daily mean group FEC for the high and low EBV ewes, respectively, multiplied by a representative stocking rate of five ewes per hectare (ha) and 2000â€¯g of faeces produced daily (

 <italic>approxfun</italic> function in R, to estimate daily group FEC values. Ewe FEC input after weaning was reduced to 0 to simulate removal of ewes from the pasture. Model simulations track the fate of these eggs excreted by ewes during the PPR in FECs (i.e. egg development and mortality, and larvae development, mortality and migration onto herbage) and provide daily estimates of the number of infective larvae on herbage (L3h) per unit area (per hectare in the present study).
