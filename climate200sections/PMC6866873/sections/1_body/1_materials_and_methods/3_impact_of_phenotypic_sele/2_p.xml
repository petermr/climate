<p id="p0080">The relationship between the FEC-EBV estimated at 5–6 months of age and observed FEC in individual ewes around lambing was assessed by a Spearman rank correlation, using the peak FEC per ewe, and average FEC per ewe over all sampling occasions. One-way Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to these mean and peak FECs for ewes in low and high EBV groups to determine whether these observed FECs were drawn from the same distribution.</p>
