On Farm 2, monitored ewes were all of similar age (2 or 3â€¯years), and gave birth to twins (with the exception of one triplet-bearing ewe). This restriction was intended to reduce variation in FEC due to, inter alia, unequal resource allocation trade-offs among ewes feeding different numbers of lambs, which could modify the expression of immunity and hence FEC during the PPR (
