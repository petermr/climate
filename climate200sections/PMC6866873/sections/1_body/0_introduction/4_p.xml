<p id="p0040">Ewes are known to increase nematode egg shedding in faeces during the peri-parturient period, around the time of lambing. This peri-parturient rise (PPR) in FECs provides an important source of eggs to contaminate pastures and increase subsequent infection pressure for lambs. Many farms treat ewes around the time of lambing to minimise contamination of lambing paddocks. Due to the contribution of the eggs produced during the PPR to the nematode population infecting lambs each grazing season, however, there are concerns that this strategy may select heavily for drug-resistant nematodes (

Selective breeding of ewes for attenuated PPR could reduce the need to treat ewes and lambs, and play an important role in slowing the development of anthelmintic resistance. These benefits are unlikely to be realised by focusing uniquely on terminal sire breeds in cross-bred meat lamb production systems, since it is the maternal line that generates early season pasture contamination.
