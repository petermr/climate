<p id="p0045">Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) are used by commercial breeders to select for desirable traits as they take into account the effects of genotype and environment on the observed phenotype (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Mrode and Thompson, 2005</xref>). Hence, this approach offers a practical method for genetic improvement within breeds where the breeding population available for selection is maintained across multiple management groups and farms (i.e. environments). For gastrointestinal nematode infection, EBVs are evaluated using FECs from lambs &gt;18â€¯weeks of age, although an IgA saliva test is under development (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2012</xref>). The value of EBV assigned to ewe lambs is unknown in terms of reducing future PPR. In addition, it is unclear whether enhanced immunity to nematodes following lambing could carry costs in terms of milk output or ewe weight loss. This is a risk since the energy and protein costs of immunity may trade off against those of growth and reproduction (

 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Rauw, 2012</xref>). Selecting for resistance to nematodes might also trade off against an ability to resist other parasites and pathogens (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Ezenwa et al., 2010</xref>). Improved understanding of the relationship between EBV for nematode FEC and the PPR could help to define targets for selective breeding, and quantify the expected epidemiological benefits of selective breeding strategies through reduced early season pasture contamination.
