<p id="p0050">A potential limitation to the strategy of breed improvement for parasite resistance is that it takes many years to attain goals, yet is necessarily tied to performance under current environmental and management conditions. Where the epidemiological situation is changing, as for gastrointestinal nematodes under climate warming (
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Wall, 2009</xref>), current breeding efforts might not be well matched to future conditions. Epidemiological models developed for gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep predict changes in both the magnitude and seasonal patterns of challenge as a function of temperature and rainfall (
