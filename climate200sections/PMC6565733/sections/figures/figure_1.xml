  <p>The diagram illustrates the four phases to develop the ACCVI framework. Phase 1 includes data collection and semi-structured interviews with decision makers, a systematic literature review translated into a multiplex network analysis model, inclusion criteria, and the use of buffer areas of 100-km to assess communities at local and regional scales. Phase 2 calculates exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices while hierarchizing variables. Phase 3 involves the final index calculation by applying map algebra techniques to combine indices. This phase was calibrated with two model types and two vulnerability equations. In the figure and throughout the article are only shown best calibration results symbolized by model Type I model and the Multiplicative Equation. Calculation results includes baseline and future IPCC RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for aviation and marine sectors, dissected into four climate components (rain, snow, summer-winter temperatures) and sea level rise projections. In Phase 4, three types of results were produced: (
   <bold>a</bold>) exposure, where climate and biophysical variables are calculated; (
   <bold>b</bold>) vulnerability, where exposure results are combined using the vulnerability equation which incorporate socioeconomic dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for both aviation and marine sectors; (
   <bold>c</bold>) increment change, where final vulnerability index results are represented as fractional changes
