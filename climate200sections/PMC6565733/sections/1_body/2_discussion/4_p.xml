<p id="Par19">Finally, it is important to note that vulnerability indexes are approximate methods of explaining how much a given system can be impacted by an external threat. In climate change science, the cause and effect between threats (exposure vector) and the end product (vulnerability) is a non-linearity. This non-linear relationship is produced by a condition that leads the system to a destabilizing threshold point which ultimately affects the entire system interrelationships. Such relationships between vulnerability drivers are so complex that is practically impossible to formulate indices that can unequivocally measure the vulnerability of a system (with progressive difficulty towards large areas)

 </sup>. There are also indirect hazards, such as an oil spill’s impact on local food security, that were not specifically assessed or captured in the model. These indirect vulnerabilities are highly important, and while select variables, such as emergency response capacity and adaptive capacity, have wide implications, additional research is needed to more fully incorporate indirect scenarios accurately into models.
