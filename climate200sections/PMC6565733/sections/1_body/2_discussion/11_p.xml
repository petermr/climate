<p id="Par26">In such cases, first, it is essential that vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans look at various spatial scales to target at-risk populations. We highlight wide variation in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity across Inuit Nunangat. While we did not assess intra-community variation, there is likely high variation between households. Adaptation planning should reflect various scales of needs and vulnerability. Second, emergency managers and public health officials should prepare for increasing probabilities of small and large disasters due to climate change, shifts in marine traffic, and changing demographics. Emergency and disaster response across the Canadian Arctic is limited by a lack of interagency training, a lack of community-based resources, knowledge, preparedness, and minimal resources beyond DND capacities

 </sup>. Capacity could be built through additional multi-agency training for both small (multi-day power plant failure) and large (airplane crash) incidents. Improvements in airport infrastructure where runways are too short for CC-130 or C17 to land and where instrument minimums frequently limit aeromedical access is essential to improving response.
