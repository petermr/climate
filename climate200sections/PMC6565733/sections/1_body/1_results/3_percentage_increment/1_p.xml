<p id="Par15">The percentage increment/anomalies analysis captures fractional changes more clearly within vulnerability calculations (see methods for details), identifying regions and communities with the highest percent of change in future vulnerability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Sea level rise for the marine sector is projected to have the highest percent change (100%), followed by rain and winter temperatures (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Increments are estimated to be higher for Nunatsiavut (70%) and Nunavik regions (62%) particularly in major centers throughout Inuit Nunangat (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>) such as: Iqaluit (high exposure), Kuujjuaq (presently low modeled adaptive capacity), and Inuvik (presently high modeled marine sensitivity). This indicates that current socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure constrain the ability to cope with future climatic exposures.
