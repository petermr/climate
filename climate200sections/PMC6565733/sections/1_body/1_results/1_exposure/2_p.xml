<p id="Par10">Among the assessed hazards, current exposure for summer-winter temperatures and rain have the widest distribution of exposure values (close to 1) when compared to other hazards (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for all models). Future exposure scenarios indicate that summer-winter temperatures and rain models surpass the 0–1 index window (indicating an extreme future climate). In general, the models agree that exposure will increase towards the end of the century for rain, temperatures and sea level rise across the Arctic Archipelago and North Atlantic. While both winter-summer temperatures will increase most in more southerly communities, rain and snow exposure is projected to increase the most in eastern Inuit Nunangat. Nunavik and Nunatsiavut are projected to be most exposed under the rain model (see rain model example Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref> and other hazards in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The three communities that were most commonly high ranked for exposure are Makkovik, Rigolet, and Hopedale.
