 </sup>. Secondly, a significant body of case study research has developed over the last decade, focusing on complex interactions between climate change and society in specific locations, and have been described as bottom up as they focus on locally identified and relevant conditions

These approaches provide rich detail but are often too context specific for informing decision making and lack a quantitative basis for incorporating climate projections to develop future vulnerability scenarios. This disconnect between top down and bottom up approaches, rooted in different disciplinary perspectives, presents a persistent stumbling block for developing credible future vulnerability scenarios
