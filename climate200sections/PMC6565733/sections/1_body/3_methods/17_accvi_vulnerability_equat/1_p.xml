<p id="Par66">The additive Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="">9</xref> is a raw version of the original vulnerability equation which defines how vulnerability is numerically calculated (as described in Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ8" ref-type="">8</xref> is a multiplicative version of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="">9</xref> which has been used in similar frameworks assessing climate change vulnerability indices at large scales

 </sup>. The multiplicative version assumes that exposure and sensitivity create an impact, and one unit of this impact can be offset by one unit of adaptive capacity.
