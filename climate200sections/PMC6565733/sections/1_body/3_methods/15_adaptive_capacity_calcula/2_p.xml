<p id="Par59">Developed by INAC, the CWI uses Statistics Canada census data to score communities based on socio-economic wellbeing, education attainment, labor force activities, income, and housing. Aggregated 2011 CWI scores were used in this study as the 2016 CWI had not yet been published by INAC. The CWI score was missing for 3 communities, which were given the mean regional score. The average CWI score across the region was 61, while the standard deviation was 11.7. Iqaluit had the highest CWI score, while Naujaat had the lowest reported CWI score.</p>
