<p id="Par32">Results from the ACCVI model include both projected gross relative changes (gross value) in vulnerability from baseline to future scenario, as well as the relative increase in vulnerability (increment results). Both model outputs are insightful and contribute to a more holistic understanding of projected vulnerability change (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Since results are relative values, they must be interpreted by compared values among communities and regions or over time under a given model.
