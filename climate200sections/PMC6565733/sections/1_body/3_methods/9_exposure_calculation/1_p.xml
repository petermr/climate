<p id="Par45">Exposure indices were used to project characteristics of climate change that may influence future vulnerability in the Canadian Arctic. We selected three climate variables (rain, snow and temperature winter-summer) that are known to be changing in magnitude or frequency–examined through mean values and extreme indices (Supplementary Note

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These weather variables play a role in infrastructure exposure and potentially affect vulnerability. As an example, precipitation and winds may cause low visibility and navigability for aviation or permafrost changes and snow accumulation may impact airport operations. We also included projected sea level rise data to develop a sea level rise vulnerability model
