 <caption> Correlating variance in Austral Summer (December-January-February) and Winter (June-July-August) precipitation during period of highest Mid-Holocene instability (8.4–7.9 k cal BP) and tropical versus extra-tropical demographic patterns. Top: Maps are based on 11 simulated grids of the TRaCE-21ka experiment in 50-year time steps in 50-year intervals. Grid cell resolution of the circulation model is 2.5°, projected to Albers Equal Area Conic for South America. The Southern Cone displays the overall lowest variance in precipitation over the mid-Holocene in both summer and winter. Bottom: Inverse demographic trends in the tropical highlands and lowlands during the Middle Holocene. </caption>
