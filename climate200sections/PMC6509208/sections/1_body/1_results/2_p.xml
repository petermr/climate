<p id="Par7">The next set of analyses aims to identify spatial variability in demographic dynamics associated to the middle Holocene. Disaggregating the archaeological 
 <sup>14</sup>C record into three regions formally describes significant variation in the distribution and intensity of demographic downturns, underscoring that the impacts of climatic variability are themselves variable in space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Negative and positive deviations in the permutation tests reflect periods where subsets of the data significantly exceed the overall continental trend

 </sup>, indirectly confirming the existence of a continent-wide decline starting at ~8.6 k cal BP. It is important to note the reason for conformity between the summed probability distributions around 8.2 k cal BP. We find a lack of significant downturn in relation to the overall trend in the continental dataset consistent with the South America-wide downturn identified separately (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As indicated by the null model test, the entire modelling domain is experiencing a demographic contraction at this time, which masks the statistical distinctiveness of coeval downturns in subsets of the data. The absence of a significant negative signal at this time in this test is therefore to be expected.
