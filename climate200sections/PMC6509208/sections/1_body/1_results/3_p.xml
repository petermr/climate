<p id="Par8">Together, the permutation tests reveal a staggered temporal structure in the summed probability distributions over the mid-Holocene chron. The tropical Highlands and Lowlands trends both show significant yet out of phase negative deviations from the continental confidence envelope. The Highlands appear responsive to heightened aridity around ~6 k and ~5 k cal BP, while declines in the Lowlands appear around 7 k cal BP. Inverse demographic trends exist between the Lowlands and Southern Cone at this time and between the Highlands and Southern Cone around 6 k cal BP. We observe that the most sustained local deviations in the Highland and Southern Cone data occur after 6 k cal BP, albeit opposite trends (negative and positive, respectively), while the Lowlands experiences only centennial-scale negative deviations. Pairwise regional comparisons with permutation tests (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) concordantly show that the tropical Lowland and Highland SPDs return non-significant p-values, indicating statistical similarity, while both are significantly different from the Southern Cone. Together, our results indicate that a common mechanism may have influenced tropical South America, separately from the subtropical and temperate biomes of the Southern Cone. To this effect, we note significantly higher relative population in this region already by 7.5 k cal BP and repeatedly thereafter, with none of the negative phases experienced elsewhere.
