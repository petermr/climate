<p id="Par20">The statistical modelling presented here principally concerns the mid-Holocene, but we carry out our analyses on dates in the interval 12–2 k cal BP. Dates pre-dating 12 k 
 <sup>14</sup>C years BP were excluded, as were those with Gaussian errors of &gt;200 years. Although the initial peopling of South America was underway by 14 k cal BP, and possibly earlier
 <sup>

 </sup>, the sparse evidence available for this period and its distance from the mid-Holocene makes it less germane to this study. Our initial analyses on the 5450 radiocarbon determinations acquired for the entire continent employ the following protocol:

    <italic>Calibration</italic>. Radiocarbon dates are calibrated and aggregated by site into non-overlapping phases over the period 12–2 k 
    <sup>14</sup>C BP, and we report on the results from a focused time range of 9 k – 3 k cal BP. Aggregation of dates from the same site into bins of 200 years is carried out to account for the overrepresentation of well-dated sites. We principally make use of the SHCal13 curve
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
    </sup> for calibration (Fig. 
    <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), except for determinations on marine shells, for which the Marine13 curve
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
    </sup> is used. This calibration curve is offset from the terrestrial curves by several centuries to account for the incorporation of ancient carbon from ocean upwelling into mollusc exoskeletons. In addition, we calibrate marine dates using local averaged ΔR offsets and errors by interpolating to the geographically-closest sampling site, acquired through an online repository

    <italic>Summation</italic>. The probability distributions of the calibrated dates are summed for the entire South American continent. We do not normalise the post-calibration probability distributions, to reduce the effect of peaks and plateaus in the calibration curves on the shape of the final SPDs

    <italic>Model testing</italic>. We initially test the South America-wide SPD against a simple fitted exponential population growth trend. Our choice is guided by an information criterion indicating maximum goodness-of-fit with this model over linear and logistic growth models (Sensitivity Analysis). A sample of calendar dates equal to the number of bins are drawn from the fitted model, converted to 
    <sup>14</sup>C dates, re-calibrated, and their probability distributions summed. We opt to draw from the uncalibrated date distribution. Errors for the re-calibration were generated by sampling with replacement from the empirical 
    <sup>14</sup>C errors of both marine and terrestrial dates
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>

    </sup>, from which 95% confidence intervals are derived. The empirical SPDs were directly compared with the pan-regional trend produced from permuting the marks of the full dataset (n = 5450). We also performed pairwise comparisons of each of the three regions (Fig.
