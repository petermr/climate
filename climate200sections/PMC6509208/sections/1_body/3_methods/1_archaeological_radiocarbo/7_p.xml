 </sup> is most likely to have occurred at 8.6 k cal BP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), providing a point of departure for investigating the degree to which mid-Holocene demographic trends diverge from prior patterns. That is, instead of a single null hypothesis for 12–2 k cal BP, we condition our new null model on the period 12–8.6 k cal BP to satisfactorily identify the degree of deviation after this point in time.
