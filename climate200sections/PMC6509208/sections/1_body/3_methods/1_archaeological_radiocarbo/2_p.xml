<p id="Par17">We make use of the R package ‘rcarbon 1.2’
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup> to perform statistical analyses on our data. Following established frameworks for the aggregate analysis of archaeological 
 <sup>14</sup>C, we examine summed probability distributions (SPDs) of calibrated radiocarbon dates as a proxy for relative change in population over time. This approach to archaeological radiocarbon data rests on the assumption that higher past populations deposit more archaeological material to date, in turn resulting in the production of radiocarbon determinations commensurate with ancient demography

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>, i.e. an assumption of monotony between dated archaeological charcoal and past population levels. Sampling bias, time-dependent and spatially variable taphonomic loss, laboratory errors, calibration curve fluctuations, and sample contamination can potentially introduce systematic errors that obscure or exacerbate genuine demographic signals in the 
 <sup>14</sup>C record. Our mitigation measures for these issues are described in detail in the Supplementary Information. Deletion and loss of archaeological sites is unlikely to have operated on spatiotemporal scale sufficient to bias the record of an entire continent consistently

 <sup>14</sup>C data to be broadly representative despite expectations of some localised site loss.
