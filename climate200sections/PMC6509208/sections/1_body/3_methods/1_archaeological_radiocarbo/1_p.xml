<p id="Par16">Our analysis employs a database of archaeological radiocarbon determinations compiled from a continuous and ongoing survey of the published academic and grey literature, with an especial focus on Amazonia. Our own collection is cross-referenced to large pre-existing databases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup> and corrected with reference to the original published sources. Our data collection resulted in a set of 5450 radiocarbon determinations for the interval 12 k – 2 k 
 <sup>14</sup>C years before present. In contrast to previous compilations over this period
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, we furnish a much larger sample of radiocarbon dates for Amazonia and circum-Amazonia, providing better control over this area.
