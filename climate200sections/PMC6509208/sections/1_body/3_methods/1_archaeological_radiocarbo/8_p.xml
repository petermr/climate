<p id="Par27">Our protocols allow us to examine salient features of the South American radiocarbon record, specifically: (a) the degree and significance of deviation in demographic trends from the null hypothesis of steadily increasing population throughout the Early Holocene in our domain, and (b) the similarity of population trajectories in each regional setting. Both sets of tests permit local and global tests of significance to be estimated, and regional population histories to be compared through z-transformation of the empirical and simulated SPDs

 </sup>. We plot the null models against the empirical SPDs with a running average over a century applied to smooth out artefacts of the calibration process in the probability distributions.
