<p>Previous studies have provided valuable information on the role of biodiversity in the provision of ecosystem service from a theoretical perspective, ranging from the relationship between functional traits and ecosystem services to the pathway that how biodiversity influences ecosystem functions and their ability to provide ecosystem services.

Our results would examine whether habitat management involving manipulation of vegetation can be used to offset the adverse impacts of changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme climatic events on biodiversity. To minimize global biodiversity loss, researchers and habitat managers need to improve their understanding of the biological effects of climate and LUCC, and how these effects can be mitigated through management interventions. Ecological responses to climate change and LUCC are challenging and not always easy to detect, not least because the responses of organisms may vary among species or functional groups,
