<p>Biodiversity faces growing pressures from global changes, including climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, and pollution.

 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Land‚Äêuse/cover change (LUCC) plays an important role in the climate system, ranging from the regional scale to the global scale.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> LUCC is affecting every biome on Earth and contributing to biodiversity loss. Correa et al.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> found that direct and indirect LUCC are major pressures negatively impacting biodiversity through biofuel production, particularly when ecosystems with high biodiversity values (e.g., tropical and subtropical forests and native grasslands) are transformed into biofuel plantations. As the impacts of climate change and LUCC intensify and interact in the coming decades, the threats to biodiversity may be amplified, thereby increasing rates of population decline and extinction risk.
