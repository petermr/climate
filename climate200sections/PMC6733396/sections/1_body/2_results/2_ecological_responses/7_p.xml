<p>The process of land‚Äêuse conversion is usually accompanied by habitat fragmentation, which may affect ecosystem function by decreasing patch size or lengthen distance between patches.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> At the ecosystem scale, increasing the size or number of patches may improve resilience by increasing the effective size of populations and decreasing edge effects. In ecosystems with extensive fragmented areas, patch size and isolation effects will intensify the effect of habitat loss. Consequently, the loss of species or decline in population size will be greater than expected from habitat loss alone. In such a situation, larger patches and more connectivity may be required to maintain populations.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> The existence of a species in a patch depends on the patch size and connectivity between different patches, as well as the adjacent habitat. When neighboring habitats help create new patches, the diversity of total species in a given ecosystem may increase because new species may be found in these new habitats. Habitat generalists can survive in very small patches because they can also utilize resources in the surroundings.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> In summary, the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity are diverse and significant, with different ways of measuring these effects and thereby drawing various conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects.
