<p>Compared with climate change, the future effects of LUCC on biodiversity are receiving less attention. Yet LUCC has a huge impact on agricultural production, greenhouse gases, recreation, urban green spaces, and species diversity.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> With climate change, species show adaptive responses to complex land‚Äêuse scenarios. LUCC has been used as a basis for forecasting future changes in suitable habitats, detecting future invasive species, estimating potential future extinctions in biodiversity hotspots, and highlighting the restricted potential for future expansion of protected areas worldwide.
