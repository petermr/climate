<p>In recent years, the responses of species to climate change have received increasing attention at local, regional, and global scales.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Biodiversity is often influenced by climatic variations including changes in temperature, precipitation, evaporation, radiant flux, carbon emissions, and the increasingly frequent extreme climatic events. As climate continues to change at an increasing rate, species and ecosystems can be expected to respond accordingly, though their response depends on multiple factors from species, community, and ecosystem levels.
