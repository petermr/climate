<p>At the species level, the most common response to LUCC is increasing extinction rates, so conservation actions need to be prioritized based on species' extinction risk. Species with long generation times and populations near their extinction threshold are most likely to have an extinction debt,

 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> assessed the magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis relative to past crises by extrapolating extinction rates. Usually, dominant species in a habitat are considered to be at low extinction risk, and species with poor ability to adapt are more likely to become threatened or even extinct when the area available is reduced by habitat destruction. As a consequence, efforts to slow the rate of habitat loss have focused foremost on rarer species, which, by definition, face the greatest extinction threats.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Species at higher trophic levels are more susceptible to extinction resulting from habitat fragmentation and severe disturbances. If future locations of land use do not coincide with other essential resources like soil type and food resources, extinction risks might be higher than projected.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Responses by individual species to environmental changes are not isolated, but take place in the context of communities and ecosystems that provide nutrients for growth and reproduction. Increased nutrient deposition as a consequence of land‐use change alters soil fertility and may have positive indirect effects on soil biota by improving the quality of resources that plants return to the soil. The plant nutrient cycling and nutrient supply processes generally drive short‐term temporal dynamics of soil biota.
