<p>LUCC accounts for 12.5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref> Related land‐use variables such as changing vegetation types, enhanced rates of decomposition, and substantial losses of forest are closely linked to rising CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations. Complex changes related to carbon emissions have included extensive changes in the quantity, structure, and spatial pattern of land‐use types, particularly in the soil food web. The intensity of land use exerts a significant direct impact on soils, and they are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activities such as acid deposition and heavy metal pollution.
