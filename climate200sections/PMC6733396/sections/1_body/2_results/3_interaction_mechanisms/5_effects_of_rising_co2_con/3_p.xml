<p>In coastal marine systems, early life stages of marine organisms are potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global climate change. Identifying general patterns across species and response variables is challenging,

In the long run, the anticipated acidification of the oceans could be expected to have severe negative impacts on many marine invertebrates and algae. Considering that the expected pH drop may be unprecedented, deeper studies on the biotic effects of pH change are urgently needed.
