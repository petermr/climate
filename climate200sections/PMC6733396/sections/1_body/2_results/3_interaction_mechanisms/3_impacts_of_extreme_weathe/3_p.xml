<p>Indirect sharp modifications of habitats will give populations less time to recover from extreme climatic events, for example, by reinforcing their negative impacts by decreasing the ability of species to recover from environmental perturbation. Substantial examples emphasize how important it is to consider the impacts of extreme climatic events in the context of LUCC. The responses to increasing extreme events influence plant functioning across spatial and temporal scales, and plantâ€“water relations seem to be very vulnerable to extremes; flooding may have stronger impacts on physiological processes than changing mean climate.
