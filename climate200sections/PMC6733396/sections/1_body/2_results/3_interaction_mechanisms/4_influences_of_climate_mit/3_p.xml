<p>In a region mostly with intact ecosystems, it is wise to prevent anthropogenic habitat degradation, and thereby maintain its intrinsic stability. In the process of habitat restoration, allowing species to migrate with global warming can help increase the resilience of fragmented landscapes in the face of climate change. As climate change mitigation effort increases, loss of natural vegetative cover that directly resulted from LUCC generally declines. The implementation of measures to mitigate climate change could simultaneously prevent habitat loss driven by LUCC in biodiversity hotspots. For ecological communities, whose mobility is limited, such as freshwater communities, buffer strips can be established to minimize damage from agricultural runoff.
