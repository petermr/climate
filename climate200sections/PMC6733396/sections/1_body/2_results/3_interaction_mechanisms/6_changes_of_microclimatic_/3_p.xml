<p>Disadvantageous landscape structure may severely hinder species movement and their ability to track climate envelopes. Species may shift downslope or upslope as a direct consequence of habitat modification, either following permanent habitat changes such as recreational activities and management practices, or owing to other local changes in habitat suitability. Species with greater dispersal ability, higher reproductive rate, and ecological generalization are better able to expand into new regions and establish new populations, so they tend to have larger geographical ranges. Conversely, species with low adaptability and dispersal capacity will have difficulty finding appropriate habitats to occupy, ultimately leading to increased extinction rates. In reality, the process of migration itself is likely to be dangerous because migrating individuals may be forced to move to unsuitable habitats or be exposed to predators during flight.
