<p>Global biodiversity is changing with climate gradient, and land‐use change can modify microclimatic gradients. At any given time, the spatial arrangement of habitats may influence landscape processes such as functional connectivity, edge effects, and ecological integrity.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">65</xref> These processes are particularly important in landscapes that are intensively managed, and natural or seminatural habitats are highly fragmented. Greater variation in spatial heterogeneity tends to a wider environmental tolerance, which may improve resilience to climate change. In general, increasing land‐use heterogeneity has limited potential to offset negative effects of intensification. In other words, even moderate increases in local land‐use intensity can cause biotic homogenization. Mountainous regions tend to be heterogeneous, including great topographic and altitudinal diversity, so that species may be better able to escape the effects of climate change vertically.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">66</xref> However, in a landscape with low heterogeneity, species are forced to seek adaptive climatic conditions for longer distance movement. For instance, tropical ecosystems often have a shallow latitudinal gradient in temperature that makes it harder for organisms to shift ranges poleward compared with temperate organisms.
