 </sup>. Average monthly MODIS Aqua Global Level 3 mapped mid-infrared nighttime SSTs from January 2003 (the earliest available date) through December 2010 were obtained at a 4.6 km spatial resolution for each locality (Sesoko Island 26.65854°N 127.8611°E; Scott Reef 14.167959°S, 121.87968°E). Monthly SST records were extracted from each study site and mean monthly SST temperature was calculated.
