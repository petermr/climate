<p id="Par11">To estimate the distribution of the frequency of thermal-stress events, we obtained Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) data from 1950–2016. The ONI is the standard metric used to identify El Niño (warm) and La Niña (cool) events in the tropical Pacific, and is a running 3-month average sea-surface temperature anomaly for the Niño 3.4 region

 </sup> (5°N–5°S and 120°W–170°W), based on the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST v4) dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climate Data Center. These data were derived from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset at a 2° by 2° spatial resolution (

El Niño events were defined as five consecutive three-month periods, at or above the 0.5 °C anomaly. We categorized El Niño events into one of four strengths based on the magnitude of the anomaly: (1) weak events were characterized as 0.5–0.9 °C anomalies, (2) moderate events were defined as 1.0–1.4 °C anomalies, (3) strong events were defined as 1.5–1.9 °C anomalies, and (4) very strong events were greater than or equal to 2.0 °C anomalies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The frequency of thermal-stress events was then estimated for each of four categories: (1) all events; (2) only moderate, strong, and very strong events; (3) only strong and very strong events; and (4) only very strong events (Fig.
