<p id="Par4">On modern coral reefs, we frequently ask the question: how quickly will a reef recover from a given disturbance? It is challenging to answer this question, particularly given the complexity of coral reefs and the multitude of nuances that influence recovery

 </sup>. Recovery depends on many interacting factors, including species composition and environmental and geographic vicissitudes. Understanding these factors and accurately predicting the recovery rates of coral populations is critical in a rapidly changing climate

 </sup>, which is characterized by ocean warming and an increase in the frequency of acute thermal-stress events
