 </sup>. Although corals on tropical reefs are adapted to warm waters, they rarely experience an annual temperature range greater than a few degrees Celsius. Warmer than average temperatures combined with high seasonal irradiance can cause a dysfunction in the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis that leads to coral bleaching, and under extreme conditions leads to mortality

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
