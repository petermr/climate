<p id="Par18">Our nonlinear hybrid-stochastic-dynamical system allowed us to predict and compare a suite of coral-population responses under various climate-change scenarios. The resultant model predicted that coral populations responded more strongly to intensifying stochastic temperature anomalies than gradual increases in background global temperatures. Three parameters consistently affected the coral-population estimates in our model: (1) 
 <italic>ε</italic>, which is the ‘extreme-event coefficient’, or the magnitude of the temperature anomaly; (2) 
 <italic>r</italic>, which determines the rate of recovery of each coral population; and (3) γ, which is the impact rate of background temperature on the coral population.
