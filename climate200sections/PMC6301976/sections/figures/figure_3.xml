  <p>Predictions of % coral cover for (
   <bold>a</bold>) southern Japan and (
   <bold>b</bold>) Western Australia through to the year 2100, for sea-surface temperatures predicted under climate-change scenario RCP 4.5 Wm
   <sup>−2</sup> (i.e., 1.8 °C) and intermittent temperature anomalies (lambda = 0.0001, gamma = 0.001, 
   <italic>f</italic>(
   <italic>ε</italic>) is estimated as −
   <italic>ε</italic>
   <sup>3</sup>). In both 3a and 3b, the top graph shows one model run through to the year 2100, whereas the bottom left graph shows the results of 1000 model runs as a heat map, and the bottom right graph shows the resulting percentage coral cover estimates in 2100 as a frequency distribution. Vertical black dashed vertical lines indicate thermal-stress events, and the red dashed horizontal lines are credible intervals on the model output distributions.
