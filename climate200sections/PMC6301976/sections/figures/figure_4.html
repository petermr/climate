 <caption> Predictions of % coral cover for ( a) Acropora spp. and ( b) Porites spp. in Western Australia, through to the year 2100, for sea-surface temperatures predicted under climate-change scenario RCP 4.5 Wm −2 (i.e., 1.8 °C) and intermittent temperature anomalies (lambda = 0.0001, gamma = 0.001, f( ε) is estimated as − ε 3). The left graph shows the results of 1000 model runs as a heat map, the right graph shows the resulting percentage coral cover estimates in 2100 as a frequency distribution, and the red dashed horizontal lines are 95% credible intervals on the model output distributions. </caption>
