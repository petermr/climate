<p>Marx et al. (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) identified 14 articles highlighting that shifts in rainfall and solar radiation influence tea yields and quality with implications for farmer livelihoods. For example, Biggs et al. (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) demonstrate that climate change is impacting farmer livelihoods across four major tea-growing regions of Assam, India. Boehm et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) show that a decrease in solar radiation in the previous growing season is associated with lower tea yields. However, the literature is missing a systematic review that synthesizes the evidence of environmental effects on tea quality and, the directionality of changes in quality parameters.
