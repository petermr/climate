<p>This review article employs tea (
 <italic>Camelia sinensis</italic>; Theaceae) to understand how climate change impacts crop quality of a culturally-relevant beverage plant. Tea, the botanical source of all white, green, oolong, black and pu-erh tea beverages, was selected as a study system because of its prevalence in diets globally, its production in over 50 countries on five continents (FAOSTAT, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and because it is a plant that is cultivated for its quality based on secondary metabolites (Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Polyphenolic catechin, methylxanthine (i.e., caffeine), and volatile secondary metabolites, coupled with carbohydrates and amino acids, contribute to tea quality through influencing the flavor and appearance of tea (Drewnowski and Gomez-Carneros, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Scharbert et al., 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) as well as its health claims including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective, cardio-protective, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-atherosclerotic activities (Trevisanato and Kim, 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Lin et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Clement, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Tea is further suitable as a study system to examine the effects of climate change because it is a woody perennial that experiences multiple decadal effects of climate change. Successful tea cultivation tea is dependent on climatic conditions including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and solar radiation (Wijeratne, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).
