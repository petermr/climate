<p>The biological population/study unit is tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> L.; Theaceae). The intervention/exposure that we examined is environmental variability linked to climate change, which includes variables including temperature, precipitation, elevation, seasonality, location, herbivory, soil, and solar radiation. As we found a lack of published studies directly examining climate effects on tea quality based on our preliminary review, we included environmental factors that vary with global change in systematic review search protocol. The comparator assessed in our review was variation in a specific environmental variable from a baseline evaluation or other comparison. The outcomes that we examined were impacts on the biochemical parameter of tea quality including secondary metabolite chemistry that consists of phenolic catechins, methylxanthines (including caffeine), amino acids (including theanine), and a range of volatile compounds.
