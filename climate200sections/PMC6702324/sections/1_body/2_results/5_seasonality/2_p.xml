<p>Fourteen seasonality studies demonstrated that concentrations of individual catechins, phenolic secondary metabolites, and / or antioxidant activity decreased with a seasonal shift from the spring and/or first tea harvest to other seasons, particularly the monsoon season (Sud and Baru,

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). Two seasonal studies showed that while some phenolic secondary metabolites, and/or antioxidant activity decreased with a seasonal shift from the spring and / or first tea harvest to other seasons, other secondary metabolites and / or antioxidant activity increased. Ahmed et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>) demonstrated that concentrations of desirable phenolic catechins were up to 50% lower during the beginning of the monsoon season compared to the spring, while total phenolic concentrations and antioxidant activity increased.
