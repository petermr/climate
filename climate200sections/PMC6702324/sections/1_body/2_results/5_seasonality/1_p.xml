<p>One-fifth (18 of 86) of the studies reviewed assessed the effects of seasonality factors on tea quality including change of harvest season between spring, summer, autumn, and winter harvest seasons or shifts between dry and wet seasons as well as bud burst (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The main seasonality factor examined was comparing the spring harvest to either the summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter, with a comparison between the spring and monsoon season being the most prevalent seasonal comparator. The spring tea harvest season is generally the first harvest season that follows winter dormancy in direct response to increased temperatures (Ahmed and Stepp,

The main quality parameters measured in reviewed studies on seasonality were phenolic secondary metabolites (including individual catechin compounds) and / or antioxidant activity (14 studies), followed by volatile metabolites (4 studies), and caffeine (a methylxanthine compound; 4 studies).
