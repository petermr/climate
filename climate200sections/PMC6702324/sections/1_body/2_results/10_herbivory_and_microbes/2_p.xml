<p>One microbe study focused on the pathogen 
 <italic>phomospsis</italic> (Ponmurugan and Baby, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and the other focused on the healthy soil fungi 
 <italic>Arbusular mucro</italic> (Singh et al., 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The presence of the pathogen reduced polyphenol and amino acid levels in Ponmurugan and Baby (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Inoculating tea plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased catechin and other polyphenol levels in tea as well as amino acids and caffeine (Singh et al.,
