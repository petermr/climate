<p>Three studies on herbivory and two studies on microbes examined the effects of various insects (tea aphids, tea mosquito bug, and Kanzawa spider mites) and microbes (
 <italic>phomospsis</italic> and 
 <italic>Arbusular mucro</italic> fungi from natural and cultivated tea rhizospheres) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Herbivory resulted in either a decrease in catechins (1 study; Chakraborty and Chakraborty, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), increase in catechins (1 study; Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), increases in volatiles (1 study; Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), and increase in some volatiles and decrease in other volatiles (1 study; Han and Chen, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Han and Chen (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) found that tea aphid-damaged tea shoots showed the presence of volatile compounds benzaldehyde and E-2-hexenoic acid which favorably contribute to aroma. Intact tea shoots on the other hand had butanoic acid-3-hexenyl ester and 1-octanol. None of the herbivory studies demonstrated that caffeine and amino acid levels were impacted.
