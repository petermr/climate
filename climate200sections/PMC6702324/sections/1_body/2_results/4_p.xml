<p>The reviewed studies were carried out in a range of tea producing and consuming countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the studies included a wide range of different tea cultivars of the 
 <italic>assamica</italic> and 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> varieties of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> including AC-259, T-78, B-157, B-777, S-449, UPASI-9, UP-2, UP-3, UP-8, BSS-2, TV-23, TV-25, TV-26, ZC108, ZC302, LJ 43, Derepazari 7, Fener, Yulan, and Fudingdaba. However, many of studies did not specify the variety, cultivar, or landrace of the tea examined. The lack of information on the variety of tea as well as the broad range of cultivars examined prevented analysis of the response of tea plants to environmental variables on the basis of tea variety and cultivar.
