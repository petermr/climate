<p>Studies demonstrate that higher elevation is generally associated with higher tea quality as measured by higher levels of catechins and other polyphenols as well as caffeine (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Four studies found that tea catechins and other polyphenols increased with elevation (associated with cooler temperatures and higher oxidative stress) (Akhlas,

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ohno et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and one study found lower catechin levels with higher elevation (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Three studies found that caffeine was higher in tea cultivated at higher elevation as compared to lower elevation (Akhlas, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Abeywickrama et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ohno et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and one study found lower caffeine levels with higher elevation (Abeywickrama et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). One study demonstrated that amino acid levels increase with higher elevation compared to lower elevation (Ohno et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) while one study found that amino acids were higher for lower elevation tea samples (Abeywickrama et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). One recent study (not included in this review) demonstrated an increase in favorable aromatic compounds that have sweet, floral, and honey-like notes with an increase in elevation while exhibiting a decrease in caffeine, epicatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and catechin (Kfoury et al.,
