<p>The stimulation of tea growth resulted in increased amino acid and vitamin C from application of Se (Hu et al., 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Deficiency and toxicity impacts from Zn (Mukhopadhyay et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Fe (Hemalatha and Venkatesan, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) were observed on growth and enzymatic activity in tea; Venkatesan et al. (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) also observed that excess Mn resulted in lower amino acid and carotenoid content of tea leaves. Three papers evaluated the impacts of Mg fertilization on growth and composition of tea. The work of Ruan et al. (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) focused on growth, which increased with Mg addition, but also Mg content and amino acid mobility in tea plants. Jayaganesh and Venkatesan, (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Jayaganesh et al. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) also noted increased amino acid content with the addition of Mg, and Jayaganesh et al. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) observed that different forms of Mg had differential effects on catechin and carotenoid content of tea leaves. Increasing the supply of available N in soil was found to increased amino acid content of tea leaves (Venkatesan et al., 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ruan et al., 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2007b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), although other studies (Han et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hamid et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) noted primarily increased growth with increasing N availability, rather than changes in plant composition.
