<p>The six studies on the effects of light factors explored shading treatment, light intensity, and light quality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). One of these studies found that polyphenols increased with an increase in light (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) while one study found an inverse relationship of light and polyphenols (Zheng et al., 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and two studies showed that some polyphenols increase with an increase in light and others decrease (Ku et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Song et al., 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Ku et al. (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) found that shade cultured green tea (tencha) had lower levels of phenolic epigallocatechin and epicatechin compounds as well as higher levels of amino acids compared to unshaded green tea while having higher levels of gallocatechin. These difference in polyphenol profiles resulted in the shade cultured tea to have higher umami profile and less astringent taste than the unshaded tea.
