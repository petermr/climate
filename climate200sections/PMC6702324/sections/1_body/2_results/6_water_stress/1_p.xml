<p>A total of 10 studies examined responses of tea plants to low water availability, including drought stress and soil moisture content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Five of these studies showed an increase in phenolic compounds and/or antioxidant activity with drought stress (Hernández et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Upadhyaya et al., 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>,

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Bhattacharya et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) while two studies showed a decrease in these compounds (Cheruiyot et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and two other studies showed both an increase and decrease in these compounds with drought stress (Chakraborty et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Upadhyaya and Panda, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Hernández et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) found that phenolics (including epicatechin and epigallocatechin gallate) accumulated in drought-stressed tea plants. Cheruiyot et al. (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) found that declining soil water content over a 12-week period significantly reduced growth and total polyphenolic concentrations in tea shoots depending on cultivar type. Chakraborty et al. (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) highlight that while phenolic secondary metabolites initially increase with drought stress, they decrease during extended drought stress.
