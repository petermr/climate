<p>This review highlights the difficulties in comparing disease data across the Nordic countries. Until present, each countryâ€™s health authority has carried out disease control according to its own national disease pattern with the consequence of large data variability across nations. This limits the possibilities to conduct multi-country studies to determine the impact of climate change on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and to identify measures to address the effects of climate change on infectious diseases in the Nordic countries. Harmonization of data collection for notifiable diseases could be achieved through standardization across national administrations and dissemination of disease data via shared services. In addition, collaboration and harmonization to include other Arctic nations, namely Russia, Canada and the US, would also be desirable. Such a collaboration already exists in the form of the International Circumpolar Surveillance System (ICS) that surveys five invasive bacterial diseases throughout the circumpolar area [

We suggest a Nordic summit aiming at producing a common list of reportable diseases and a common method of reporting them in order to improve international surveillance and actions. Such a summit might evolve into a circumpolar collaboration involving all eight Arctic countries.
