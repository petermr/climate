<p>Qualitative variations across countries also depend on different functionalities of registration systems and administrative regulations. Some diseases are not notifiable in all Nordic studied countries. For example, borreliosis is not notifiable in Sweden and leptospirosis not in Norway. In Greenland, only one case of q-fever has been identified (in 2007) through the scientific literature [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>], and only anthrax, neuroborreliosis and leptospirosis are notifiable. In Iceland, only cases of cryptosporidiosis have been reported, although all diseases except for TBE and borreliosis are notifiable in the country. The collected data showed that no human cases of anthrax have been reported in Sweden (from 1965), Finland (from 1995), Greenland (from 1979) and Island (from 1997). However, in 2000 a case of injection anthrax was diagnosed in a heroin addict in Oslo, Norway. This was the first known case in the world of systemic anthrax transmitted through injecting drug use. Previously, the last human case of anthrax in Norway was in 1967.
