<p>The national authorities that survey reportable infectious diseases in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland, were asked to submit information of collected data of anthrax, borreliosis, brucellosis, cryptosporidiosis, leptospirosis, nephropathia epidemica (
 <italic>Puumala virus</italic>), Q-fever, tick born encephalitis (TBE), and tularaemia. This data covered country, district, age, sex and date for each registered disease case from 1965 to 2016. Notifiable infections are reported directly from laboratories directly to the national authorities of each country except for erythema migrans (cutaneous borreliosis) that is a clinical diagnosis reported by clinicians when notifiable. The diagnostics are based on accredited methods, internationally established and similar for all Nordic countries.
