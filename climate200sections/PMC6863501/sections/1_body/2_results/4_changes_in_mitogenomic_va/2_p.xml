<p>In Scandinavia, we identified 10 and five haplotypes in the historical and modern samples, respectively, in the alignment comprising 13 224 bp of the mitochondrial genome (electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S5). Using the shorter alignment including the Pleistocene samples, we found eight and three haplotypes in the historical and modern populations, respectively (figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F4">4</xref>). The loss of haplotypes in the Scandinavian arctic fox population also resulted in a significant decline in nucleotide diversity (

In the modern population, three haplotypes were shared with the historical population, while two haplotypes were private: A10 was found in two samples from Lierne and two samples from Borga, and B9 was found in two samples from Vindelfjällen and two samples from Borga (electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and table S3). The ABC analysis supported an almost 20-fold reduction in female effective population size with
