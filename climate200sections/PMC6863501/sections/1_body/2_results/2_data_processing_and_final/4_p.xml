<p>The low-coverage sequencing, variable endogenous DNA content and high clonality in the Pleistocene samples did not permit reconstruction of entire mitogenomes from all the samples. Thus, in order to maximize the number of Pleistocene samples included in the comparisons, we compiled a reduced alignment comprising 3954 nucleotide sites (at greater than 3x coverage). However, to obtain an even more accurate estimate of the loss of mitogenomic diversity during the last 100 years, we also constructed a second alignment that comprised 13 224 sites (at greater than 3x coverage), which excluded all Pleistocene samples. Taken together, both datasets comprised five Pleistocene samples (two from Western Europe and three from Beringia), 16 historical samples, and all 24 modern samples (including the modern samples from Russia and Canada), plus seven modern farm fox samples (
