<p>Importantly, these findings indicate that climate-driven range contractions do not simply lead to a reduction in population size, but also that local populations become extinct without contributing to the gene pool of populations further north. This implies that future climate-induced range contractions may lead to larger losses of genetic diversity than predicted from simplistic models based solely on population size. Moreover, unique genetic variants (e.g. local adaptations) in southern populations will probably be lost as these populations become extinct. At a broader level, such a lack of habitat tracking needs to be accounted for in climate-based models that predict future extinction rates [
