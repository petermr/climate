<p>The distribution of the Arctic biota decreased considerably during the transition from the last glaciation to the present interglacial. Our results suggest that a contraction in available habitat (during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition or the mid-Holocene) caused local subpopulations to become extinct, which in turn led to losses of unique genetic diversity. This implies that the genetic diversity in many Arctic species probably was reduced even before the impact of human activities that accelerated during the industrial revolution. This might have affected the adaptive potential in the arctic fox as well as other cold-adapted species, thus increasing the impact of subsequent anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, there are suggestions that climate change has again started to affect the Scandinavian arctic fox population in recent decades, through an expansion and ensuing interspecific competition from red foxes that have moved into mountain areas previously inhabited by the arctic fox [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Assuming that these consecutive losses of mitogenomic diversity, owing to climate change and anthropogenic impact, also reflect changes in autosomal genetic diversity, this would imply that the arctic fox might be particularly vulnerable to the future challenges entailed by climate change.
