<p>In the case of the Scandinavian arctic fox, this population is currently fragmented into several relatively isolated subpopulations along the Scandes mountain range [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our results suggest that future changes in tree-line extent and red fox distribution will probably lead to a northwards contraction of the arctic fox's distribution, and thus a loss of any genes unique to the southernmost subpopulations.
