<p>We found five previously unknown haplotypes, three in the historical population and two in the contemporary population. The two new haplotypes found in the modern population were not shared with the historical population. A possible explanation for these private haplotypes in the modern population could be insufficient sampling in the historical population. Haplotype accumulation curves suggested that the asymptote for the modern population was reached at five haplotypes, while the haplotype accumulation curve for the historical population failed to reach the asymptote (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Further sampling might thus identify these two modern haplotypes (A10 and B9; electronic supplementary material, figure S1 and table S3) in historical samples. It is also possible that the private haplotypes are the result of random mutations. However, taking the mutation rate of the mitochondrial genome into account, it seems highly unlikely that this would have happened in two individuals in less than 150 years. A third possible explanation would be recent immigration events from the population in Russia, which would be in line with results from previous studies [
