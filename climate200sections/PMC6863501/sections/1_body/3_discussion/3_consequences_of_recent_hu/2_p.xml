<p>Our results show that the Scandinavian arctic fox population lost at least 50% of its mitochondrial haplotypes as a result of the demographic bottleneck that started at the turn of the twentieth century (

 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the higher resolution of the mitogenomic sequences allowed for better estimations of both haplotype and nucleotide diversity, revealing previously unknown significant losses following the bottleneck (
