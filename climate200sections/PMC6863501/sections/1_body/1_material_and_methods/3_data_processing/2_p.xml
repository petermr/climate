<p>The resulting sequence data were processed following the approach in Pecnerova 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, the sequencing reads were trimmed of adapters and paired reads were merged using the software S
 <sc>eq</sc>P
 <sc>rep</sc> 2.2 (
 <uri xlink:href="http://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep</uri>). The merged reads were then mapped to a reference mitochondrial genome of the arctic fox (GenBank accession no. NC_026529.1), using the BWA aln algorithm [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Next, the alignments were converted from SAM to BAM format, coordinate sorted, indexed, and PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and a custom script [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Mapped reads were subsequently extracted and imported into G
 <sc>eneious</sc> 8.1.6 [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consensus sequences were called for all samples separately, using the majority call rule with a minimum coverage of at least three independent reads. To estimate endogenous DNA content in the Pleistocene and historical samples, the raw reads from each sample were mapped to an internally generated de novo assembly of the arctic fox genome (J. von Seth, K. Norén, A. Angerbjörn, L. Dalén 2016, unpublished data), and the proportion of reads that mapped to the reference genome prior to duplicate removal was estimated with Q
