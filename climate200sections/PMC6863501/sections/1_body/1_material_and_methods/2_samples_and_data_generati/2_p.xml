<p>We sampled 30 historical Scandinavian specimens, collected between 1845 and 1927, and 26 Late Pleistocene Eurasian remains that ranged in age from 30 000 to 12 000 years before present (BP) (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2). The samples comprised mainly arctic fox teeth and bones, and also one complete frozen carcass (sample IN18-002; electronic supplementary material, figure S4). The frozen carcass was recovered from permafrost deposits in Belaya Gora (Yakutia, Russia), and was sent for dating at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit.</p>
