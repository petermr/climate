<p>While uncovering the mechanisms that determine plant distribution ranges along elevational gradients is highly relevant, fewer studies exist on latitudinal range limits.

 <italic>Quercus variabilis</italic> along a 1,500 km north-south transect in China. They conclude that carbon or nutrient availability are likely not the main driving factors of range limits of this species, while recruitment limitation seems more important at the species' northern edge (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Species ranges are affected not only by climate, but also by direct human intervention.

 <italic>Lupinus nootkatensis</italic>, a high-latitude invader introduced in Iceland in the 1940s, on the native flora. The invasive legume tended to decrease plant species richness in the most species-rich habitat (heathland), while promoting especially late-successional and ruderal species in woodland and grassland. As the habitat suitable to lupine could double the next 50 years due to climate change, its role in altering competitive interactions and facilitating succession implies that it may further accelerate climate change-related ecological transition in cold biomes (cf. Hiltbrunner et al.,
