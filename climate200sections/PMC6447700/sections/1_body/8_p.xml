<p>This research topic has shown that the speed with which climate change is happening, encompassing long-term warming but also short-term temperature anomalies and concurrent changes in precipitation, may overwhelm some species and alter community composition and functioning also in the resilient ecosystems of the cold biomes. Persistence in a community will likely depend on the plasticity to cope with both changes in the abiotic and the biotic environment, including interactions with novel (invasive) species. Short and longer term responses may differ, which is why more experiments are needed that monitor communities for multiple years. This is challenging in these often remote locations, and made more difficult as the baseline climate is shifting so rapidly. Understanding, disentangling and predicting the longer-term outcomes of global change impacts in cold biomes will therefore likely remain a frontier in plant ecology.</p>
