<p>To elucidate these and other climate change related issues, long term studies are essential (Knapp et al.,

 <italic>Pinus uncinata</italic> seedlings (later saplings) were exposed to warming, one-time NPK fertilizer addition and/or interaction with the dominant shrub 
 <italic>Rhododendron ferrugineum</italic>. Interestingly, they find that the nature of interactions with this shrub changed as the experiment went on, switching from facilitation by the shrub to competition and ultimately competitive release. Moreover, the impacts of warming and fertilization (including their interactions) differed depending on presence or absence of 
 <italic>R. ferrugineum</italic>, highlighting the importance of considering species interactions in studying global change impacts.
