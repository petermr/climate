<p>Climate change is a global phenomenon, with particularly rapid changes observed in many mountain ranges, the arctic, and the Antarctic Peninsula, where temperatures have risen at twice the global average or more (Gobiet et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Johannessen et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The accelerated warming in these cold biomes is mainly due to various positive feedbacks, such as albedo effects related to declining snow and ice cover (Screen and Simmonds, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Pepin et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Apart from temperature, precipitation patterns have been changing in most of these regions as well, with varying impacts on snow pack depths, growing season length and in some regions also on the prevalence of summer drought (Gobiet et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Bintanja, 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). While these rapid environmental changes have the potential to significantly alter responses and dynamics of the local ecosystems (e.g., Niittynen et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), logistic challenges have constrained research in these often remote locations. In this research topic, we collected a number of studies that have overcome these challenges to report on the responses of cold biome ecosystems to various aspects of climate change.
