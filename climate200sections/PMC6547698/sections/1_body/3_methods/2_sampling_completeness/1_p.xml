 </sup>. To minimise the effect of potentially inadequate sampling on vulnerability analyses we excluded 402 locations (100 km × 100 km grid cells) with low sampling completeness (&lt;0.7) from our analyses. Completeness was estimated from the ratio of observed to expected species richness, where expected richness was calculated from occurrence records using a bias-corrected Chao1 estimator
