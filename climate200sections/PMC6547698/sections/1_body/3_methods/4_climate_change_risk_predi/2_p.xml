<p id="Par41">Safety margin was calculated for each location as the difference between the median observed climatic limit across all species present and the long-term average climate conditions in the location (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This measure captures how much warmer, or drier, a location could become before its hypothetical typical species exceeds the observed climatic limit.
