<p id="Par37">Cultivated records from botanic gardens inventories published in Bush 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2018) were available for 6,159 species in our dataset (30%). We matched the locations (latitude and longitude coordinates) of each botanic garden and species combination to gridded climate data as described for all other occurrence records. We then counted how many species had upper climate limits from cultivated records which exceeded estimates from native range occurrences. It was not possible to calculate an analogous metric from cultivated records for MAP because of the confounding effect of irrigation in botanic gardens on plant performance. The effect of irrigation is also likely to increase the ability of cultivated plants to tolerate warmer conditions; additional water increases the potential for evaporative cooling to maintain favourable leaf temperatures for photosynthesis
