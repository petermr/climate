<p id="Par35">We matched cleaned occurrence records for each species to gridded long-term average climate conditions to identify the highest MAT and lowest MAP at which the species occurs. Climate data were matched at a 5 arc-minute resolution (~8 km) to approximate the average spatial accuracy of herbarium collections. The 98
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of MAT and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> percentile of MAP were taken as the upper and lower observed climatic limits for each species, respectively. Climate data were accessed from Worldclim
