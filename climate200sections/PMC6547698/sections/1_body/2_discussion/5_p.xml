<p id="Par25">Despite the high vulnerability of the SWAFR to changes in rainfall, the typical species in vegetation across most of Australia has relatively high ability to withstand reductions in MAP projected for the decade 2070. That is, projected reductions in MAP are far smaller than the safety margin for drying of the typical species across 98% of the continent. In one sense this simply reflects the projections of GCMS which show that a relatively small area of Australia is exposed to substantial MAP decrease by 2070 (

 </sup> and the adaptations of many Australian species to variability. For instance, our safety margin metric shows that, relative to average precipitation totals between 1950–2000, the average species in 95% of Australian vegetation may tolerate a reduction of between 10% and 69% of current precipitation amount before exceeding its observed climate limit. This is a conservative measure given that the predicted higher temperatures across much of the continent will lead to higher rates of evaporation, hence generally less plant-available water for a given MAP.
