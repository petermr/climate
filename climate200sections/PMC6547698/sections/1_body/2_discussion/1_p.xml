<p id="Par21">Vegetation across almost half of Australia (47%) may be at risk from projected increases in MAT based on spatial analysis of exposure and safety margins for temperature climate change by 2070. Risk from MAT change is most acute in the northern, tropical regions of the continent and across most of the state of Western Australia (

In these regions, projected exposure to MAT change by 2070 exceeds the inherent safety margin, or tolerance, to warming of the typical species that characterises this vegetation (measured as the difference between the median, upper temperature limit across all species present, and the long-term MAT in each location (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E,F</xref>)). The adaptive capacity of vegetation to tolerate changes in MAT is predicted to be highest in regions of low climate change risk (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). By contrast, at-risk regions with low adaptive capacity under warming conditions – such as Tropical Eucalypt Savannas in the north, and the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR) of Western Australia – may be important targets for intensive conservation management, particularly where land-use is rapidly changing. The SWAFR also contains the only vegetation identified as at -risk from projected reductions in MAP by 2070. Across this vulnerable vegetation – which covers 2% of the continent (170,000 km2) – MAP is consistently projected to decrease by 2070 across the five GCMs assessed and the safety margin for drying of a typical species is larger than these projected reductions. When directly compared using 
 <italic>z</italic>-scores, safety margins for both temperature and precipitation are significantly larger than expected by chance across the tropical regions of the continent (red locations; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>); smaller margins than expected are found across large areas of the arid zone (blue locations; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>), increasing the likelihood of climate related impacts on vegetation composition in these regions due to the interactive effects of changes in temperature and precipitation.
