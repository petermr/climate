<p id="Par28">Gathering data on fundamental limits is time-intensive and therefore necessarily limited to a small subset of (presumably) representative species. We generously estimate that c.1% of the flora of Australia (approximately 200 species) have had fundamental tolerance limits to temperature and precipitation characterised via experimentation, and that these species are heavily biased toward a few species in the genera 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>. Although these genera are dominant in many landscapes, they represent a relatively modest fraction (c. 10%) of the plant diversity in Australia, which encompasses c. 20,000 species from &gt;200 families.
