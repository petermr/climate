<p id="Par11">Across Australia, safety margins for decreases in MAP range between 0.4–1791 mm and 38% of vegetation has safety margins which are smaller than a ≤ 100 mm decrease in MAP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). That is, the typical species across 38% of the continent can tolerate a reduction of precipitation of 100 mm or less before exceeding its observed climate limit. MAP itself varies widely across the continent so there is also merit in considering proportional reductions in precipitation. When safety margins are calculated relative to a proportional 10% reduction in MAP at each location, 18% of continental vegetation exceeds its observed lower limit, increasing to 95% of the continent under a 50% reduction in MAP.
