<p id="Par10">Safety margins for increase in MAT in the vegetation of Australia range between 0.2–8.5 °C. Vegetation across 8% of Australia has a safety margin of &lt;1 °C, and 26% a safety margin of &lt;2 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Areas with the smallest safety margins are clustered in the tropics – particularly in the north-west of the continent – and in the upper part of the southwest floristic region of Western Australia. In these locations, based on the observed climate limits of their typical species, vegetation has a relatively small safety margin for adjusting to projected increases in temperature. The vegetation with the most tolerance (largest safety margin) to temperature change occurs across the south-east corner of Australia, including the majority of Tasmania and extending into coastal parts of Queensland and the central inland. Many of these regions with large safety margins are characterised by relatively high topographic relief (&gt;1000 m elevation;
