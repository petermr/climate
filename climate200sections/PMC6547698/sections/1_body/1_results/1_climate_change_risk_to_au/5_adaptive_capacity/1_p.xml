<p id="Par16">Based on estimates of the niche breadth of a typical species, the adaptive capacity of vegetation to MAT increase and MAP decrease under climate change ranges between 2.4–9.1 °C and 155–1686 mm, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2G,H</xref>). Higher values indicate vegetation is adapted to a wider breadth of MAT and MAP and assumed to have the potential to adapt 
 <italic>in situ</italic> to climate change. Vegetation with relatively high adaptive capacity for temperature change is mainly located in the south-east of the continent and the south-west of Western Australia has the lowest adaptive capacity to climate change based on our estimates of the niche breadth of a typical species. Desert regions of Western Australia have the lowest adaptive capacity for MAP change (light blue regions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>), though precipitation is already low in these regions and plants exhibit many adaptations to arid conditions.
