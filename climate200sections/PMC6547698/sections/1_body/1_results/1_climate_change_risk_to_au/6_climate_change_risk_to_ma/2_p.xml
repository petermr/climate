<p id="Par20">Projected changes in MAP relative to vegetation safety margins place several vegetation communities at risk in the south-west of Western Australia, though the amount of vegetation affected may be small relative to its overall extent. For instance, ‘Low Closed Forests and Tall Closed Shrublands’ are at risk, but only 3.7% of their overall extent is threatened. Various Acacia-dominated MVGs (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are also at risk from decreases in MAP, however the total extent of the MVGs affected is small (
