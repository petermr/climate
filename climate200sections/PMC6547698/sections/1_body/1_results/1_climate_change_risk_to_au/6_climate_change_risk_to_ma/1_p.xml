<p id="Par19">Of the 22 MVGs analysed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), 21 occur in areas deemed at risk from increases in MAT by 2070, and 13 in areas at risk from MAP decreases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). ‘Tropical Eucalypt Woodlands/Grasslands’ are most at risk, with 98% of their extent occurring in areas where exposure to climate change exceeds the safety margin for warming of the typical species present. Other at-risk MVGs include: ‘Melaleuca Forests and Woodlands’ (91% of extent at risk); ‘Low Closed Forests and Tall Closed Shrublands’ (78%); and ‘Hummock Grasslands’ (77%). Both ‘Melaleuca Forests and Woodlands’ and ‘Tropical Eucalypt Woodlands/Grasslands’ are restricted to the tropical north of Australia and are relatively small in overall extent across Australia (Area (%); Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similarly, ‘Low Closed Forests and Tall Closed Shrublands’ which are found in Western Australia have a very small overall extent (0.2% of Australia), 78% of which falls in areas of climate change risk.
