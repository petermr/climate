  <p>Relationship between risk and adaptive capacity to climate change in Australian vegetation. Risk from changes in MAT (°C; 
   <bold>A</bold>) and MAP (mm; 
   <bold>B</bold>) by 2070 under RCP8.5 is calculated as the difference between exposure to climate change and the safety margin to warming, or drying, of a typical species in each location. Adaptive capacity is calculated as the climatic breadth across the range of a typical species in each location. ‘Typical’ species are represented by the median response of all species present at a location. Replicates in (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) are locations (grid cells) from across Australia. Only locations with high herbarium sampling completeness (ratio of observed to expected richness from Chao1 estimator ≥0.7) were included as replicates in statistical analyses (
   <italic>n</italic> = 388 cells; 49% of Australian land area). The black line and grey fill depict the LOESS regression line and its confidence intervals. Note that for MAT, at risk locations have positive values on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis whereas for MAP values are negative. This is because risk values summarise a tolerance deficit for the typical species in terms of increasing temperature or decreasing precipitation.
