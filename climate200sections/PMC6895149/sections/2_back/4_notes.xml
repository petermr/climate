 <title>Data availability</title>
 <p>Datasets generated by this study are available in two digital data repositories. Modelled emissions from individual sills (underlying Figs. 
  <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
  <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) are available in GitHub repository smj75/sillburp with the identifier 10.5281/zenodo.3457994 (ref. 
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
  </sup>). Modelled emissions from the NAIP sill province (underlying Figs. 
  <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and 
  <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), sill dimension measurements (underlying Fig. 
  <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), sill province area information and sill distribution measurements (underlying Figs. 
  <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
  <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
  <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) are available in GitHub repository smj75/NAIPburp with the identifier 10.5281/zenodo.3454889 (ref. 
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
  </sup>). The seismic reflection data used to measure sill dimensions and sill spatial distributions are owned by various third parties. The data owners and the means of accessing the data are listed in repository 10.5281/zenodo.3454889 (ref. 
  <sup>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
  </sup>). Some of these datasets are not publicly available and were used under license for this study, and requests to access these datasets must be addressed directly to the data owners.
