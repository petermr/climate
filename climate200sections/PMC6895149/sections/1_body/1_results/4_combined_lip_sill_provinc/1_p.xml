<p id="Par17">We developed a method to determine the carbon emissions flux and cumulative emitted carbon from the entire sill province by summing thermogenic and magma degassing emissions from many sill–vent systems when

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) using a Monte Carlo approach. In any one NAIP simulation, initial (maximum) emissions flux from individual sill–vent complexes ranges from 0.0005 to 0.05 PgC yr
