 <italic>Q</italic> at the time of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary has been estimated from the relative timing and amplitude of peak dynamic support (i.e. mantle convectively supported uplift) in two sedimentary basins separated by 400 km either side of Scotland: the Judd region of the Faroe-Shetland Basin and the Bressay region of the North Sea

 </sup>. Dynamic support is a direct indicator of the thermal anomaly that generated the sill province magma. These studies estimate a parameter 
 <italic>k</italic>, with units of diffusivity, which characterises the speed of the locus of peak dynamic support as it travels along a line between the two sedimentary basins. Both the location of the plume centre and the shape of the plume head must be known to convert 
 <italic>k</italic> to plume area flux 
 <italic>Q</italic>. The published 
 <italic>Q</italic> values assume a radially symmetrical plume head

 </sup>. To quantify the resulting uncertainty in plume area flux, we re-calculated 
 <italic>Q</italic> values from published 
 <italic>k</italic> values
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> using eight different model plume centre locations and their associated plume head aspect ratios (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The median value 
 <italic>Q</italic> value is 4 km
 <sup>2</sup> yr
 <sup>–1</sup>, the interquartile range is 2.4–6 km
 <sup>2</sup> yr
 <sup>–1</sup> and the 10–90 centile range is 1.6–8 km
 <sup>2</sup> yr
 <sup>–1</sup>. This uncertainty could be significantly reduced in future if more high-quality dynamic support or mantle temperature records can be obtained.
