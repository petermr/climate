<p id="Par13">A large literature describes igneous sills from the NAIP and around the world but little sill surface area, thickness and emplacement depth information is tabulated. To obtain statistically representative distributions required for stochastic emissions modelling, we measured many hundreds of NAIP sills on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) seismic reflection data (Fig.
