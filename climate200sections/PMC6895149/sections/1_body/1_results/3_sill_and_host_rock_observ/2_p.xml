<p id="Par14">Sill surface areas come from seismic surveys close to the centre of the NAIP. These were checked with reference to 2D data from across the NAIP (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and satellite images of the Karoo sill province. Over 10% of observed sills have surface areas of 100–1000 km
 <sup>2</sup>, with potential to generate significant (0.01–0.1 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup>) short-term (c. 1 year) peaks in emissions flux. For both 3D and 2D data, we excluded surface areas &lt; 10 km
 <sup>2</sup> from the histograms used for stochastic modelling because hydrothermal vents are rarely observed associated with such small sills, so their methane likely migrates over a timeframe longer than PETM initiation. Depths of intrusion were obtained from the subset of sills for which the coeval seabed can be identified from associated vents and/or onlap of strata onto forced folds

 </sup>. Measured emplacement depths were corrected for post-emplacement compaction. The observations are well approximated by a normal distribution with mean depth 1.15 km and standard deviation 0.85 km, truncated at the shallow end.
