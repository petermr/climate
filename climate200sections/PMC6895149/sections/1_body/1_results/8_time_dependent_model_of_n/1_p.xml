 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows a Monte Carlo simulation of sills intruding the Vøring-Møre–Faroe-Sheltand–Rockall basin chain at increasing distances from the plume centre as the hot mantle ring beneath sweeps outwards beneath the lithosphere. At the median estimated mantle plume flux of 4 km
 <sup>2</sup> yr
 <sup>–1</sup>, peak carbon emissions flux of 0.37 ± 0.05 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> occurs 11.7 ± 4.1 kyr after province initiation, and a cumulative mass of 2750 ± 1280 PgC was delivered by this time (means of 100 stochastic runs ± 1 s.d.). For the interquartile range of mantle plume flux, the peak emissions flux range is 0.2–0.5 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> and occurs at 9–15 kyr after province initiation. The modelled rise in carbon emissions flux is convex upwards for all values of mantle plume flux, with over half of eventual peak flux reached &lt;5 kyr after province initiation.
