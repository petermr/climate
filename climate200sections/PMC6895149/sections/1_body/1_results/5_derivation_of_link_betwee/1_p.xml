 <sub>repeat</sub> based on the mantle convection process that generated the NAIP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This approach provides confidence because the mantle convection cell that generated the Paleocene–Eocene NAIP, known as the Icelandic mantle plume, can be observed and measured beneath the North Atlantic today. Modern and ancient NAIP basaltic magmas are generated by decompression melting of unusually hot mantle within the head of the Icelandic mantle plume. Flow of mantle rock within this and other plumes is unsteady, or pulsing

 </sup>. In the latest Paleocene, a blob of unusually hot mantle was carried up the stem of the plume, between Greenland and Scotland, and spread outwards beneath the North Atlantic plates

 </sup>. Decompression melting occurred when the hot ring passed beneath the channel of thin lithosphere

 </sup> comprising the Vøring, Møre, Faroe-Shetland and Rockall sedimentary basins, which had formed by rifting during Mesozoic time. Separation of basaltic magma from its mantle source is an efficient process, and about one third of the magma reached the upper few kilometres of the overlying sedimentary basin fill, to be intruded as sills or erupted as lavas

 </sup>. These scenarios for NAIP mantle plume pulsing, magma generation and magma transport are generally accepted because North Atlantic oceanic crust contains a continuous record of Iceland plume pulsing between the Paleocene and present
