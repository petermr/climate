<p id="Par12">Magmatic carbon emissions are easier to model than thermogenic emissions because it is not necessary to track reaction kinetics. Carbon is strongly incompatible in all primary minerals formed during solidification of basaltic sills. Almost all mantle-derived carbon dioxide dissolved in the magma therefore exsolves shortly before solidification, mixes with the super-critical host-rock pore fluid, and escapes through hydrothermal vents along with thermogenic methane. Our parameterisation is based on the same set of sill and host-rock characteristics used for the thermogenic parameterisation except that
