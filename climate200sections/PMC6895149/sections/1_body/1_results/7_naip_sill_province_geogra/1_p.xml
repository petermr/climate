<p id="Par24">Very few studies state values of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> (the number of sills per unit area of the seafloor) or provide enough information to derive 
 <italic>ρ</italic> with confidence. We therefore used seismic reflection data to measure 
 <italic>ρ</italic> across the NAIP (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Measurements of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> from 3D seismic data are most reliable, but relatively few are available. We therefore developed a Monte Carlo approach to correct 
 <italic>ρ</italic> measurements from 2D data grids for the “missing sills” that exist in the gaps between the 2D lines (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We observe 0.07 sills km
 <sup>–2</sup> near the centre of the NAIP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). For this first attempt at simulating NAIP emissions, we captured the observed decay of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> with radial distance using a Gaussian of half-width 600 km.
