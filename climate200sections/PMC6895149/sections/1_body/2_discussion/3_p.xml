<p id="Par30">Over 90% of the carbon emissions from the sill province come from thermogenic methane, with the remainder from mantle-derived carbon dioxide (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). Thermogenic methane contributes most carbon for two reasons. First, sill magma typically contains 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> by mass, or 0.14% carbon, whereas the mean organic carbon content within NAIP sill host rocks frequently exceeds 1% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Secondly, the width of the thermal aureole is between 2 and 8 times the sill thickness (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a, b</xref>).
