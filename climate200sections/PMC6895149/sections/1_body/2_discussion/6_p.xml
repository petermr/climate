 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) show that sill-induced hydro-fracking is common in the upper few kilometres of sedimentary basins. Such observations underlie the widespread assumption that generated methane escapes efficiently. On the other hand, a model of the sill-associated hydrothermal convection system suggests the proportion of methane that escapes may be lower
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. Since it is clear that shallowly intruding sills generate their own fracture permeability, any hydrothermal system model must include a description of how the fracture permeability varies with pressure. This relationship is controlled by the compressibilities of the sill magma/rock and host rock
