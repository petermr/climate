<p id="Par29">Our simulations are also characterised by a rapid post-peak decline in emissions flux. This decrease arises from a combination of three effects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). First, the number of sills in a given area decreases with distance from the province centre. This observation can be explained because the magnitude of a radially spreading mantle thermal anomaly decreases with distance

 </sup>. Secondly, the proportion of the anomalously hot mantle patch that is overlain by the sill province also decreases with radial distance. Both these geographic functions are initially at or close to maximum, and decrease most rapidly over the first 50,000 years, leading to increasing
