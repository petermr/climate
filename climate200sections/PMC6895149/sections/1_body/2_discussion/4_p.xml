 </sup>. Such records provide tighter constraints on carbon emissions flux than records of carbon isotopic composition alone because of trade-off between the mass and isotopic composition of the emitted carbon. Nevertheless, a large literature on carbon isotopic records across the PETM exists. We therefore estimated the carbon isotopic composition of NAIP sill province methane in order to demonstrate compatibility with PETM C-isotope records as well as the newer pH and carbonate dissolution records (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The predicted carbon isotopic composition of NAIP sill province emissions is near the limit of the uncertainty range of isotopic compositions estimated by joint inverse modelling of isotopic composition and surface ocean pH, but closely comparable with the estimated composition for a sensitivity experiment with the same PETM onset duration as our simulation

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). More generally, our models can easily explain the globally observed negative shift of several per mil. over the PETM onset period
