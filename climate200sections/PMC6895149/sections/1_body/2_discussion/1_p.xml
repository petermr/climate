<p id="Par28">Our mantle process approach to the NAIP duration problem shows that greenhouse gas emissions could have occurred rapidly enough to initiate PETM climate change. The initial rapid emissions increase is a consequence of high flow speeds within the solid asthenospheric mantle, because rapid delivery of hot mantle source into the melting zone leads to high magma production rates. Our model has lateral mantle flow rates of over 400 mm yr
 <sup>–1</sup> near the NAIP sill province centre, which are determined from measurements of temporally changing surface uplift observed within the stratigraphic record
