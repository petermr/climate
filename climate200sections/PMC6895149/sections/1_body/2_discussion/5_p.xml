<p id="Par32">We only account here for mantle-derived carbon released from shallowly intruded NAIP sill magma, generated by lithospheric thin-spot melting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Magma generated within the Europe-Greenland continental break-up zone released further mantle-derived carbon. The total volume of lavas and deep intrusions comprising the NAIP magma-rich passive margins is 3.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>3</sup> (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>), which could release 14,100 PgC of carbon with a mantle-derived isotopic signature. The duration of eruption/emplacement, related to the duration of rifting leading to continental breakup, is 1–3 Myr (refs. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>), considerably greater than the timeframe of emplacement of the sill province. The resulting emissions flux of 0.005–0.015 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> and mass of 50–150 PgC from lavas and deep intrusions during the PETM onset period is negligible in comparison with the flux of 0.2–0.5 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> and mass of 2750 PgC from thermogenic methane and sill-degassed carbon dioxide. This difference in emissions flux reflects the difference between the relatively low rates of mantle upwelling and melting driven by plate spreading, and the significantly greater mantle upwelling and melting rates driven by convective flow close to the centre of a major plume head.
