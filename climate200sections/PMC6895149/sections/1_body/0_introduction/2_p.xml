<p id="Par4">Several mechanisms by which the NAIP might have supplied carbon-based greenhouse gases to the ocean–atmosphere system have been proposed. Carbon dioxide was released from NAIP magma
 <sup>

 </sup>. Methane and carbon dioxide were generated by thermal maturation of organic material within sedimentary rock next to shallow igneous intrusions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Regional seabed uplift may have released methane, depending on the size of the pre-PETM sub-seafloor methane hydrate inventory
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. This seafloor uplift would have altered oceanic circulation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> and regional climate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>, which could have led more indirectly to pulsed greenhouse gas release
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. However, all these theories struggle because none has been shown to deliver a peak in gas emissions flux whose duration matches the &lt;20 kyr timeframe of PETM onset

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, the NAIP has typically been relegated to a driver of longer term (10
 <sup>5</sup>–10
 <sup>6</sup>-year) background warming, which perhaps triggered more rapid release of carbon from other temperature-sensitive near-surface reservoirs around the globe
