<p id="Par7">Here we use our concept of 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> to demonstrate for the first time that the NAIP sill province could have intruded sufficiently rapidly to initiate the PETM. We tackle the problem in two stages. First, we determine the 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> that would be required for the NAIP sill province to match carbon emissions rates that have been independently shown to initiate the PETM. Secondly, we demonstrate that such 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> values were likely achieved during the most intense phase of NAIP sill intrusion. These two steps required development of several new databases and calculation procedures. We began by developing a new parameterisation of thermogenic and magmatic carbon emissions from individual sill–vent systems of known dimensions intruding a host of known organic content. We then assembled a large new database of NAIP sill and host-rock observations. We also developed a method to determine the carbon emissions from an entire sill province by summing emissions from many sill–vent systems. Together, these components allow Monte Carlo simulations of geologically plausible combined carbon emissions from a sill province when the 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> is specified a priori, which show that 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> of 2–6 yr would be required to initiate the PETM. To complete the second stage in our argument, we developed a novel alternative to dating volcanic products that considers instead the mantle convection process that generated the sill province magma: we derived an expression linking 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> to mantle plume flux (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We then assembled new databases of mantle plume flux measurements and the geographical distribution of sills across the NAIP. We use this information to estimate how 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> varied throughout the emplacement history of the NAIP sill province, and show that 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> could have dropped below 5 yr and initiated the PETM. Thus, we present the first predictive, mechanistic model of carbon emissions flux from a LIP.
