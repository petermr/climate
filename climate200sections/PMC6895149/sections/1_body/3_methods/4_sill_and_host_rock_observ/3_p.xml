<p id="Par57">Maximum sill thickness was measured for the subset of sills that show seismic reflections from both top and base, on both 3D and 2D datasets. The maximum sill thickness used in the stochastic modelling was obtained by first applying the linear regression to the diameter equivalent to the stochastically chosen surface area (assuming a circular sill), and then perturbing this result by a thickness selected from a uniform distribution between ±100 m.</p>
