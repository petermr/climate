<p id="Par58">We measured sill thickness as a function of radius both directly, where top and bottom reflections were visible, and indirectly from forced folds in the contemporary seabed. Thickness profiles near sill tips can only be estimated from forced folds because the resolution of oil-industry seismic data prohibits reflections from the bottom of the sill when its thickness is smaller than about 70â€‰m. Fold-derived thickness profiles were corrected for compaction owing to post-intrusion sediment deposition. Other factors such as flexural host-rock deformation, anomalous cementation, fold-crest erosion and interaction with adjacent forced folds could also possibly corrupt sill thickness profiles derived from folds. We minimised influence of these complicating factors by only selecting examples where the thickness profiles from decompacted folds and direct sill imaging agree within measurement uncertainty. Maximum thickness estimated from the forced fold was used to scale the thickness profiles for both the forced fold and the directly imaged sill. The distance between the fold-derived thickness maximum and the fold-derived edge of the sill is then used to scale distance. The two profiles from a sill centre to the tips on either side were scaled separately in terms of distance.</p>
