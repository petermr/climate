<p id="Par75">The NAIP 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>prov</sub> model based on the alternative 
 <italic>ρ</italic> model is often lower than the sediment-based 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>prov</sub> curve from which the alternative 
 <italic>ρ</italic> model was derived via Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ47" ref-type="">47</xref> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, purple versus blue). This discrepancy is expected for two reasons. First, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ47" ref-type="">47</xref> assumes long-time steady state via Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>, so it should underestimate 
 <italic>ρ</italic> when 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>prov</sub> increases rapidly. Secondly, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ47" ref-type="">47</xref> does not account for overlap between sill aureoles, so it should underestimate 
 <italic>ρ</italic> at later times. Nevertheless, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ47" ref-type="">47</xref> provides a useful new starting point for estimating the extent to which uncertainties in 
 <italic>ρ</italic> and also Γ might explain differences between carbon source- and carbon sink-derived estimates of 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>prov</sub>.
