 </sup>. The first group, RG1, describes thermal maturation of labile (oil-prone) kerogen to produce mostly oil and a smaller amount of methane. The second group, RG2, describes thermal maturation of refractory (gas-prone) kerogen to produce methane. The third group, RG3, describes thermal maturation of vitrinite, leading to increasing reflectance. The fourth group, RG4, describes cracking of oil (produced by RG1) to produce methane. Each reaction group covers a natural range of kerogen composition, with a corresponding range of activation energies. Therefore, each group is described by three parameters: a frequency factor 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>E</sub>, a mean activation energy 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>a</sub> and a standard deviation of activation energies
