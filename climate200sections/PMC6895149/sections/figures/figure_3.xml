  <p>Comparison between full carbon emissions modelling results and new carbon emissions parameterisation. Thick black lines represent full thermal and reaction kinetic modelling results; red dotted lines represent new parameterisation. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> Mass and flux of carbon emissions from breakdown of labile kerogen for sills of thickness 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 m, all intruded at 1 km depth. Thick grey line shows a power law with exponent 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.54 for reference; all calculations in this figure assume a constant host-rock density of 2100 kg m
   <sup>−3</sup>, appropriate for the mean emplacement depth (1.2 km), in order to illustrate the consistent tapered power-law behaviour of emissions. 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold> Mass and flux of emissions from breakdown of labile kerogen for sills intruded 1, 2 and 3 km deep, all 100 m thick. 
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold> Mass and flux of emissions for a 100-m-thick sill intruded 2 km deep from three reaction pathways: breakdown of refractory kerogen; breakdown of labile kerogen to oil and then cracking of oil to gas; and direct from labile kerogen. 
   <bold>g</bold>, 
   <bold>h</bold> Modelling of emissions for a sill of variable thickness profile. A radially symmetrical sill with maximum thickness 200 m and intruded 2 km deep is divided into five annuli of equal surface area. The thickness of each annulus is prescribed by the radial thickness profile parameterisation in Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Emissions from these five annuli (thin grey lines) are summed to estimate the total (thick black lines).
