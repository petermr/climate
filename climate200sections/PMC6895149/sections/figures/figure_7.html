 <caption> Solid earth controls on onset and decay of carbon emissions. a, b Time between successive sill intrusions ( τ repeat) as a function of long radius of the underlying mantle thermal anomaly ( a) and of time ( b), used for the simulations in Fig.  8. Thick and thin lines show median and interquartile range of plume flux estimates. Horizontal grey bar shows τ repeat range required to explain PETM onset, based on the constant- τ repeat experiments (Fig.  5). c, d Crosses show observed number of sills per unit area, ρ, measured on seismic reflection data (thicker lines from 3D data; thinner lines from 2D data); vertical error bars show total uncertainty range in ρ (Table  2); horizontal error bars show range in radius/time corresponding to footprint of seismic survey (Fig.  6). Black curve shows smooth parameterisation of the observations, used in Fig.  8. Grey line shows alternative ρ distribution inferred from a carbon sink-derived emissions estimate 5 (Methods; Supplementary Fig.  5). e, f Area function Γ that relates expansion rates of the mantle thermal anomaly (magma source) and the NAIP sill province (magma fate). Functions Γ ( r) and ρ( r) control sill intrusion period according to 1/ τ repeat =  Q Γ( R) ρ( R) (see Results for derivation), where Q is the mantle plume area flux and R is the long radius of the plume head. g, h Cumulative proportion of overlapping thermal aureoles (stack of 100 stochastic runs). </caption>
