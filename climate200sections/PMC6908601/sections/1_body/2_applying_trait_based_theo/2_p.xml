<p id="Par6">Although a general theory of life history is attractive, the C-S-R strategies do not necessarily map clearly on to microbial systems. In the plant C-S-R framework, Grime [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] defined habitats based on gradients in disturbance intensity and stress, including multiple abiotic and resource-based factors. These gradients were thought to select for C, S, or R strategies defined by plant traits including morphology, growth form, relative growth rate, leaf longevity, phenology, and seed production. Although some microbial traits like growth rate, biomass turnover, and dormancy may be analogous to plant traits, it can be challenging to apply a plant-based theory to heterotrophic microbes. A major distinguishing factor remains the reliance of heterotrophic microorganisms on an external source of carbon and energy that drive differential cellular allocation and lead to tradeoffs in traits. This makes the quantity and quality of resources in the surrounding environment a key factor in influencing species distribution. In addition, the way microbes encounter and respond to disturbance and stress may not be entirely distinguishable. Thus, it remains unclear how plant-based C-S-R strategies emerge from underlying microbial traits.
