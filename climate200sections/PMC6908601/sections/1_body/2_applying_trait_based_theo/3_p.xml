<p id="Par7">Although plant C-S-R strategies do not map well on microbes, it is notable that Grime [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] himself suggested some traits useful in mapping mycelial fungi to the C-S-R strategies: rapid growth and soluble carbohydrate use for ruderals, dense mycelium and rhizomorph production for competitors, and slow growth, persistent mycelium, and low spore production for stress tolerators, which suggests that C-S-R framework may work for mycelial fungi. Moreover, given the vast metabolic diversity of microorganisms and their ability to inhabit extreme environments that are both stressful and frequently disturbed, it is also unclear what dimensionality is needed to adequately describe microbial life history strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A framework like the C-S-R life history triangle is a good start in advancing trait-based microbial ecology, while keeping in mind that increasing trait dimensionality may help better predict species distributions.
