<p id="Par8">Here we propose a revised life history theory for microbes that builds on the work by Wood et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Their framework justifies microbial C-S-R classifications based on predicted genomic traits. Traits of the competitor strategy focus on antibiotic production and resource acquisition through siderophores and membrane transporters. Stress tolerator traits relate to damage repair and maintenance of cell integrity. Ruderal microbial traits include investment in processes that promote rapid growth. Wood et al. also define a fourth group of traits related to foraging, such as chemotaxis and flagellum production. Our revised framework emphasises three strategies somewhat analogous to Wood et al.’s version of C-S-R but reclassified into three main microbial life history strategies: high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A) and stress tolerance (S), or Y-A-S along two main axes of environmental variation: resources and abiotic stress (Fig.
