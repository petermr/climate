<p id="Par4">In plant communities, tradeoffs in key fitness traits have been represented through conceptual theories of r- and K-selection, the “leaf economics spectrum” and Grime’s competitor-stress tolerator-ruderal (C-S-R) framework. The r- and K-selection concept recognises two functional groups of organisms: r-selected strategies have short life expectancy and large reproductive effort, whereas K-selected strategies have long life expectancy and invest a smaller proportion of energy and resources into reproduction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Grime’s C-S-R triangle is an alternative framework that enumerates three major plant life history strategies: competitors (C) excel at maximising resource capture in productive and undisturbed systems, stress tolerators (S) prevail in continuously low-resource and stressful conditions, and ruderals (R) occupy recently disturbed but less stressful habitats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Such tradeoffs have been shown to apply globally across biomes thus providing the quantitative basis to functionally represent the enormous taxonomic diversity of plant communities in vegetation models [
