<p id="Par25">Models representing continuous variation in traits across taxa are also promising tools for predicting biogeochemical processes based on the Y-A-S framework. For example, DEMENT is a local scale, trait-based model that simulates litter decomposition and soil carbon transformations by diverse microbial communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The model uses relationships between Y and A traits as a mechanistic basis for predicting how microbial communities and carbon cycling processes will respond to future environmental change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]). Yield in the model is a function of multiple factors, including substrate type and stoichiometry, enzyme production rates, uptake investment, and temperature. The most recent version of DEMENT also includes a simple representation of drought stress tolerance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. After incorporating trait tradeoffs derived from omics or other data sources for individual taxa, DEMENT projects community responses and carbon cycling consequences under simulated environmental conditions. Model outputs can be validated with in-situ trait distributions at a community level or with ecosystem processes like organic matter decomposition rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This validation approach can also be applied to other individual-based models that simulate spatial structuring of microbial populations based on functional groups characterised by traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Based on the successful trait-based modelling of global vegetation, one could expect rapid progress in developing models that incorporate microbial traits.
