<p id="Par24">Adding a third dimension may help achieve the level of complexity required to represent the metabolic diversity of microbial populations. A trait-based modelling framework based on microbial Y-A-S strategies holds promise for representing microbial characteristics in simulations of system-level processes at various spatial scales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The cellular mechanisms underlying tradeoffs in key traits can be incorporated into microbial functional models like MIMICS to reveal how these tradeoffs structure microbial communities and their resulting carbon cycle functions. This advance could be achieved by incorporating Y-, A- and S-functional groups into models. Alternatively, explicit microbial representation may not be required to accurately model ecosystem functions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. At larger scales, microbial community composition and physiology may be a response to changes in resources and abiotic conditions rather than an independent driver of processes. To this end, we suggest that growth yield can be a master response trait in ecosystem models that integrates the physiological processes of populations comprising communities [
