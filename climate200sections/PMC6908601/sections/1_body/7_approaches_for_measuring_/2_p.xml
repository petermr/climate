<p id="Par15">Omics datasets on genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites can be used to quantify the traits that define our Y-A-S strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Population-level trait assessment will help validate genotype-phenotype linkages and enable quantification of Y-A-S life history strategies at the community level. Trait information from populations can be gathered from sequenced genomes where cultured microbial strains are available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. An increasing number of studies are reporting new media and culturing conditions to isolate previously uncultured microbes which should increase the diversity of populations in databases. Data can also be extracted from existing databases that link taxonomy, phylogeny, or specific genes to measured traits and environmental preferences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In other cases, individual population genomes can be assembled from culture-independent shotgun metagenomic datasets; this novel approach is gaining popularity as it facilitates physiological investigations of hitherto uncultured taxa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].
