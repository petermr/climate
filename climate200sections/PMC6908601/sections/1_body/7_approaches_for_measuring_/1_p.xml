<p id="Par14">Technological innovations like next generation sequencing have massively improved our understanding of the taxonomic and functional diversity of soil microbial communities and their shifts in response to anthropogenic influences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Current approaches have mostly focused on identifying taxonomic and functional responses to environmental changes. However, integration of these large microbial molecular datasets with process rate measurements remains a challenge, thereby making it difficult to link microbial composition and function with ecosystem processes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. More efforts are needed to determine how microbial genomic information translates into traits that influence abundance, metabolite production, and ultimately carbon cycling rates in ecosystems.
