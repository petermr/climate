<p id="Par21">We posit that microbial metabolic investments and the resulting tradeoffs among key traits determine the contribution of microbial processes to ecosystem-level carbon fluxes. These traits will interact with abiotic factors such as microbial residue chemistry, mineral composition, and aggregate structure to determine long-term organic matter storage in soils. Microbial physiological responses and the resulting effects on growth yield can affect carbon balance through two main mechanisms. On the one hand, microbial biomass is thought to contribute significantly to organic matter accumulation and hence to the genesis of soil organic matter [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. On the other hand, microbial biomass and extracellular enzymes contribute to plant litter and soil organic matter degradation. Under our Y-A-S framework, Y-strategists with increased investment into growth and biomass production would contribute to microbial residue formation that can be stabilised through organoâ€“mineral interactions or aggregation. In contrast, A-strategies should contribute more to decomposition and carbon loss through investment in extracellular enzyme production [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Selection for A-strategists could also occur under a lower organic matter environment that stimulates enzyme production to mine resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Carbon impacts of S-strategists might depend on the type of stress compounds produced, with more complex compounds like EPS contributing more to carbon storage than simple compounds like osmolytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. By diverting investments away from growth, S-strategists could also reduce soil carbon accumulation. The effect of microbial physiological adaptation to climate change and its consequences for soil C cycling could thus be determined by assessing shifts in microbial Y-A-S life history strategies.
