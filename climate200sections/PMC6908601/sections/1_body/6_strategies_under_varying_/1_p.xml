<p id="Par13">Tradeoffs in resource allocation should prevent microbes from excelling at multiple Y-A-S strategies. Different strategies should be favoured under different environmental conditions arising from spatial or temporal variability in resource status and abiotic conditions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). For example, drought should select for S-strategists that increase investment in osmolyte production to maintain cellular osmolarity. Osmolyte production is energetically very expensive and reduces growth yield [

In environments with high availability of polymeric resources (e.g. polysaccharides) but fewer simple resources (e.g. simple sugars, amino acids), depolymerisation-optimised A-strategists should outcompete Y-strategists by investing in extracellular enzyme machinery. Thus, abiotic stress or resource limitation should select against Y-strategies because of a need for investment in costly resource acquisition or stress tolerance mechanisms. Thus, A-strategists catalyse polymer decomposition and soil carbon loss, whereas Y-strategists may convert monomeric substrates into microbial residues that can then contribute to organic matter stabilisation [
