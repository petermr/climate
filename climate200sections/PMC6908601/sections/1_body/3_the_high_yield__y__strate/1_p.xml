<p id="Par9">We define yield, often measured as carbon use efficiency, as the amount of microbial biomass produced per unit of resource consumed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. High yield strategists maximise the fraction of resource uptake that is allocated to biosynthetic processes by investing in central metabolism and associated assimilatory pathways such as amino acid, nucleotide, and fatty acid synthesis to build cellular components using these precursor compounds. The absence of resource limitation and stress are expected to favour the high yield strategy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although parallel to the plant ruderal strategy, the Y strategy is not defined by growth rate, i.e., the change in microbial biomass per unit time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In-situ growth rate is not a coherent strategy but rather a complex emergent property that depends on both growth yield and the rate of resource acquisition. In fact, evidence suggests that the growth rate and yield may have a negative relationship [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or a positive one [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] depending on the system.
