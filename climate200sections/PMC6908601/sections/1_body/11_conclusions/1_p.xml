<p id="Par26">There is growing interest in applying trait-based concepts to predict the microbial mechanisms driving global biogeochemical cycles. By adapting several theories from plant ecology, we define microbial high yield, resource acquisition, and stress tolerator strategies based on key traits that are linked to organismal fitness. Our Y-A-S framework is one testable alternative for organising life history strategies of microbes. We recognise that other useful frameworks may also be proposed. Still, there is good evidence that growth yield, resource acquisition, and stress tolerance strategies encompass many of the key traits that regulate microbial community functioning and appear in microbial-explicit models. Therefore, we envisage our Y-A-S framework will guide new empirical and modelling studies on the mechanisms driving soil carbon fluxes. We anticipate that these approaches will improve our understanding of the physiological constraints facing microbes under anthropogenic influence. By linking population-level response traits to community and ecosystem processes, our life history theory can improve predictive understanding of soil C responses to future climatic change.</p>
