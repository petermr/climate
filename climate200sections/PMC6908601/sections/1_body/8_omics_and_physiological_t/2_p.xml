<p id="Par18">This complexity creates challenges for extracting trait information on growth yield from omics datasets. Still, several genes/transcripts/proteins linked to central carbon metabolism and associated assimilatory pathways have been found to correlate with high yield (Y) strategy. For example, markers of pathways such as ribosomal protein synthesis, amino acid synthesis, nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism could be linked to growth but may not necessarily be an indication of an efficient physiology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Increased respiration associated with enzyme production (A strategy) or maintenance of cellular integrity (S strategy) should directly and negatively affect measured growth yield. Metabolic pathways based on alternative electron acceptors are often a characteristic of extreme environments and can lead to low growth yields [
