<p id="Par20">Stress tolerance traits in the form of σ factors, molecular chaperons or specific physiological adaptations can be extracted from widely used omics tools. For example, increased frequency and diversity of chaperons has been observed in soil communities from intensive land use treatments, demonstrating the cellular need for biomolecular repair in such degraded soils [

Promising genetic indicators for communities under drought stress include genes for synthesis of osmolytes like trehalose, glycine betaine, choline, and ectoine as well as genes for extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and capsular synthesis that help form “sponges” to retain water in cell envelopes.
