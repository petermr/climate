<p id="Par17">Growth yield (synonymous with growth efficiency) is a challenging property to extract from omics datasets because we still do not understand its genetic determinants. However, there are quantitative methods for estimating growth yield and its components (Table

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Approaches include measuring the change in biomass proxies and respiratory loss or following a tracer—commonly a stable isotope—in cellular fractions. Yield is often measured as the proportion of C substrate invested into biomass relative to that lost through respiration. Recent studies emphasise, though, that growth yield is actually an emergent and dynamic property of multiple underlying traits related to cellular maintenance, protein synthesis and export, cellular stoichiometry, electron transport chain and respiratory pathways [
