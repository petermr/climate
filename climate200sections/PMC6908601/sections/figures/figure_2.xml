   <bold>a</bold> Conceptual figure of microbial Y-A-S life history strategies. High yield (Y): maximises growth efficiency as a result of reduced investments in stress tolerance and resource acquisition; resource acquisition (A): preferential investment in cellular resource acquisition machinery; stress tolerance (S): preferential investment in stress tolerance mechanisms. 
   <bold>b</bold> Hypothesised strategies favoured under particular treatment combinations. The microbial three-dimensional Y-A-S triangle is arrayed on the combinations
