 <caption> Key meteorological forcing data and the variations of malaria in scenario S0. (a) Daily precipitation and (b) Mean daily air temperature (both are the same as in Fig 6); (c) Variation of exposed ( E h ) and infectious ( I h ) host populations modeled in the S-SEIR model; and (d) Variation of vector populations (susceptible S v , exposed E v , and infectious I v ) modeled in the S-SEIR model. N v represents the total adult vectors. The S-SEIR represents different states of adult vectors shown in S-ELPAs. </caption>
