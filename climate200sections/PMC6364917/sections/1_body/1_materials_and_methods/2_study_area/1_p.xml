<p>The case study is conducted for a site in rural area northwest of Malindi town (3.22°S, 40.12°E), Kilifi county, Kenya (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The region has high levels of malnutrition and incidence rate of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in which the 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> s.l. complex are the main vectors (87-95% vector population) [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For simplicity, we consider this complex as a single species and the only vector in the model for simulations. The average daytime temperature varies between 28°C and 34°C and mean annual precipitation is approximately 1180 mm divided into a long (April—July) and short (November—December) rainy seasons. The dominant livelihood is subsistence farming with 84.5% of the population living below the poverty line (

Maize is the main agricultural crop for a majority of households in the region. Other crops most commonly inter-cropped with maize include millet, cassava, and beans [

 <italic>Dhara</italic> model. In rural areas, we also assume that natural water on the ground is the primary habitat of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and larval collection in the region have shown that open, natural habitats were the most productive sites for 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0211258.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The domain of simulation covers approximately 440 square kilometers (22 km north to south and 20 km east to west) with a medium to high percentage cover of vegetation. We use model parameter sets similar to those used in previous studies [
