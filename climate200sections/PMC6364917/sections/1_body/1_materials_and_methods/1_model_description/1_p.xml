<p>We use a stochastic lattice-based integrated malaria (SLIM) model [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to predict the dynamics of malaria under climate change. SLIM consists of two time-continuous space-discrete models (S-ELPAs and S-SEIR) that considered the nonlinear relationship between temperature and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development inside 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors for estimating the EIP [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The model incorporates explicit coupling between entomological and parasitological processes, epidemiological statuses, and hydro-climatic conditions to capture the dynamics of malaria (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The stochastic entomological model resolves the life cycles in aquatic and adult phases of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes using the ELPAs (Egg, Larvae, Pupae, and Adults) structure [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The coupled epidemiology-parasitology model simulates stochastically the circulation of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in human hosts and adult 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors using the well-known SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These models are iteratively coupled in discrete space domains through the equality constraint of adult vector populations. SLIM also incorporates a meta-population approach to describe the spatial movements of vectors among discrete geographic domains. We refer the reader to original work [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for detailed formulation and description of SLIM model.
