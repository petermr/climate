<p>The ecology of malaria is markedly complex, involving two different replication cycles of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite alternating in human hosts and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors [

 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For malaria intervention, the ability to access health care and efficient vector control measures is critical to block the transmission and break the life cycle of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. For example, the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the most powerful interventions that reduced malaria-related mortality from all causes among children under fives by 20% for sustained periods in Africa [

Climatic factors especially air temperature and humidity play an important role in malaria transmission through influence on mosquito abundance, development, biting rate, and survival as well as parasite survival and extrinsic incubation period (EIP), the time taken by the parasites to complete their sporogonic cycles [

 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, climate change will likely affect the dynamics of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases in the future [
