<p>We compare the mean annual ET of the study area for the [CO

 <sub>2</sub>] at 550 ppm associated with additional increase of mean annual air temperature at Δ

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g006">Fig 6</xref>. The mean annual ET found in the present condition S0 is 541.1 ± 130.5 mm. We observe significant changes of annual ET, a key driver of soil moisture and ponding persistence, under all projected climate change scenarios. In S1, the decrease of annual ET (442.3 ± 100.7 mm) is attributed to the increase of vegetation water-use efficiency under the elevated [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] condition [

 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In S2, the mean annual ET is quite similar to that in S0. In S3, however, we find that mean annual ET is higher than in S0. These increases are directly dependent on the increases of air temperature at different magnitudes, offsetting the benefits of improving water-use efficiency under the enrichment of [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] condition. These changes in ET are expected to affect soil moisture and ponding persistence which control the habitat for
