 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the variation of total aquatic and adult mosquito populations in the vector dispersal model (S-ELPAs) in log scales. The results show that the variation of the mosquito population in both aquatic and adult stages are highly dependent on climatic factors. The largest and smallest total mosquito population during the years are found corresponding to the highest and lowest air temperature and rainy seasons, respectively. In the aquatic stage, the sensitivity of larvae development to air temperature change is found much lower than of egg and pupae which are shown in previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g007">Fig 7c</xref> implies that the mortality rate of mosquitoes subjected to environmental risks are high. The total population of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> eggs (
 <italic>E</italic>) could be approximately 7 and 50 times higher than the larval (
 <italic>L</italic>) and pupal (
 <italic>P</italic>) populations, respectively. The population of adult 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes is also sensitive to climatic conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g007">Fig 7d</xref>). We find that the fraction of host seeking mosquitoes (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub>) in the adult stage is high, consisting of ∼ 70−80% of the total adult population. The sub-population of oviposition site searching mosquitoes (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>o</italic>
 </sub>) or gravid females are usually 2−3 times larger than the resting mosquitoes (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub>). The high numbers of eggs deposited by female 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> during reproduction are likely a key factor for the high density of the vector in the aquatic environment. The total number of adult mosquitoes is equal to the vector population in the Malaria Transmission Model (S-SEIR) model and play a key role in the dynamics of the disease. Simulations of malaria dynamics in present climate (S0) conditions are used to compare with results obtained from simulations under climate change scenarios discussed in the next sections.
