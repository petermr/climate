<p>The observed monthly streamflow records for each studied watershed were firstly used to calibrate the transport parameters of the GWLF model, which mainly included Curve Number (CN) values for each land use type, evaporation cover factor for each month, two-level recession coefficient and seepage coefficient, and unsaturated leakage coefficient. The calibrated parameter set could describe the watershed hydrological process, based on which, the monthly streamflows were modeled and compared with the observed records to estimate the model performance (

These results indicated that the calibrated GWLF model could afford reliable modeled results of streamflow, based on which, the calibration of sediment parameters could be performed.
