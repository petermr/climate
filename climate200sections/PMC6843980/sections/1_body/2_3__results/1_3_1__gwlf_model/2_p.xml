<p>The calibrated sedimental parameters mainly included the USLE parameter for each land use, erosive coefficient for each month, power of sediment transport capacity, and sediment delivery ratio. Time series of observed and modeled monthly sediment yields during the study period are shown in

 <sup>2</sup> were 0.87 and 0.90 for the Wu-Qi watershed, and were 0.85 and 0.87 during the verification period with a slight decline similar to the streamflow process. There was a great error for the simulation of monthly sediment in July 2015 as the observed value was much larger than the simulated peak. However, the model outputs could fit well with several other peaks, and the test values were acceptable. Therefore, we could treat the sole underestimation as an outlier and accept the model accuracy. For the Huang-Ling watershed, the values of
