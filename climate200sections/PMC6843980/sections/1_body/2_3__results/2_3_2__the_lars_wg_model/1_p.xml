<p>The parameters set in the LARS-WG model for the two studied weather stations, Luo-Chuan and Wu-Qi, were calibrated based on sixty years of daily weather records, respectively. The alternative random seed number of 541 was used to generate synthetic daily weather for Luo-Chuan, and the random seed number of 1987 was used for Wu-Qi. Sixty years of synthetic daily weather data for each site were generated and compared with the observed daily weather data to assess the ability of the LARS-WG model following routine model applications based on three general statistical tests, which included the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test, the
