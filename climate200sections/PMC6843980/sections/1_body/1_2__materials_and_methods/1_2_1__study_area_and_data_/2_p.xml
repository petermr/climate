 <xref rid="ijerph-16-04054-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Arc Hydro Tools 2.0 was employed to generate the general watershed attributes of the river line and sub-watershed boundaries based on a spatial analysis of 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) maps. The 30 m grid maps of land use cover in 2015 were employed and analyzed by ArcGIS to calculate the areas of each land use type, which were classified according to China Current Land Use Classification (GB/T 21010-2007) into 25 sub-classifications, but only 14 types occurred in these two study areas. The watershed streamflows were calculated based on observed monthly river flow records divided by watershed area. These data were all used as model inputs and/or observed data in calibration or verification processes to support model applications.
