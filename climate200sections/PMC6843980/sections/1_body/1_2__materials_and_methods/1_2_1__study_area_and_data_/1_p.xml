<p>This study was carried out in the Loess Plateau in the northeast of China, and two headwater watersheds of the Bei-Luo-He River were estimated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04054-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The Bei-Luo-He River extends from the south side of Bai-Yu-Shan Mountain in Shaanxi Province and drains into the Wei-He River, which is one of the main tributaries of the Yellow River, China. The source watershed of the Bei-Luo-He River located above Wu-Qi Hydrological Gauge Station was used as one of the study areas. It is a cultivated land and grass-dominant upland watershed, with an area of approximately 3442 km
 <sup>2</sup>. In addition, the source watershed of the Ju-He River, a tributary of the Bei-Luo-He River, was also estimated, and the watershed located above Huang-Ling Hydrological Gauge Station was used as the other study area, which is a woodland-dominant upland watershed area, with an area of approximately 2274 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Both of the study areas were typical upland watersheds in the Loess Plateau, with similar elevation and slope. The average elevations of the Wu-Qi and Huang-Ling watersheds were 1544 and 1291 m, while the average slopes of the Wu-Qi and Huang-Ling watersheds were 14.7 degrees and 13.8 degrees, respectively.
