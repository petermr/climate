<p>The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was used for future weather data estimations. The LARS-WG is a stochastic weather generator based on a statistical downscaling technique [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It uses a series of semi-empirical distributions to describe site-scale climatic factors, and represents current and projected future climate status with a moderate data requirement and cost effective computational demand [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The LARS-WG can achieve a similar performance to other sophisticated models for site-scale temperature and precipitation estimations [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is able to generate long synthetic series of daily weather data under various climate change scenarios, and can be adopted with confidence for climate change impact studies together with the watershed model for hydrological and sedimental estimations [
