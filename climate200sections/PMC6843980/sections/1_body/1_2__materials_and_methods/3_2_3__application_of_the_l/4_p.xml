<p>Two future periods—2041–2060 (2050s) and 2061–2080 (2070s)—were considered in this study, and the WorldClim version 1.4 dataset was adopted to obtain confident GCM outputs. The original GCM outputs had been calibrated (bias corrected) and spatially downscaled using WorldClim 1.4 and released as refined global raster data with various resolutions [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There are a number of different GCMs, and they give different results. All the eleven available GCM outputs in WorldClim were considered, i.e., those which had complete results for four RCP scenarios and two future periods. An ensemble means based on the averages of eleven different GCM outputs was achieved for future climatic factor estimations to avoid uncertainty. The GCMs used in this study are summarized in
