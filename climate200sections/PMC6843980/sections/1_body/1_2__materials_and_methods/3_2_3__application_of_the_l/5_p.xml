<p>The global raster data at a 2.5 min spatial resolution in WorldClim 1.4 are adopted. They use one raster to represent 2.5 min of a longitude/latitude degree, which is approximately 4.5 km at the equator. The raster maps were estimated by Spatial Analyst Tools in ArcGIS 10.2, with batch commands in Python to estimate the changes in monthly precipitation and mean daily maximum and minimum temperature in the 2050s and 2070s under four RCP scenarios for each GCM. The average changes in the eleven GCMs were used to build the scenario analysis files of the LARS-WG, based on which, the model parameters were updated and used to generate future site-scale daily weather data [

Sixty years of synthetic daily weather data for each station were generated towards four RCP scenarios in two future periods to represent the predicted future climate conditions. These synthetic weather data were further used as input data for the GWLF model to estimate the responses of the watershed hydrological and sedimental processes, which are discussed in detail in
