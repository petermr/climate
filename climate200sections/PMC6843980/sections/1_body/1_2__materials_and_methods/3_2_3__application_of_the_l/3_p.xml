<p>There are four future climate change scenarios, namely, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, considered in this study. They were proposed by the IPCC in their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and are widely used in recent climate change impact studies. Different RCP scenarios are named according to radiative forcing levels for 2100 that also have different emission and greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. RCP2.6 represents a mitigation scenario with greenhouse gas concentration peaking between 2030 and 2040 and then declining thereafter. RCP8.5 represents a very high emission scenario with continuous rising of greenhouse gas concentration throughout the 21st century. RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are two medium stabilization scenarios. Emissions of greenhouse gas in RCP 4.5 peak around 2040 and then decline, and emissions of greenhouse gas in RCP 6.0 peak around 2080 and then decline. Various GCMs have been achieved based on different RCP scenarios to represent future climate status.</p>
