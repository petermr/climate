<p>The Generalized Watershed Loading Functions (GWLF) model was employed to model watershed transport processes concerning streamflow and sediment yield estimations [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. GWLF is considered to be a combined distributed and lumped parameter watershed model with reliable monthly estimations of streamflow and sediment yields as model results. For surface runoff estimations, GWLF is distributed in the sense that it divides multiple homogenous land use areas based on the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. For subsurface groundflow estimations, the model acts as a lumped parameter model with a linear groundwater reservoir to describe the shallow saturated subsurface zone and calculate flow yields. A daily water balance approach is operated to produce the daily hydrological process estimation and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) method is used for sedimental process estimation. Regional Nutrient Management (ReNuMa) software, which uses the same model components as GWLF, was used in this subject [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Two new modules, the segment function approach for the saturated zone and the leakage transport approach for the unsaturated zone based on a previous study, were added to refine the model capacity during low flow periods [
