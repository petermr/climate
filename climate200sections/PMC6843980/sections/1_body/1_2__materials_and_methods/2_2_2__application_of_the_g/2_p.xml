<p>The monthly records of streamflow and sediment yields from two hydrological stations (Huang-Ling and Wu-Qi, shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04054-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were used to determine the parameters of the GWLF model. The observed records from 2006 to 2011 were used in the calibration process, while the records from 2012 to 2015 were reserved for model verification. Only May to October had records of monthly sediment yields, while the records of monthly streamflow were available for all the twelve months. The daily records of temperature and precipitation from the two weather stations in/around the study area were used as the input data for GWLF, while the available records from 2009 to 2015 of the precipitation stations located in the study area were used to replace the data of weather stations for better estimations. The Thiessen polygon method was used to spatially integrate the records from multiple precipitation stations for one group of daily precipitation within each studied watershed [
