<p>In another view, the amount of annual runoff in both CGM and WW would go through a process of increasing firstly in the 2050s and then decreasing in the 2070s. In the 2050s, there were increasing trends of runoff for both CGM and WW, with a negative correlation with radiative forcing levels, i.e., the higher the radiative forcing level, the less the increase in runoff. In the 2070s, runoff in both CGM and WW represented decreasing trends under high radiative forcing levels. In CGM, the amount of annual runoff would decrease and return back to the baseline level for the scenarios of RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. In WW, only the scenarios of RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 would result in decreases in runoff yields, indicating a better resistance stability of WW to offset the impact of climate change with high radiative forcing levels on runoff. The amount of annual groundwater flow in CGM would generally increase, with a trend of increasing at first and then decreasing like the streamflow. However, the amount of annual groundwater flow in WW would suffer continuous decreases, with greater degrees under high radiative forcing levels due to more evapotranspiration. Changes in the hydrological process would alter the original mechanisms of sediment delivery for erosion in CGM and WW, which are discussed in the next section.</p>
