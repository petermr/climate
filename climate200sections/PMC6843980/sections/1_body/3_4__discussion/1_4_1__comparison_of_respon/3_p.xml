<p>Based on the model outputs for various climate change scenarios during two future periods of the 2050s and 2070s, the amount of annual streamflow in CGM would generally increase and go through a process of increasing firstly and then decreasing. However, there was no consistent increasing trend for the amount of annual streamflow in WW, with several decreases under scenarios of high radiative forcing levels. In CGM, the streamflow would increase in the 2050s for all scenarios, among which RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 would increase more. In the 2070s, the streamflow would decrease compared to the values in the 2050s for all scenarios except RCP 2.6, which was still at the level of the 2050s. There were significantly negative effects on the streamflow under high radiative forcing conditions in the 2070s, i.e., the higher the radiative forcing levels, the less the streamflow. For the scenario of RCP 8.5 in the 2070s, the streamflow would return to the baseline level even if the precipitation increased by 15.1%, which was offset by the intense increase in evapotranspiration due to higher temperature. In WW, the streamflow in the 2050s would decrease under the medium radiative forcing levels of RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0, but slightly increase for the scenarios of RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. In the 2070s, the streamflow would decrease except RCP 4.5, which increased by 5.2% relative to the baseline level. The decrease in streamflow under RCP 6.0 was most significant, decreasing by 4.7% in the 2050s and 7.9% in the 2070s. The negative effect on streamflow under RCP 2.6 was the lowest, with an increase of 3.0% in the 2050s and a decrease of 0.9% in the 2070s.</p>
