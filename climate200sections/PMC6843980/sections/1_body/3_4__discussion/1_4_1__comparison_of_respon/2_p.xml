<p>The streamflow yields in WW were higher than those in CGM, indicating a better water conservation capacity of woodland than cultivated field in the study area. From the point of view of average annual yields per unit area, the streamflow in WW was approximately 3.5 times that of the streamflow in CGM for the baseline status, while the average annual precipitation in WW was only approximately 1.4 times that of the precipitation in CGM. The streamflow was composed of runoff and groundwater. On one hand, the runoff in WW was slightly higher than that in CGM, but generally of the same order of magnitude. The variation in runoff in CGM was greater than that in WW. For each group of annual runoff samples under the same period and weather conditions, the mean values in CGM were higher than the median values, while the mean and median values in WW were always on the same level. This meant that there were more extreme events with high runoff yields in CGM, which indicated a poor capacity of cultivated field as a buffer facing intense rainfall. On the other hand, there was obviously more groundwater yield in WW than in CGM. The groundwater flow in WW was nearly four times that of the groundwater in CGM, which accounted for the main source of more streamflow in WW than CGM. The woodland underlying surface was of benefit for rainwater infiltration to recharge the unsaturated zone, and the saturated zone had better water storage capacity for less water losses from leakage and/or seepage processes. However, the great rainwater blocking capacity of woodland also provided more available moisture in soil for evapotranspiration. The evapotranspiration in WW was more than 4.5 times that of the evapotranspiration in CGM. The differences in potential evapotranspiration capacity between CGM and WW are one of the most important factors leading to different responses of streamflow to different hotter and wetter climate change scenarios.</p>
