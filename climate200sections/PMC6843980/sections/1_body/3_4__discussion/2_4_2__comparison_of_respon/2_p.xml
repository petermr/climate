<p>The results of the model scenario analysis showed that there were significantly more erosion and sediment yield in CGM than WW, indicating better soil and water conservation capacities of the woodland surface. The erosion was directly created by rainfall with different intensities in different land use areas. It can be seen as a source reservoir of sediment available to be delivered. A part of erosion was transferred by runoff to generate the sediment yield in the water body. The amount of annual erosion yields per unit area in CGM was 4.4 times that of the erosion in WW for the baseline status, implying poorer soil-fixing capacity in the cultivated field. However, the average annual sediment in CGM was only 2.2 times that of the sediment in WW, implying a higher delivery ratio of erosion in woodland. The greater sediment transport capacity of woodland mainly resulted from its higher runoff yields.</p>
