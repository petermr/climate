 <caption> The potential effects of changes in oxygen level on predator–prey interactions, based on fish as prey, and fish or an endotherm (air breathing) as predators (e.g. bird), based on a scenario of future hypoxia. Downwards and upwards arrow indicate a decrease and an increase, respectively; while a ≈ sign indicates no significant change. When oxygen decreases, fish prey decreases their metabolism and growth, and their general conditions. This can have a negative impact on their locomotor and sensory performance. In addition to this indirect effect, hypoxia can also decrease escape performance directly (particularly non-locomotor performance). Hypoxia can also affect the conditions (growth and metabolism) of fish predator, but have no effect on endotherm, air-breathing predators such as birds. Similarly to fish prey, decreased conditions can impact the attack performance of fish predators, in addition to the direct (potential) effect of hypoxia on their performance in general. In addition, hypoxia-dependant decrease in metabolism decreases hunger level (thus motivation to feed and search activity) in fish predators, but not in birds. A possible scenario in fish–fish interactions is that the performance of both predators and prey decreases in hypoxia, and so does hunger level in predators. This could result in a decreased frequency of predator–prey events. On the other hand, birds could take advantage of the lower performance of fish prey in hypoxia, thus increasing their success rate in capturing a prey. </caption>
