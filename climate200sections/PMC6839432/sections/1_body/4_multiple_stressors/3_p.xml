<p>An important step towards understanding the impact of climate change at the community level is to explore predator–prey interactions from the perspective of both participants at the same time. Only one study has examined both the responses of the prey and the predator to combined future stressors. Allan and colleagues exposed newly settled damselfish (
 <italic>P. wardi</italic>) and predatory dottybacks (
 <italic>P. fuscus</italic>) to control or elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> (~405 and 930 μatm) and temperature (27 and 30°C) conditions for 7 days in a 2 × 2 design. Detailed examination of the interaction between predator and prey found that high temperature had an overwhelming effect on the escape behaviour of the prey (i.e. on reaction distance, ALT, escape distance, but not escape speed) compared with the combined exposure to elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and high temperature (significant interaction effect on escape speed), or the independent effect of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> (which affected only escape speed) (

 <sub>2</sub> on the behaviour of the predator, emphasizing the species specificity of the response to elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the pressing requirement to examine fish escape responses in an ecological context within future climate scenarios (
