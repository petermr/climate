<p>Single stressor experiments are typical of the early stages in the development of a research field, but these are soon followed by increasingly complex, multi-factorial experiments that attempt to incorporate additional layers of reality into the artificiality of manipulative experiments. Such experiments allow us to explore whether the stressors combine to yield additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects on the variables measured. To date, climate change experiments in the context of escape responses have been rare and involved binary combinations of stressors to mimic future environmental scenarios. The most commonly used combination of stressors has been water temperature and elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels. Previous meta-analyses have found that the interactions of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> or hypoxia with elevated water temperature lead to synergistic effects on a range of physiological and life history characters (
