<p>Increased environmental fluctuations and climate change are posing major challenges to marine organisms. Climate change can affect their relative abundance and distribution as a result of their different physiological tolerances (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>). This is largely because in addition to affecting the physiology and performance of a given species, climate change is also likely to affect the relationship between species (
