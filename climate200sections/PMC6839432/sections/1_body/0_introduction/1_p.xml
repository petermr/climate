<p>A rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide combined with anthropogenic pollutants is causing major changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean, with major impacts on its inhabitants. Climate change models project that ocean 
 <italic>p</italic>CO
 <sub>2</sub> will exceed 900 ppm by 2100 (
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>) from current levels of ~ 400 ppm, leading to a decrease in ocean pH. Elevation of this primary greenhouse gas will also lead to a predicted 3–5°C increase in ocean temperatures over the same time period. The temperature dependence of chemical reactions means that levels of available oxygen within the shallow ocean will decrease, particularly when combined with increased levels of nutrient discharge along the shores and eutrophication (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>), and these have already led to an increase in the size and number of hypoxic zones in coastal and oceanic waters. In the aquatic environment, global warming, ocean acidification (OA) and hypoxia are intrinsically linked with each other and with an array of other stressors (e.g. heavy metals, plastics, petrol chemicals) that are predicted to increase over time due to accelerating global economies (

 </xref>). Global warming can increase the release of CO
 <sub>2</sub> from terrestrial and marine sinks, thereby creating a positive feedback causing a further increase in temperatures (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). Similarly, global warming is contributing to deoxygenation, as a result of a decrease in oxygen solubility and an increase in oxygen consumption in marine organisms (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). OA is predicted to be amplified by hypoxia in coastal areas, where much higher 
 <italic>p</italic>CO
 <sub>2</sub> values than predicted for other areas of the ocean can be expected, because of the production of CO
 <sub>2</sub> related to heterotrophic degradation of organic material (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Furthermore, although the levels of each of these three fundamental stressors is known to show a natural daily and seasonal variation (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>), the extent of their variation is predicted to increase, particularly for CO
