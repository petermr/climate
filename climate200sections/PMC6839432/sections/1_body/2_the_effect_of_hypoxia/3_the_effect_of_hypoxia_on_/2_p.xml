 </xref> suggest that the duration of the exposure to hypoxia (i.e. chronic versus acute stress) may have a role in determining the behavioural response of fishes, although this is species specific. For example, grass carp (
 <italic>Ctenopharyngodon idellus</italic>) showed a decrease in maximum escape velocity only in normoxia-acclimated fish exposed to hypoxia, while no change was observed when fish were reared in similar hypoxic conditions (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Ackerly and colleagues acclimated the African mormyrid (
 <italic>Marcusenius victoria</italic>) for 8 weeks to high and low dissolved oxygen (i.e. 20% of air saturation) before their escape swimming was tested under both these normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The results showed that the hypoxia-acclimated fish had shorter escape displacement when tested under hypoxia than in normoxia, while displacement of normoxia-acclimated fish was not affected by the test condition (

 <italic>Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae</italic>) (
 <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Gotanda 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Fish reared during at least 10 months in 15% air saturation-hypoxia developed larger gills, deeper bodies, and larger, wider heads than fish reared in normoxia. While different body morphologies could potentially have an effect on swimming performance, hypoxia-reared fish showed no difference in maximum velocity or acceleration compared to normoxia-reared fish. 
 <xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">Gotanda 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)
 </xref> suggest that hypoxia-reared fish might compensate for morphological differences by using a high proportion of double-bend responses, to achieve similar performance as normoxia-reared fish. Overall, these results show that the effect of hypoxia on fish escape locomotion (i) is species specific, with some species showing decreased performance in hypoxia while other species show no effect; (ii) depends on acclimation and rearing conditions, with acclimation potentially allowing fish to partially compensate for exposure to hypoxic conditions in some cases; and (iii) may be affected by access to the water surface.
