<p>In escaping golden grey mullet (
 <italic>Liza aurata</italic>), cumulative distance and maximum swimming speeds were found to be reduced following a few hours of exposure to acute hypoxia (
 <xref rid="ref105" ref-type="bibr">Lefrançois 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). This decreased escape performance was observed in severe hypoxia (i.e. 10% of air saturation) only when access to the surface was impeded experimentally. On the other hand, when 
 <italic>L. aurata</italic> had access to the surface, they performed aquatic surface respiration (ASR, which allows fish to breath at the oxygenated layer near the air–water interface) and their performance did not differ from that of fish in normoxia (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). From a kinematic perspective, decreased escape swimming performance in this species was related to a decreased proportion of double bend responses, i.e. escape responses consisting of stages 1 and 2 (i.e. the first two body bends in an escape response, 
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Domenici and Blake, 1997</xref>), as opposed to single bend responses in which only one body bend was observed and therefore lower speed (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Work on other species, however, did not find a significant effect of similarly acute hypoxia exposure on escape locomotion in European seabass (
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) (
 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Lefrancois and Domenici, 2006</xref>) or crucian carp (
 <italic>C. carassius</italic>) (
