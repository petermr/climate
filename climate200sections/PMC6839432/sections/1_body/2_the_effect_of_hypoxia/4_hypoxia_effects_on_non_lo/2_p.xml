<p>Functionally, the hypoxia-related reduction in responsiveness may be due to an increase in response threshold, and/or decreased motivation to escape related to stress and exhaustion (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>). Although most species investigated showed a decrease in responsiveness when exposed to hypoxia, the African mormyrid (
 <italic>Marcusenius victoria</italic>) showed no effect when exposed to acute or chronic hypoxia, suggesting that the species-specific differences in hypoxia tolerance are an important factor (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Species-specific difference were also found in the latency of the escape response; escape latency was not affected by hypoxia in 
 <italic>L. aurata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. labrax</italic>, while it increased in
