<p>In fish escape responses, non-locomotor variables such as responsiveness, timing and response distances are known to affect vulnerability to predation (
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010a</xref>). This is particularly relevant for the effect of hypoxia, because of the decreased brain and sensory performance in hypoxia observed in fish and other vertebrates (

 <xref rid="ref154" ref-type="bibr">Robinson 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Hypoxia was found to reduce the responsiveness to a startling stimulus in both 
 <italic>D. labrax</italic> and 
 <italic>L. aurata</italic> exposed to an acute decrease of oxygen whether this latter species had access to the surface or not (

 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Lefrancois and Domenici, 2006</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in the common sole (

 <xref rid="ref199" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>) and white grunts (

 <xref rid="ref158" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez-García 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Because responsiveness is a fundamental component of escape performance (
 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Fuiman 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>), a decrease in responsiveness such as that observed in hypoxia may increase the risk of mortality and is expected to influence the outcome of predator–prey interactions.
