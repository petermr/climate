<p>Modelling the effects of changes in temperature, oxygen and CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels on predator–prey interactions is a challenging but a much needed task in order to increase our predictive ability of the ecological effects of climate change. The importance of these effects in shaping marine communities is highlighted by the differential outcomes that climate change may have on various species and taxa of predators and prey (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>) and metabolically (

 </xref>;

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). A promising avenue to gain predictive power on the ecological effects of climate change is that of focusing on the more obvious differences between various taxa of predators and prey. Endotherms and ectotherms will respond differently to climate change, and whether they are predators or prey will have consequences for the outcome of interactions that will affect the patterns of species abundance and community composition, with high relevance for conservation and mitigation strategies (

 </xref>). Similarly, how body size may modulate the effect of climate change (e.g. small fish may be more hypoxia tolerant than large fish) (
 <xref rid="ref132" ref-type="bibr">Pan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>) is an interesting area for future research. Furthering our understanding of how climate change stressors affect escape responses in fish of different species and sizes is a fundamental step to scale up to predator–prey interactions and their consequences at the community level.
