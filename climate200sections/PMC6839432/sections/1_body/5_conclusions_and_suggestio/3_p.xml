<p>Empirical studies on various taxa that have been sampled across a species geographic range have shown that sensitivity to elevated CO

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Their analysis found that when a third stressor was added to an experiment, it changed interaction effects in two-thirds of the experiments and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. It is likely that future meta-analyses of the influence of stressors on escape response and predator–prey interactions in general will find similar levels of complex interactive effects.
