<p>To date, there are only a few studies that have examined the effects of CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure on both predator and prey attack and escape responses. 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>etÂ al.</italic> (2013)
 </xref> found that although elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> had no effect on predator attack speed, the distance at which the predators started to strike at the prey was affected following high CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure (
 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting an effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on motivation to feed. However, this effect differed depending on whether the prey had also been exposed to high CO
 <sub>2</sub>. A functional interpretation of the effects of CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure on predators is challenging because their response is a combination of their motivation to attack and the behaviour of the prey and because the neural mechanisms underpinning predatory attacks have not been studied as extensively as those for escape responses (
