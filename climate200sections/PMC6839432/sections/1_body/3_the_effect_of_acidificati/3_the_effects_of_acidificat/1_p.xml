<p>The most significant impact of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure on escape responses appears to be related to the sensory performance that underpins successful escapes. If we consider the initial phase of a predator–prey interaction, which is often triggered by a visual cue, any process that alters this can alter the outcome of the interaction. High CO
 <sub>2</sub> is known to affect the performance of various sensory channels including vision (
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Draper and Weissburg, 2019</xref>). For example, Chung and colleagues found that retinal flicker frequency was disrupted in the spiny damselfish (
 <italic>Acanthochromis polyacanthus</italic>) after a 6–7-day exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> (~900 μatm) (
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Chung 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>), which could have an impact on the ability of prey to visually detect approaching threats and the distance at which it responds to a high-speed predatory attack. Once an attack is perceived, the most important trait associated with a successful escape response is the reaction distance of the prey. 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)

 <sub>2</sub> exposure appears to reduce this distance as well as cause changes in ALT (

 <italic>P. amboinensis</italic> attacked by real predators, leading to increased mortality (
 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), although work based on predator–prey encounters using a different species from the same genus (
 <italic>P. wardi</italic>) showed no effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on either reaction distance or ALT (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Work using a mechanical stimulus showed that exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> negatively affected two fundamental traits of escape response, directionality and responsiveness, but had no effect on escape latency (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). Marine medaka (
 <italic>Oryzias melastigma</italic>) larvae showed no effect on escape latency but did exhibit a lower responsiveness to a mechano-sensory stimuli when reared in high CO
 <sub>2</sub> compared to larvae reared under control conditions (
 <xref rid="ref186" ref-type="bibr">Wang 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Wang and colleagues suggest that lower responsiveness in high CO
 <sub>2</sub> may be due to an effect on the development of the ear (e.g. otoliths), the afferent connections in the VIIIth nerve and the inputs to the Mauthner cells.
