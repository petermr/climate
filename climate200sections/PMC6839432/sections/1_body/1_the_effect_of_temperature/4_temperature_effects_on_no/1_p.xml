<p>Temperature affects various non-locomotor components of the escape response, such as responsiveness, escape latency, reaction distance and directionality from the threat. Temperature has been known to affect escape latency, mainly as a result of the changes in the neural conduction speed, with the highest conduction speed occurring at high temperatures. Fish acclimated for 2 weeks at different temperatures, i.e. 5–25°C (
 <xref rid="ref189" ref-type="bibr">Webb, 1978</xref>) and 15–25°C (
 <xref rid="ref137" ref-type="bibr">Penghan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>), showed shorter escape latencies at higher temperature. Szabo and colleagues acclimated goldfish (
 <italic>C. auratus</italic>) for 4 weeks at 5, 15 or 25°C and found that the higher temperature yielded the shorter latencies, suggesting that these effects were due, at least in part, to higher conduction velocity in the Mauthner axons of warm-acclimated populations (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Furthermore, acclimation to high temperature was found to increase responsiveness, likely because fish became hyper-excitable as a result of a change in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Although higher temperature may increase both responsiveness and the latency performance of fish, other escape traits such as directionality (the proportion of escape responses away from the threat) may be impaired (

 <xref rid="ref174" ref-type="bibr">Szabo 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)
 </xref> suggest that decreased directionality was due to the higher conduction velocity resulting from high temperature in warm-acclimated population, which may reduce the temporal separation of inputs to the two Mauthner cells, causing reduced right–left discrimination. In contrast, work based on acute cooling found that low temperatures increase responsiveness and decreased directionality (i.e. by increasing the proportion of responses towards the threat) in goldfish (
 <italic>C. auratus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="ref146" ref-type="bibr">Preuss and Faber, 2003</xref>). These studies show that acute cooling lowered the behavioural threshold for spike initiation in the Mauthner cell, presumably because of changes in the intrinsic properties of the Mauthner cells (
 <xref rid="ref146" ref-type="bibr">Preuss and Faber, 2003</xref>). Similarly, acute warming (34–39°C) was found to decrease the reaction distance in goldfish (
 <italic>C. auratus</italic>) to an approaching threat compared to the control level (15°C), likely as a result of the malfunctioning of the neurosensory system (
