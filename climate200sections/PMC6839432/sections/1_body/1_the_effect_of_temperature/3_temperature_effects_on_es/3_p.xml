<p>Furthermore, increasing temperature can directly affect escape response by reducing the viscosity of water. In order to partition the effect of temperature into those due to change in viscosity and those due to effect on fish physiology, experiments on escape responses have been carried out by changing the viscosity of the water. Work on various species has shown that the effect of viscosity may be relevant for the escape swimming of small larvae at lower temperatures, while for larger larvae and higher temperatures, the effect of temperature on fish physiology is the main factor driving changes in swimming performance (

 </xref>). Viscosity was found to have an overall effect on the escape response kinematics of larval zebrafish (
 <italic>Brachydanio rerio</italic>) (3.3 mm in body length), by significantly decreasing displacement, maximum velocity and acceleration during stage 1 (i.e. the first muscle contraction) of the escape response; however, the viscosity values used were outside the range of viscosity variation caused by temperature changes in nature (
