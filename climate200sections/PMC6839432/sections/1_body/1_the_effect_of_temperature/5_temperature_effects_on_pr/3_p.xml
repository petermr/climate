<p>Other studies also suggest that temperature can affect not only locomotor performance but also the predator’s motivation to attack prey. Using 1 month of acclimation, 
 <xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">Grigaltchik 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2012)
 </xref> showed that warm acclimated bass (
 <italic>Macquaria novemaculeata</italic>) had higher attack rates on mosquitofish (
 <italic>Gambusia holbrooki</italic>) than cold acclimated ones, and higher prey capture success. Interestingly, laboratory trials showed that the burst swimming performances of acclimated seabass did not differ between warm and cold temperatures, indicating that muscle function was maintained through acclimation, thus low capture rates at low temperature were likely to be due to decreased motivation to catch prey as a result of lower food requirement (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Furthermore, when tested at a temperature higher than the acclimation range, attack rates declined, while the escape swimming performance of the prey was higher than the attack speed of the predators. Therefore, in some predator–prey pairs, predator pressure may increase with temperature up to a point, and then it may decline again (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>), although this pattern will be modulated by acclimation time. A similar pattern was found in the relationship between temperature and strike rate of common coral trout (
 <italic>Plectropomus leopardus</italic>), from the Great Barrier Reef (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Hence, differences in the thermal reaction norms of performance and physiology between prey and predator will affect the outcome of interactions in response to temperature change.
