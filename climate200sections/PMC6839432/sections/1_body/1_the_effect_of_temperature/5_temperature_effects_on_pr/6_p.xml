<p>Overall, these studies suggest that temperature is a major factor determining the outcome of predator–prey interactions with fish as prey, although the type of change, and therefore, the potential future scenario will depend largely on whether the predators involved are endotherm or ectotherm (

Acclimation may in part compensate for the effect of temperature on some aspects of performance, although motivational components on the predator’s part appear to be a key element of the interactions. In addition, such complex interactions, in which motivational, sensory and locomotor factors can play a role, are unlikely to be driven by a single temperature effect. Regardless of the functional explanation for the effect on predator–prey interactions and the extent to which it is due to changes in escape or attack swimming, sensory performance, differences in predator hunger levels or a combination of all of these factors, studies of predator–prey interactions can be fundamental for predicting tipping points in the responses of ecosystems to global warming (
