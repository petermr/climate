<p>In addition, while previous work shows that climate change stressors can have a number of effects on escape performance and therefore on prey vulnerability, further important effects of climate change (e.g. warming) may impact other aspects of swimming (e.g. aerobic swimming), which can trade off with anaerobic swimming (
