<p>Given all the effects that temperature can have on escape locomotion and behaviour, temperature is expected to modulate the outcome of predator–prey interactions. Species-specific differences, the duration of temperature acclimation, as well as the differences in temperature between the experimental treatments may modulate these effects. Because predators and prey may respond differently to climate change, the consequent impact on their interactions may have profound effects on population dynamics (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). They may also indirectly affect the outcome of predator–prey encounters because temperature has a well-known effect on metabolism of the predators, with metabolic scope increasing with temperature up to an optimum, beyond which a decline is observed (
