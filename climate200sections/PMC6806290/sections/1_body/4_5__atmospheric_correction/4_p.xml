<p>System Vicarious Calibration (SVC) is recognised as a key element of the ocean-colour processing to reach the requirements of Climate Data Record: radiometric uncertainty less than 5% in the blue and green spectral regions [
 <xref rid="B40-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This consists in the calibration of the system comprising both the sensor (Level 1B data) and the Level 2 processing chain through the combination of i) high-quality sea-truth water-leaving radiance and ii) atmospheric models used in the atmospheric correction process [
 <xref rid="B41-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For L2Gen processing, the SVC gains were the ones provided by NASA following the Franz et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] approach, based on measurements of the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY, Clark et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) at each of the sensor bands. For POLYMER processing, this standard approach could not be applied because of the spectrally coupled inversion of the whole spectrum. The SVC gains for POLYMER were set to unity for all spectral bands in the initial v1 processing. The POLYMER gains in the subsequent versions were computed by a dedicated method developed in the OC-CCI project [
 <xref rid="B44-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This method computes the SVC gains by minimizing the discrepancy between the MOBY data and the POLYMER retrieval at sea level, implicitly taking into account the spectral constraints of the marine and atmospheric models embedded in the atmospheric correction procedure.
