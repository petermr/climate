<p>For the spatial and temporal resolutions of the chlorophyll product, there were various requirements depending on the user type (remote-sensing scientists or modellers) and on the geographic scope of research (global or regional). Accordingly, spatial resolution requirements ranged from 1 km or less for the remote-sensing scientists to 1

 </inline-formula> for some modellers. Temporal requirements ranged from daily to monthly for both groups. In addition, users emphasised the importance of having uncertainty or error characteristics associated with each product. They also identified the need for sufficient stability in the products over the long term, necessary to distinguish between real trends in the data from artefacts introduced by lack of stability in data (e.g., 1â€“2% for chlorophyll-a concentration over 10 years).
