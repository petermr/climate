<p>Phytoplankton consume carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, being responsible for cycling some 50 GT of carbon globally on an annual scale [
 <xref rid="B2-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are also important players in the cycling of other elements in the ocean, including nitrogen, silica, and iron [
 <xref rid="B3-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Phytoplankton are understood to impact atmospheric processes such as formation of aerosols through complex pathways [

 <xref rid="B8-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Phytoplankton absorb sunlight and are therefore implicated in modulating the distribution of heat in the surface layer of the ocean and, hence, in the airâ€“sea exchanges of energy [

 <xref rid="B10-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because of these important processes, there is an imperative to monitor their dynamics at the global scale, with high resolution in time and space. Remote sensing of ocean colour provides our only window into phytoplankton dynamics and into the pelagic ecosystem on synoptic scales, hence its characterisation as revolutionary.
