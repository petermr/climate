<p>For both the atmospheric-correction and in-water inter-comparisons, the performance of the candidate processors and algorithms was evaluated using a suite of statistical tests commonly used in comparisons between modelled and in situ data [
 <xref rid="B38-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For comparisons of algorithms, these statistical tests were employed to develop an objective methodology designed to rank the quantitative performance of the candidate algorithms and processors. The objective methodology differed slightly with respect to the in-water and atmospheric-correction comparisons due to differences in the number of algorithms tested, differences in the number and types of variables, and inherent differences in the implementation of atmospheric-correction and in-water algorithms, details of which can be found in MÃ¼ller et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Brewin et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The comparisons were designed to rank the performance of the algorithms objectively and have the potential to be implemented routinely, such that the performance of emerging algorithms could be compared with that of earlier algorithms. Such systematic comparisons could be helpful to identify more suitable algorithms as they emerged.
