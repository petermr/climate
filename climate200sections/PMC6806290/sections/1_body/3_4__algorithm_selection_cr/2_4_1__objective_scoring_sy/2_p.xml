<p>Whereas the round-robin comparison treated the atmospheric correction processors and in-water algorithms separately, both approaches were based on similar quantitative and qualitative assessments of algorithm performance. The quantitative criteria for the assessment of atmospheric correction processors and in-water algorithms are described in detail in Müller et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Brewin et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], respectively. The semi-quantitative assessment conducted to test the homogeneity of products over the full swath of a satellite image and the dependencies of the atmospheric correction processors on the satellite viewing geometry (angular dependencies) are described in Müller et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These are summarised below.
