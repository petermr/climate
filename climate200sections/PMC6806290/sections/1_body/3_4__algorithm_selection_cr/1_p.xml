<p>A comprehensive set of criteria was established for selection of atmospheric-correction processors and of in-water bio-optical algorithms, as described in Brewin et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], Müller et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and Müller et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The criteria included a quantitative assessment and a qualitative assessment of the suitability of algorithms for climate studies [
 <xref rid="B21-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The quantitative assessment consisted of a comparison of algorithm outputs with corresponding in situ data for both the in-water algorithms and the atmospheric correction processors. Furthermore, the homogeneity of angular dependencies (i.e., dependency on viewing geometry) of the various atmospheric correction processors was also studied.
