 <caption>
  <p>Schematic diagram showing how fuzzy-logic-based optical classification is used to propagate uncertainties in OC-CCI products on a per-pixel basis: From v3 onwards, optical classification has also been used to estimate chlorophyll concentration according to optical classes [
   <xref rid="B66-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Note that this method could be extended to all products, provided sufficient data were available in each optical class for adequate uncertainty characterisation.
