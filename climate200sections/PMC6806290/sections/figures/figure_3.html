 <caption> Schematic diagram showing how fuzzy-logic-based optical classification is used to propagate uncertainties in OC-CCI products on a per-pixel basis: From v3 onwards, optical classification has also been used to estimate chlorophyll concentration according to optical classes [ 66]. Note that this method could be extended to all products, provided sufficient data were available in each optical class for adequate uncertainty characterisation. </caption>
