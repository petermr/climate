Although there are many challenges to modelling agricultural CC adaptation, it is unclear whether these are novel or, whether adaptation merely adds new motivations to old challenges. Here, qualitative analysis of modellers&#x02019; views revealed three categories of challenge: Content, Use, and Capacity. Triangulation of findings with reviews of agricultural modelling and Climate Change Risk Assessment was then used to highlight challenges specific to modelling adaptation. These were refined through literature review, focussing attention on how the progressive nature of CC affects the role and impact of modelling. Specific challenges identified were: Scope of adaptations modelled, Information on future adaptation, Collaboration to tackle novel challenges, Optimisation under progressive change with thresholds, and Responsibility given the sensitivity of future outcomes to initial choices under progressive change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Modelling plays a key role in adapting agriculture to climate change.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Modellers' views and literature were analysed to identify adaptation-specific issues.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Novel challenges to modelling climate change adaptation were explored.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Challenges related to Responsibility, Scope, Optimisation, Information, Collaboration.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Adaptation to progressive climate change highlights social impacts of model use.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Agricultural modelling</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Research challenges</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Agriculture must feed a growing world population and deliver essential ecosystem services, while providing economic, social, and cultural value (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Howden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Thornton, 2010</xref>). Ensuring that the sector adapts effectively to the multi-faceted impacts of climate change (CC) (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Iglesias and Garrote, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Olesen, 2017</xref>) is therefore vital. Proactive adaptation undertaken today is likely to be less costly and more effective in reducing the societal impacts of CC than delayed or reactive responses (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Stern, 2007</xref>). However, there is uncertainty around essential knowledge regarding CC impacts at local level (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Diogo et al., 2017</xref>) and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies under different future scenarios (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mandryk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Schaap et al., 2013</xref>). Such strategies interact with a range of wider societal concerns, including the need to achieve sustainable development goals (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhary et al., 2018</xref>), mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Del Prado et al., 2013</xref>), safeguard ecosystem services (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hamidov et al., 2018</xref>), ensure food security (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Godfray et al., 2010</xref>) and avoid damaging land use change (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Foley et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Modelling is a key tool for characterising the likely environmental, economic, and social impact of CC on agricultural systems but, to reflect reality, models must incorporate adaptive responses to these impacts (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). Models need to incorporate adaptation to test the effectiveness of adaptive responses and reveal synergies and trade-offs between adaptation to CC and other objectives (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Del Prado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2008</xref>). In relation to any specific modelled system, CC adaptations can be autonomous (responses occurring without external intervention) or, non-autonomous (planned actions taken pre-emptively or due to experience of CC impacts) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). For example, in a regional scale model, autonomous adaptation might include predicted responses of farmers to environmental change (such as altering sowing dates) while a policy decision to fund irrigation systems might be a non-autonomous adaptation investigated by altering model inputs. In addition, modelling strategies investigated as potential CC adaptations might include responses to non-climatic systemic pressures with adaptive or maladaptive consequences (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gr&#x000fc;neis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mitter et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of this study, CC adaptation is defined as including: non-autonomous adaptations, any strategy explored by modellers as a potential CC adaptation, and autonomous human adaptations. Autonomous biophysical responses of the system, and actions not recognised as CC adaptations within a specific modelling exercise, are considered to be part of the context within which CC adaptation occurs.</p><p id="p0045">The literature on agricultural modelling of CC impacts and adaptive responses is vast and growing (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Challinor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;zkan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;tter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler and Reynolds, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), with diversity in scope and focus. This complexity makes it hard to unpick the nature of the modelling challenges. The question arises as to whether efforts to model CC impacts and to improve agricultural modelling in general, are sufficient to support adaptive actions by stakeholders and policymakers or, whether there are agricultural modelling challenges specific to CC adaptation and thus requiring focussed attention from researchers and modellers. The aim of the current study was to search for and (if found) define challenges specific to CC adaptation modelling in agriculture. Research was based on the gathering and analysis of agricultural modellers&#x02019; views of challenges to modelling agricultural CC adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="p0050">The study proceeded in three stages: i) modelling challenges were identified by modellers within workshops and analysed to identify challenge themes and categories, ii) findings were triangulated by comparing the identified themes with modelling challenges described in existing reviews. This process was used to validate the workshop data and to identify themes likely to include elements specific to modelling CC adaptation, iii) the subset of challenges considered to have CC adaptation specific aspects was considered in the light of a review of the wider literature on CC adaptation, to highlight those novel elements.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Identifying challenge themes and categories</title><p id="p0055">Two workshops were held to understand and explore modellers' views on the challenges to modelling CC adaptation, bringing together researchers from across the Modelling European Agriculture with Climate Change for Food Security (MACSUR) knowledge hub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://macsur.eu" id="intref0010">http://macsur.eu</ext-link>). The workshops engaged 22 modellers from 21 institutes across 11 European countries, with participants representing a purposive sample of agricultural modellers with a specific interest in modelling CC adaptation (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Yin, 1989</xref>). Within this sample, 16 agricultural modelling groups were represented (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>) from across crop, grassland, livestock farm-scale and economic modelling disciplines. Workshops gathered participants&#x02019; views through two structured discussions in which attendees were asked to map adaptation strategies for agriculture and related modelling challenges. Participants were asked what the challenges to modelling climate change adaptation were. They recorded their ideas on sticky notes (one challenge per note) to reduce bias towards the views of vocal participants which can arise in group discussions (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kitzinger, 1995</xref>). Notes were collected and reviewed by the group to remove duplicates, clarify unclear contributions, and give participants a chance to add further ideas after considering the question during the session and in the light of other responses.</p><p id="p0060">Data (responses recorded by participants on sticky notes) were analysed following a grounded-theory approach using thematic coding (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>). Grounded theory seeks to draw information from data, rather than fitting them to a pre-conceived categorisation. Themes in the data are identified by thematic coding, for example, identifying that several contributions relate to data quality. Themes are then compared and contrasted to identify underlying characteristics linking them into broader categories relevant to the research question. In this way, categories are grounded in (derived from) the original data, ensuring relevance and openness to emerging issues (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Charmaz, 2014</xref>). Qualitative approaches have been widely used to investigate the views, perspectives and characteristics of agricultural stakeholders (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mitter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2017</xref>) but, to a lesser extent to explore agricultural research processes themselves. Exceptions include <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al. (2014)</xref> who used a grounded-theory approach to identify key principles of knowledge exchange in environmental management, and <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kipling and &#x000d6;zkan et al. (2016)</xref> who analysed questionnaire data to reveal discourses underlying the perspectives of agricultural modellers on the challenges to communication with stakeholders. These examples demonstrate the practical value of grounded theory in revealing underlying patterns in complex topics.</p><p id="p0065">After the identification of themes through coding of the workshop data, these themes were compared and contrasted to reveal underlying categories with relevance to the research topic (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>). To ensure that the identified categories were robust and properly grounded in the data, results were checked by co-authors not involved in the analysis, following <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bitsch (2005)</xref>. In addition, intermediate findings were presented and discussed at an internal MACSUR project meeting.</p><p id="p0070">An important aspect of grounded theory methodology is to ensure data saturation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2017</xref>) where no new themes or issues arise from the data. To check this, specific modelling challenges were identified in the text of a global review focussed on crop modelling of the impacts of and adaptation to CC (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;tter et al., 2018</xref>). These challenges were coded to ascertain whether any new themes were present, or whether workshop themes were sufficient to accommodate the challenges described (indicating saturation). The article also defined challenges specific to modelling tropical plant production systems, providing a test of whether themes arising from the contributions of European modellers involved in the present study have relevance beyond the region.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Triangulation with previous reviews and the identification of CC adaptation specific challenges</title><p id="p0075">A recent review of challenges for Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) for adaptation policy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al., 2018</xref>) offered a comparison between the data from the current study, and challenges identified within a discipline focussed specifically on CC adaptation, but which encompasses change in all sectors (not only agriculture) and which may, but does not necessarily, draw on modelling. This comparison could therefore, reveal or expand on challenges related to CC adaptation itself that modellers may not have considered. Themes were identified in the review using thematic coding, following the method applied to the data from the workshops (2.1). The themes defined in this process were then compared with the themes derived from the current study to identify similarities and differences. A second set of comparisons were made between workshop data and two recent reviews of modelling challenges in the context of CC; for grassland modelling, and for animal health and disease modelling (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;zkan et al., 2016</xref>). These two articles were chosen as they applied a similar approach to that used here in order to derive the challenges they presented, allowing a straight comparison with the themes identified in the current study. The disciplines of grassland and health and disease modelling lie within the broader agricultural modelling community focussed on in this study, but the reviews reflected on CC in general, only briefly treating CC adaptation. They could therefore be used to reveal which of the challenges from the current study were also wider challenges for modellers, and therefore not specific to CC adaptation modelling. In the context of a wider review of literature on CC adaptation, triangulation of these different comparisons was used to draw out specific CC adaptation challenges for agricultural modelling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Challenges to modelling adaptation</title><p id="p0080">Grounded theory analysis of challenges to modelling adaptation expressed by modellers, identified 18 themes (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref> for full description of each), and three underlying categories: Content, Use, and Capacity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Themes and underlying categories derived from workshop data.

However, many issues raised related to broader modelling challenges. In particular, modelling CC impacts on agriculture is a complex challenge in itself that has been recently reviewed by a number of authors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;zkan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;tter et al., 2018</xref>).

The aim was to highlight challenges with potentially adaptation-specific aspects for further consideration (for full details of themes from the CCRA review and of the comparison, see <xref rid="appsec4" ref-type="sec">Appendix D</xref>). In relation to the category of Capacity in the current study, several themes were found in both modelling and CCRA studies, specifically: <italic>Collaboration</italic>, <italic>Data availability</italic>, <italic>Data quality</italic>, <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> and <italic>Uncertainty</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Challenges identified by modellers relating to resource availability (<italic>Resources for modelling</italic>), and <italic>Data accessibility</italic> (i.e. due to communication and ownership of data rather than due to whether they exist) were not raised in relation to CCRA for adaptation policy. This difference may reflect the very specific data requirements of models, and the fact that agricultural modelling must come together across specific disciplines to incorporate CC adaptation, while CCRA is already a united community explicitly focused on this aim and working in direct support of policy. In general, these two challenge themes are clearly not a specific issue for modelling CC adaptation in agriculture, but broader challenges to model development and application.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of challenges identified by participants with themes drawn from <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al.

There is no CCRA theme that relates to <italic>Discrete events</italic>, except for a reference within the <italic>Collaboration</italic> theme to the benefits of linking to disaster risk management researchers. In relation to <italic>Management modelling</italic>, the CCRA review focused on the specific issue of <italic>Cognitive bias</italic>, and how it affects decision-making.</p><p id="p0130">The biggest differences between the current study and the CCRA review were found in the category of Use of models. Participants in the current study expressed awareness of practical challenges relating to how to improve model relevance (<italic>User focus</italic>), the <italic>Engagement approaches</italic> that modellers need to use, the <italic>Role of modelling</italic> (when and how to engage) and the challenge of effective <italic>Communication</italic> with stakeholders. However, they did not consider how such issues might interact with differing stakeholder limitations and agendas &#x02013; which was highlighted in the CCRA review within several different themes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, A &#x02013; black boxes). These differences in relation to Use, may reflect the different characteristics of modelling versus risk assessment: In a CCRA, data form the core content, with the scope of the assessment and understanding of interactions (biophysical, political and economic, across scales and sectors etc.) explicit in the subsequent interpretation of those data (an issue relating to the capacity to carry out this interpretation). In contrast, in modelling, data are required to develop and use the model (relating to the category &#x02018;Capacity&#x02019;) while scope and understanding of how systems work form the Content of the model. As a result, model outputs may be shared and used by decision makers without these underlying issues (contained within the model) being considered. Interpretation of results becomes a much more contested space within CCRA, with uncertainty and limitations of knowledge interacting with the sometimes conflicting subjective agendas of stakeholders (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al., 2018</xref>). Comparison of the CCRA review and the present study therefore highlights the importance for agricultural CC adaptation modelling of taking better account of ethical issues relating to the presentation of findings, what they include and exclude, and with whom they are shared &#x02013; i.e., issues relating to the diverse motives, perspectives and values of different societal groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.2"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Comparison with modelling reviews</title><p id="p0135">Comparing challenges to grassland modelling and animal health and disease modelling under CC with the workshop data (<xref rid="appsec4" ref-type="sec">Appendix D</xref>) revealed two themes highlighted only in relation to CC adaptation (not as wider challenges to modelling). The first was the development of <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> of future adaption (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> relate to the challenges of model <italic>Scope</italic>, with the difference being between elements of future change provided as model inputs (scenarios) and elements that are endogenous to models (scope). The second theme only arising in relation to CC adaptation was <italic>Management modelling</italic>. However, it is apparent that incorporating all relevant aspects of decision making, including <italic>Cognitive bias</italic>, into models is a general challenge for modellers seeking to represent any form of decision making. Studies of approaches to incorporating management into agricultural models (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Robert et al., 2016</xref>) suggest that technical solutions exist in modelling to characterise adaptation, including constraints and changes that take place over time but, that actually representing proactive management is difficult. The fact that <italic>Management modelling</italic> was not framed as a general challenge in the reviews used in the comparison exercise, may relate to their focus on biophysical challenges, reflecting the implicit nature of decision-making assumptions in biophysical modelling (i.e. as rational responses to biophysical cues with perfect knowledge). This view is reinforced by the consideration in both reviews of <italic>Interactions</italic> between management and biophysical and economic systems, suggesting a greater focus on biophysical impacts and triggers of choices, than on characterisation of the decision-making process itself. Again, although <italic>Interactions</italic> modelling was considered as both a general and an adaptation-specific challenge in the reviews, improving how the <italic>Interactions</italic> of biophysical, economic and management systems are characterised is a general modelling challenge, with only the <italic>Scope</italic> of the systems modelled increasing to facilitate the modelling of novel adaptations. <italic>Data accessibility</italic> was another theme identified as a challenge for both general and CC adaptation modelling in the grassland and livestock health and disease reviews (the need to collate available data on future adaptations). However, overcoming issues of <italic>Data accessibility</italic> (ownership, sharing) is clearly a general challenge for modellers, and no specific elements of it were detailed in the reviews, or the literature.</p><p id="p0140">Taking account of the discussions above, ten of the original challenges were either, not mentioned in the modelling reviews, only mentioned as general challenges to modelling under CC, or were determined to be general after further consideration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, white boxes). A CC adaptation specific element was suggested for three of these (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, A &#x02013; white boxes) as a result of their relation to the CCRA challenges associated with subjective aspects of dealing with stakeholders. Seven more of the original challenges were given both adaptation-specific and wider relevance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, light grey boxes). Determining the precise nature of the adaptation-specific elements within these challenges, required further consideration in the context of understanding from the wider literature, which is the focus of the following section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>Identifying challenges specific to modelling adaptation</title><p id="p0145">The challenges identified in the previous section as having CC adaptation-specific elements, as well as associated themes from the CCRA review (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>., boxes within dashed ovals) are explored below in the light of key characteristics of CC adaptation, in order to focus on the underlying specific issues they present. Climate change differs from most other issues in that it overlays pre-existing socio-economic (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Iglesias and Garrote, 2015</xref>) and environmental challenges, and represents a progressive and sustained change over time. As CC affects the biophysical systems on which we rely in multiple ways, it produces cascades of interacting impacts and feedbacks within and between sectors, making studies of CC issues particularly complex (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Terzi et al., 2019</xref>). So, while other types of change affecting farming may also be progressive (e.g. increasing demand for meat and dairy products, advances in technology) CC is unique as a sustained, progressive change in the biophysical systems that farmers rely on, rather than just in the socio-economic context in which farming takes place. Path dependency in relation to processes of economic and political change over time, including in agricultural systems (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kay, 2003</xref>) (see <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Sunley (2006)</xref> for a critical review) means that our iterative responses to progressive CC may lead us down particular pathways, each with different implications for different societal groups, regions and biophysical systems. For example, investment to install and improve irrigation systems may make increasing crop water supply more cost effective for a farmer than changing towards more water efficient systems as CC advances, with implications for other water users and the environment. In Sardinia, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dono et al. (2016)</xref> found that intensive dairy farming reliant on irrigation systems is likely to be less vulnerable to CC than traditional, low input sheep production reliant on natural water supplies. Therefore, pathways of adaptive response to progressive CC need to be explored in order to facilitate informed and reflective decision making that take such issues into account. In this light, the <italic>Scope</italic> of models to explore the future consequences of CC adaptation strategies is revealed as a CC adaptation-specific element of the workshop theme of <italic>Scope</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, B).</p><p id="p0150">The issue of path dependency is also relevant to the &#x02018;Use of models&#x02019; challenge category. In the literature on CC adaptation, even the need for intervention to ensure agricultural adaptation to CC is contested, with some suggesting that market forces will automatically adjust systems to change, while others argue that progressive CC will require well-planned responses beyond the autonomous, incremental change already undertaken by agricultural stakeholders (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anwar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). Relying on autonomous responses or intervening to completely manage CC adaptation, are two extremes in a continuum of approaches. Which adaptive pathway (different types of planned response or, reliance on autonomous change) appears most favourable depends on chosen system boundaries (e.g. biophysical processes, economic processes, social processes) and the nature of CC change (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>) but, also on desired outcomes and on whose desires are considered. Although profit or production maximising objectives may be assumed in &#x02018;hard systems&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">van Paassen et al., 2007</xref>) research approaches, this assumption has been described as representing an &#x02018;implicit sociology&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jansen, 2009</xref>) of unexplored motives and opinions. If particular motives and objectives for change have already been assumed in a model, this represents a move towards more instrumental engagement with stakeholders (to improve research outcomes or increase the implementation of recommendations) and away from normative engagement (involvement of stakeholders and incorporation of their views and needs as a right) (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2009</xref>). Using <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Freeman's (1984)</xref> classification of affected and affecting stakeholders, this focus shifts attention from those who may be affected by change, towards those that can affect change. In this context, and given that the quantification of information (e.g., in models) is understood to fundamentally alter how things are perceived and valued (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Espeland and Stevens, 2008</xref>) it is important that the aims modellers focus on, what models include, who they are for, and how they are communicated, are critically reflected on by modellers in general. Within the current study, the more normative aspects of the &#x02018;Use of models&#x02019; challenge category reflected awareness among modellers of the potential for models to affect the direction of choices (including adaptive responses) and of how, in some cases, modellers are facing the challenge of assuming new roles, e.g. recognising a &#x0201c;<italic>Paradigm shift in the research praxis: from observer to co-researchers/knowledge brokers</italic>&#x0201d;. Much previous work considers these issues, with recent reviews focussing on best practice in stakeholder involvement, model development, use, and evaluation (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jakeman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Voinov et al., 2016</xref>) including the development of specific engagement processes drawing on understanding of &#x02018;soft systems&#x02019; approaches (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2015</xref>). However, with pathway dependency in the context of progressive CC, the potential impacts of model findings beyond the implementation of a given modelled choice, add an extra dimension to issues of model use. This additional element can be seen as a CC adaptation-specific challenge to model use.</p><p id="p0155">As discussed above, CC adaptation modellers (including biophysical modellers as well as bio-economic modellers) need to consider how social conflicts, power relations and sectoral interests may influence their work and its use (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Newell and Taylor, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2009</xref>) in the context of progressive CC and escalating adaptive responses. Such considerations enable modellers to recognise the implications of their focus (on which stakeholders, which objectives, which adaptations and which impacts) and to identify ways to ensure that the wider context of non-modelled strategies and impacts is conveyed to stakeholders. This may be carried out by the modellers themselves where they have the required expertise and sufficient resources but, may also be achieved through <italic>Collaboration</italic> with social scientists, to try to avoid unintended consequences arising from the use of model outputs, and to achieve best practice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, E). Taken together, these considerations represent the specific CC adaptation aspects of the challenges of <italic>Communication</italic>, <italic>Engagement approaches</italic>, <italic>Role of modelling</italic> and <italic>User focus</italic> grouped as &#x02018;Responsibilities of modelling under progressive (climate) change&#x02019; in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A).</p><p id="p0160">Related to the progressive nature of CC, and adaptive responses to it, a second key characteristic of CC adaptation was revealed explicitly in workshop data. Modellers expressed the need to better understand and incorporate likely stakeholder choices under progressive CC in which their expectations and experiences of CC evolve over time, distinct from likely responses to other types of change (such as one-off shocks or opportunities to increase efficiency). One participant, for example, highlighted the importance of understanding &#x0201c;<italic>Reasons or other triggers for farmer decisions on the number of cattle they have and the type of grassland management they apply, and the point when they begin to care about climate change and take action</italic>&#x0201d;. Addressing this issue, which contributes to the adaptation-specific elements &#x02018;Optimisation&#x02019; and &#x02018;Information&#x02019; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) of challenge themes in groups C and D in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, requires the development of CC adaptation scenarios which are relevant to likely future conditions, and which provide data about the context of decision making and (depending on the type of model) define at least some aspects of decision making itself. Constructing adaptation scenarios is complex, not least because of the issue of path dependency in iterative adaptive responses to progressive CC, discussed above. In addition, choices are likely to be affected by dynamic changes in stakeholder understanding as conditions change (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anwar et al., 2013</xref>). Data for scenarios may come from social science models or, be gathered from stakeholders or experts, and will therefore incorporate <italic>Uncertainty</italic>. In addition, data needed for scenarios includes information on the likely efficacy and impacts of adaptation strategies themselves, which can also be considered to be CC adaptation-specific. Given that participants in the current study highlighted the limitations to the data on adaptation efficacy, including relating to reliance on expert views, <italic>Uncertainty</italic> about the likely effectiveness of CC adaptation strategies can also be considered an adaptation-specific challenge within the cluster of challenges relating to Information available for model development, testing and use (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, D). However, uncertainty relating to models themselves is common to modelling in general, while issues around the quality of data from climate models are important for both adaptation and CC impact modelling (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cammarano et al., 2017</xref>). Scenario development therefore brings together the CC adaptation-specific elements of <italic>Data availability and quality</italic>, <italic>Uncertainty</italic> and <italic>Novel scenarios</italic>, as &#x02018;Information on adaptive responses to progressive change&#x02019; (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, D).</p><p id="p0165">Under progressive CC, the period over which stakeholders seek to optimise systemic outputs is important, as long-term and short-term goals may not align. How this trade-off is viewed is likely to alter with the considered time periods or the assumed pace and certainty of CC (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). This is a specific challenge for CC adaptation modelling with the goal of Optimisation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, C), and represents the CC adaptation-specific aspect of <italic>Dynamic change modelling</italic>. Recent work has started to consider the application of approaches from other disciplines to agricultural settings, in order to build understanding of how changes in the efficacy of CC adaptations over time, and uncertainty in conditions and outcomes, can be incorporated into assessments of adaptation strategies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dittrich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0170">Barriers to inter-disciplinary research collaboration have been well documented (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Siedlok and Hibbert, 2014</xref>) and the need for coordination across disciplines and institutes to tackle CC challenges has been recognised (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Soussana et al., 2012</xref>). Key to challenges A and C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), is <italic>Collaboration</italic> with social scientists with expertise in managing stakeholder engagement (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2014</xref>) and particularly those with expertise in normative and critical engagement approaches. However, inter-disciplinary research communities require time, resources, appropriate structures and the application of specific skillsets to flourish (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Tomassini and Luthi, 2007</xref>). Initiatives such as MACSUR and the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Rosenzweig et al., 2013</xref>) have driven progress in agricultural model development and use (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ewert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e1;ndor et al., 2017</xref>) and supported the application of inter-disciplinary expertise to region-specific CC issues (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dono et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">&#x000d6;zkan G&#x000fc;lzari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000f6;nhart et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0175">The need to characterise a wider range of sometimes transformative adaptations in agricultural models, makes it essential to include, smaller and geographically marginal research groups in inter-disciplinary networks, to capture the diversity of expertise in the research community. These groups are vital to fully leveraging existing expertise, along with &#x02018;core&#x02019; research groups that may find it easier to engage (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Saetnan and Kipling, 2016</xref>). Although differences in context may prevent data on management responses to CC conditions in one location being used as a reliable predictor of change in another (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>), linking local research expertise across regions offers the opportunity to explore novel solutions, cross-pollinating ideas between scientific communities within and between disciplines. The need for integrated modelling approaches to investigate CC impacts and adaptation has been widely recognised (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al., 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;tter et al., 2018</xref>), and the closer involvement of stakeholders in modelling processes is vital to the generation of model outputs with real-world relevance (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bellocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>). The distinct aspect of <italic>Collaboration</italic> for CC adaptation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, E) is therefore the urgency of the need to work together (resulting from the progressive nature of CC) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hallegatte, 2009</xref>), focussing efforts on the specific challenges to agricultural modelling identified above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A-D).</p><p id="p0180">Illustrative reviews of the five CC adaptation-specific modelling challenges identified (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) are provided in <xref rid="appsec4" ref-type="sec">Appendix E</xref>, giving richer descriptions of how they are tackled by specific modelling communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0185">This study sought to answer the question, to what extent is CC adaptation a novel challenge for agricultural modellers? The findings indicate that there are a number of CC adaptation specific aspects to the challenges of adaptation modelling identified by modellers. Within the three challenge categories of Use, Content and Capacity derived from the data, the theme of creating <italic>Novel</italic> (adaptation) <italic>scenarios</italic> was found to be entirely specific to CC adaptation modelling. Seven challenge themes, such as <italic>Resources for modelling</italic> and <italic>Scale interactions</italic>, represented essential pre-requisites for CC adaptation modelling but, were not considered specific to it. Ten other themes were considered general modelling challenges but, with CC adaptation-specific aspects. Most fundamentally, the importance of understanding and managing the influence of model focus, limitations, use and presentation on adaptive responses and their consequences was highlighted for both, bio-economic modellers and biophysical modellers. CC adaptation modelling draws agricultural modellers into social and political contexts in which their approaches and findings affect who wins and who loses, what is valued and what sacrificed, in the adaptation of agriculture to progressive CC. In modelling CC adaptation in agriculture, there is a need for the agricultural modelling community to focus on the aspects of model content and capacity relating to scope, optimisation, and information, on collaboration across disciplines and institutes, and on the responsibilities of modelling evolving responses to progressive CC.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib73"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref73"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acosta-Michlik</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Espaldon</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Assessing vulnerability of selected farming communities in the Philippines based on a behavioural model of agent's adaptation to global environmental change</article-title><source>Glob.

Data has a value to those who hold it, which may mean that it is not used to the full extent possible: &#x0201c;Intellectual property and 'turf'; secrecy and privacy: often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and/or obtain cash and rights&#x0201d; Limited accessibility may also be a more straightforward issue of communication and knowledge, with modellers who have many demands on their time looking for: &#x0201c;Data capture from readily available sources to reduce time spent getting outputs&#x0201d; To tackle this challenge, the need for shared resources was highlighted: &#x0201c;Inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information&#x0201c;</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="appsec2.2"><title>Data availability</title><p id="p0210">Limitations in available data were commented on with respect to most aspects of adaptation modelling (Table B.1).

Some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability, rather than real differences in conditions &#x0201c;Subjective expert knowledge on 'probability' of events and shocks&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.4"><title>Collaboration</title><p id="p0220">Participants identified issues of a lack of interaction and understanding between modellers in different communities &#x02013; for example, between disease modellers and other agricultural systems modellers as a particular issue: &#x0201c;Disease modellers do not consider other modelling groups as potential users of their models/outputs. There is a gap between the modelling communities - important challenge for modelling adaptation&#x0201d;. And a lack of interaction between empirical researchers and modellers was also raised as a challenge: &#x0201c;No insight or insufficient insight on data availability from other disciplines&#x0201d;. Several participants highlighted the need for work across disciplines, and this was associated with the need to provide models that met the requirements of users: &#x0201c;Linking groups 'interdisciplinarity' to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user&#x0201d;. Collaboration is underpinned by the need to improve how information about models (source codes etc.) is shared between researchers.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.5"><title>Communication</title><p id="p0225">Modelling can produce complex findings that are a challenge to communicate to end users, with certain procedures not intuitively understandable for non-modellers: &#x0201c;Comprehensible sensitivity analysis&#x0201d;. Participants recognised the importance of communication skills in relation to ensuring outputs are easy to take in for different groups: &#x0201c;Policy makers want to receive a simplified summary of key outputs, not to be given complex model details. Other stakeholders also require simplified outputs. How can we make material digestible for stakeholders?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;How to communicate suggested feed changes to farmers&#x0201d;. Communication skills were emphasized as a challenge: &#x0201c;The process of transferring information might limit its accessibility [for stakeholders]. Care is needed in the communication process&#x0201d;. And also the importance of more integrated engagement to enable users and modellers to understand each other better: &#x0201c;Organising dynamic learning and communication processes&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.6"><title>Discrete events modelling</title><p id="p0230">One-off or extreme events are shocks to a system that may be hard to predict: &#x0201c;Risk and timing of extreme events&#x0201d;. And the effects of which may alter both, future states of the system, and the ability of decision makers to implement adaptation options: &#x0201c;The length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices, and this is hard to model (e.g. a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought, but previous droughts, or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available&#x0201d;. Discrete events also include the challenge of modelling &#x02018;threshold&#x02019; changes in behaviour &#x02013; the appearance and implementation of a new disruptive technology or the point at which stakeholders move from adaptation of current systems to transformation to new systems &#x02013; in relation to causes, timing and impacts of such changes: &#x0201c;Disruptive technology: One of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural (for example, a transition to food derived from bio-reactors)&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.7"><title>Dynamic change modelling</title><p id="p0235">Adaptations can be implemented in different ways, which are likely to influence how they affect the system, and this presents a challenge for modelling: &#x0201c;Solutions can be applied in many different ways (gradually, in one step, in a series of steps &#x02013; &#x02018;timeframe of choices&#x02019;) so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity for modellers&#x0201d;. At the same time, biophysical processes themselves may occur over different (short- and long-term) time scales, which can be hard to capture: &#x0201c;Short term (eg annual) versus long term (eg decadal) simulations, e.g. soil carbon, soil organic matter (long term dynamics) not well addressed&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.8"><title>Engagement approach</title><p id="p0240">Participants highlighted the challenge of engaging in meaningful ways with stakeholders: &#x0201c;How to build long term connections between interested farmers and scientists that go way beyond usual project durations&#x0201d;. A range of approaches and tools for improved engagement with stakeholders was shared, for example: &#x0201c;Typical farms as anchor for simulating and presenting my results&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Thinking about a game in which effects and feedbacks can be explored in a kind of 'what happens when' machine&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.9"><title>External limitations modelling</title><p id="p0245">This theme focuses on changes to policy or biophysical constraints beyond the system that affect the implementation of adaptation options and its consequences: &#x0201c;Policy limitations to model adaptation strategies: change feeding increases milk yield. But, milk quota&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Consideration of temporary regional constraints (e.g. regional silage market in case of drought)&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.10"><title>Interactions modelling</title><p id="p0250">This theme encompasses challenges relating to i) a lack of underlying understanding of the interactions between factors and mechanisms in agricultural systems: &#x0201c;Too many interacting factors and interacting mechanisms are still not well enough understood to be modelled (e.g heat stress on animal productivity includes many confounding effects and studies generally do not separate these effects sufficiently&#x0201d; ii) challenges relating to the computational power required in characterising complex interactions involving a number of inter-dependent types of mechanism: &#x0201c;Computability: To integrate inter-dependent: sectors, scales (spatial) ecosystem services, scales (temporal) adaptations, future scenario space, uncertainty etc.&#x0201d;. These issues relate to biophysical interactions: &#x0201c;Grassland models are not able to simulate the diversity of species and inter-specific interactions that characterise grasslands&#x0201d;, to economic and management interactions &#x02013; such as the cost/availability of novel options and the changes in management required when they are implemented: &#x0201c;Cost and availability of new technologies (e.g. breeds, soil management options). Also including the change in management required (e.g. new feed regime for new breeds)&#x0201d; and, to the effects of implementation on the biophysical system: &#x0201c;The application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex, for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change&#x0201d;, and finally to feedback, arising from management changes: &#x0201c;Incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models at all: in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs, and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.11"><title>Management modelling</title><p id="p0255">This theme refers to the challenge of understanding and then modelling the decision to implement change &#x02013; what factors (values, knowledge, age, economics) influence these stakeholder choices, and how can these be incorporated into models: &#x0201c;Adaptation is related to the perception of farmers and their sensitivity to change in a specific aspect of management (e.g. they are likely to be more willing to change some practices than others). The uptake of adaptation measures is therefore dependent on culture and knowledge as well as external risk&#x0201d;. Differentiation was made between reactive and proactive change: &#x0201c;Farmers have to face actual events, not the risk of events. After such events a range of actions will be required for a system to recover; these represent &#x02018;reactive&#x02019; adaptation, which is not the same as pre-emptive adaptation to reduce future impacts&#x0201d;. With a question as to how biophysical models can incorporate adaptation when choices to adapt are made in advance of biophysical triggers to change: &#x0201c;How do biophysical models include the costs of anticipatory strategies?&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.12"><title>Novel scenarios</title><p id="p0260">Under climate change models will be faced with the need to characterise new circumstances and their impacts: &#x0201c;Under climate change, relationships between variables may not remain the same (e.g. under more extreme conditions than tested for) and we need to try to understand these potential changes&#x0201d; One challenge is to represent the impacts of climate change on the biophysical system: &#x0201c;Differential effect of increasing CO2 on mixed swards&#x0201d;. And their downstream impacts on production: &#x0201c;Roughage quality analysis not future proof (mixed sward quality under climate change)&#x0201d;. On top of this, is the need to then understand how the implementation of adaptation options will affect such changed systems: &#x0201c;Model limitations for allocating land to feed types (plus protein feeds?) e.g. forage versus cereal crops (adaptation through changing feeding patterns)&#x0201d;. This may include the introduction of new production options: &#x0201c;Nitrogen cycle: To create a zero sum long term N balance - what happens in a semi-arid soil? What happens under agro forestry? What happens in ley plus arable?&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.13"><title>Resources for modelling</title><p id="p0265">This theme covers three main areas. 1) The way that models develop over time, and how this affects their capabilities (e.g. if some parts are based on older research) and the capacity of their users to understand them: &#x0201c;Some model limitations come from the development of models over time. For example, [MODEL NAME] was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in (what now seems) a limited way. Management experts then moved on to other projects, and [MODEL NAME] became more biophysical&#x0201d;. Especially when the agricultural modelling field may not have the space to nurture many careers: &#x0201c;Agricultural systems modellers: very narrow resource pool, very different funding, too few can form a career at the coal face - many just pass through&#x0201d;. 2) Issues relating to computability, and the need to incorporate more and more complexity while handling the trade-off with usability: &#x0201c;Computability: To integrate inter-dependent: sectors, scales (spatial) ecosystem services, scales (temporal) adaptations, future scenario space, uncertainty etc.&#x0201d;. Finally, modelling resources may not be distributed equally across specific topics, and this unevenness may not reflect the importance of individual topics in relation to adaptation: &#x0201c;With disease, endemic diseases are more important than incursions, but less attractive to funders (e.g. liverfluke)&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.14"><title>Role of modellers</title><p id="p0270">Focuses on the different ways in which modellers engage with real world problems. This includes various roles for model outputs to demonstrate the importance of something, to allowing comparisons of systems (benchmarking) to informing decision making, and in the development of new ideas, and also includes changes in the role of the modellers themselves (not just their tools): &#x0201c;Paradigm shift in the research praxis: from observer to co-researchers/knowledge brokers&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.15"><title>Scale interactions</title><p id="p0275">The theme consists of challenges to modelling how change at one scale affects that at another, including the need to predict the farm-scale impacts of wider changes: &#x0201c;Not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible: How to assess the impacts at farm-scale?&#x0201d;. And the importance of scaling up detailed farm-level modelling to provide regional scale predictions: &#x0201c;Upscaling issues e.g. modelling at farm scale and [&#x02026;] impacts at landscape scale&#x0201d;. Participants highlighted how such effects cross the boundaries between economic and biophysical modelling: &#x0201c;Need to start with farm-level adaptations. Farmers may observe regional water issues and pay for own storage, or find it better to reduce water dependence by using different crops etc.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.16"><title>Scope</title><p id="p0280">This theme focuses on the extent to which models cover different regions and systems &#x0201c;Difficulties in modelling Mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self-reseeding species: the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands (mainly dominated by perennials&#x0201d;. Elements of systems: &#x0201c;Demonstrate how biodiversity impacts productivity, e.g. by showing influence of pest predation on yield, and impact of beneficial fauna on this: Acceptance and better understanding of feedback effects between production, biodiversity and ecosystem services (societal value)&#x0201d;. And the extent to which they are able to span (or take into account) interactions between biophysical management and economic elements of change, which are central to understanding adaptation: &#x0201c;Biophysical models ignore economic life; e.g. if all farms use more imported feed, then feed prices will rise, people will move out of farming, and animal prices will fall. These are important interactions requiring anticipatory actions by farmers to minimise costs&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.17"><title>User focus</title><p id="p0285">These challenges related to the need to ensure models and their outputs were mindful of the needs of stakeholders, who may differ from modellers in relation to the timescale they are considering, or type of questions they want answered: &#x0201c;Policy makers are asking &#x02018;How do we do X?&#x02019; while scientists are answering &#x02018;What happens if?&#x02019; questions &#x02013; this can create communication problems&#x0201d;. The theme includes the challenge of providing tailored models: &#x0201c;Cooling, ventilation: Adaptation designs are very farm-specific, e.g. requirement for a very detailed design and approach&#x0201d;. To the extent of modelling on demand: &#x0201c;Applied research by demand (i.e. farmer associations demanding to play with their real data)&#x0201d;. Modellers need to consider who their users are and what they need, and working with them can be part of achieving this: &#x0201c;Define end users, target groups and work with them throughout&#x0201d;. Finally, some participants referred to the need to ensure that outputs were interpreted correctly: &#x0201c;Distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive (normative) information and results&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="appsec2.18"><title>Uncertainty modelling</title><p id="p0290">The need for models to be able to deal with uncertainty from biophysical and economic systems, and from models themselves was commented upon by several participants, e.g. &#x0201c;Integration of deviation coming from the biological world in the correctness of the model&#x0201d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="appsec3"><label>Appendix C</label><title>Comparison of workshop findings with a review of crop modelling in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;tter et al., 2018</xref>)</title><p id="p0295">Specific challenges were extracted from the text of the review article and coded, contrasting and comparing these challenges with workshop data and themes, to develop or add themes where required.

(2018)</xref> review, gathering it into intuitive groupings that enabled easier comparison with the challenges identified in the current study. The themes were extracted from the paper using a thematic coding approach (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>). Themes were then compared with challenges identified by modellers in the workshops, to highlight any CC adaptation-specific issues that modellers also need to tackle (gaps in coverage of identified adaptation modelling challenges). How the CCRA for adaptation policy themes, and those identified by modellers, overlapped and complemented each other, is described in section D2 and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table D1</xref> (below) and explained and visualised in main text (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, some of the themes below are grouped according to their type, indicated in brackets next to their title (e.g. incorporating biophysical knowledge into CCRA relates to the availability and quality of data).</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.2"><title>Biophysical knowledge (data availability)</title><p id="p0305">Biophysical systems will respond to climate change in complex ways that interact across systems and over different time scales, including feedback effects on climate change itself; these interactions are not fully understood, including for example potential for critical transitions. Recent studies provide improved assessments of the extent to which specific events can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and predictions about the magnitude and frequency of extreme events.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.3"><title>Cognitive bias</title><p id="p0310">Human choices are often made using mental short-cuts which allow decisions to be made despite limits to available information of the ability to gather and process it. These cognitive factors can bias the choices according to pre-existing preferences, and can lead to inconsistency across scales and contexts of decision making. They may be the result of cultural or inherited traits.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.4"><title>Communication</title><p id="p0315">The challenge of communicating uncertainties, assumptions and limitations, given that the choice of adaptive response is often controversial and liable to scrutiny is important to address. This includes the need to avoid over-technical approaches that might not fit well with some examples of risk, to explain constraints in order to avoid the development of unrealistic expectations around outcomes, to ensure the relevance of outcomes to decision makers (e.g. focussing on urgency, relating risks to current policy outcomes). The presentation of CCRAs can affect their effectiveness in stimulating change; examples from text were the assessment of risks associated with current policy, and how current objectives might be threatened by climate change, and the use of risk registers that use the dimensions of likelihood and impact to bring together, rank, highlight and communicate a range of risks. Transparency and close engagement with users of CCRA outputs are highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.5"><title>Data on adaptation (availability and quality)</title><p id="p0320">The need to better incorporate into CCRA information on the viability of adaptation options, and on the way their effectiveness varies with different scenarios of future change (sensitivity in the context of uncertainty). Lack of data is an important limitation to CCRA, for example relating to monitoring or evaluation of adaptation options, to biophysical systems, their responses and the impacts of human actions on them, and on adaptive capacity. There is a need for improved data quality to move on from piecemeal and/or qualitative/subjective assessments (e.g. expert judgements or stakeholder exercises) to systemized data collection, appraisal and presentation. Monitoring and evaluation data are in many cases limited in terms of survey size and sample type (e.g. only early adopters). Consistency is needed in framing risks and uncertainties and the criteria on which adaptations are evaluated needs to be considered (see also under &#x02018;ethics&#x02019;). Approaches have been developed and used to apply global data to more localised CCRA, to overcome some challenges relating to a lack of data.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.6"><title>Developing new CCRA methods</title><p id="p0325">Risk registers can be useful but may become over-technical, leading to frames being fitted to risks that they are not suited to. In Italy the climate risk index improved model ensemble data and applied a more robust analysis to rank administrative areas in relation to different climate change impacts, in order to support the allocation of funds for adaptation. In CCRA methodological advances such as the business-function framework for business and industry risks are mentioned.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.7"><title>Diversity and number of factors</title><p id="p0330">Diversity is present in i) the context of adaptation, including the perspectives of those involved, what they value or feel concerned about (different types of change and impact, different timescales of change), ii) the diversity of evidence types on which CCRAs must be based, iii) the different underlying assumptions, uses of scenarios and scope of CCRAs, iv) the diversity of risks and adaptive options which means that fitting risks into strict technical parameters for CCRA may not be appropriate. Large numbers of options are also likely to be available for adaptive change.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.8"><title>Ethics</title><p id="p0335">Why intervention should take place and in what form, how CCRAs are presented (including scope, uncertainty, limitations, framing). Recognition of risk as subjective and perceived differently by different groups is mentioned, and aspects such as how adaptations are evaluated (e.g. effectiveness and fairness) are relevant.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.9"><title>Expectations</title><p id="p0340">Decision makers are expecting more from CCRAs, including for example information on the adaptive impacts of current policies and assessments of how to make adaptations more effective. Some examples of CCRAs used in practical policy processes include the climate risk index for Italy which used detailed ensemble modelling and analysis to rank administrative areas according to the risks they faced in relation to specific climate change impacts. Outcomes informed the distribution of financial resources for adaptation. Those using CCRAs need to recognise that complete avoidance of risk is not likely to be practical. Engaging throughout the process of CCRA can help build understanding and reduce differences in expectation between those producing and using the CCRA.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.10"><title>Experience of decision makers</title><p id="p0345">A challenge for climate change adaptation CCRA is that decision makers often have limited experience of dealing with problems with large numbers of alternative options and high uncertainty, while past experience of change often used to quantify risk in CCRAs is not adequate under climate change conditions.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.11"><title>Interdependence</title><p id="p0350">Challenge to understanding i) how risks cascade through interdependent systems (biophysical and human) and ii) how adaptive actions on the ground, policy and risk levels interact. In relation to i) work is needed to better understand linkages and critical transitions within systems (including biophysical-human system interactions). Such interactions and the incorporation of multiple time scales are beyond conventional RA methods but need to be understood to address systemic risks. Using expert stakeholder knowledge can provide a route to understanding how risks are transmitted across sectors and scales. Risk transmission framing is mentioned as a specific methodological advance in relation to assessing cascading risks.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.12"><title>Interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approaches (collaboration)</title><p id="p0355">Challenge of dealing with the wide and interacting impacts of climate change and adaptive responses, including the key integration of biophysical and socio-economic aspects of exposure and vulnerability, and the linking of disaster risk management and CC adaptation expertise. Challenges for research and decision makers at policy level can be addressed by considering the experiences of CCRA in specific sectors, and approaches used to address other complex issues can also be learned from. CCRA approaches for infrastructure and business risks are mentioned as methodological advances relating to specific sectors. Stakeholders can provide expert knowledge to complement scientific understanding. Links across disciplines need to be integrated with links to the needs of adaptation policymakers at a strategic level.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.13"><title>Interests</title><p id="p0360">Individuals and groups vary in how they respond to risk and the types of risk and types of things affected are likely to be qualitatively different, so that attempts at &#x02018;objective&#x02019; comparisons can lead to choices that are suboptimal in terms of people's needs (e.g. irreversible changes, value related to attachment to places and systems with cultural significance). The interests of some groups may trade-off with those of others, and may be sub-optimal when considered more broadly (e.g. policy drive to incentivise food production over environmental protection). Priorities may also link to deeper underlying values that may not be explicit. These issues create a challenge at points where objective CCRAs and subjective perspectives interact. Taken together, the issue of interests raises the important issue of who should be involved in determining the scope and nature of CCRA and the extent and type of response, given that those making choices may not wish to take precautions.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.14"><title>Scenarios</title><p id="p0365">The interactions of climate change with global change in systems resulting from a variety of stressors is a big challenge for scenarios that will need to incorporate how different drivers of change co-evolve, for example by pooling data to discover confounding factors. Scenarios can be used to represent diverse pathways exceeding those accessible through conventional prediction, facilitating understanding of the consequences of change. Presenting a range of scenarios (including extremes) is also a strategy to deal with uncertainty in predictions (see &#x02018;Uncertainty&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.15"><title>Scope</title><p id="p0370">The scope of an CCRA can affect how it is used and how risks are perceived, as well as affecting the accuracy with which incorporated risks are assessed. More recent CCRAs have incorporated socio-economic drivers of vulnerability and CCRAs are being widened to incorporate climate change opportunities to improve balance in decision making. There has been recognition of issues relating to impacts and adaptive responses that cross political borders (relates also to interdependence) and how these can affect risk and adaptive responses. Inclusion of the impact of current adaptation actions on future risk, from policy aspirations to action and adaptive capacity is important, including how different policy drivers might interact with adaptation needs to positively (or negatively) effect risk. Finally, a need to characterise risks and issues related to different coping potentials was identified. Scope interacts with expectations of what CCRAs should provide for policy makers, as well as what they incorporate into their conclusions, with an emphasis on the need to engage with policy and implementation in addition to publishing reports. The review also highlights a modelling challenge also raised by modellers &#x02013; that the variety and diversity of adaptations is a challenge for integrated assessment models that do not incorporate all the required parameters or interactions.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.16"><title>Socio-economic drivers (data availability)</title><p id="p0375">Incorporation of social and economic factors and their interaction with climate change and the nature of adaptive responses into CCRA, drawing on agent based modelling or qualitative understanding of human behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.17"><title>Time lags in adaptation</title><p id="p0380">Implementation of change might not be instant, and may take some time for practical reasons or due to the existence of other barriers (institutions, social reasons) &#x02013; these issues need to be incorporated in assessments of the extent to which an adaptation can offset climate related impacts.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.18"><title>Uncertainty</title><p id="p0385">Uncertainty can limit action if adaptation is undertaken only in the light of predictions. However, predictability is suggested by some authors to be more important when there are few alternative options for action and relative certainty in outcomes &#x02013; this is not the case with climate change. Uncertainty may relate to consequences or likelihood of climate change impacts or in relation to the effects of adaptive actions. In relation to climate change, much uncertainty is probably irreducible. Therefore, &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; is not a positive strategy. Some authors have suggested that uncertainty can be used as knowledge in itself, affecting how the viability of different options for change is viewed. Questions are raised about whether reducing uncertainty increases the effectiveness of decision making, although the importance of providing boundaries to potential outcomes are emphasized by some. Having a range of scenarios &#x02013; including extremes &#x02013; may assist decision making under uncertainty and being explicit about the goals of adaptation is also important. Involving stakeholders in participatory approaches to change based on precautionary principles can be a more effective path for decision making with unavoidable uncertainty than using metrices and making decision trees. Other approaches include incorporating the temporal aspects of change (e.g. dynamic adaptation pathways with trigger points, robust decision making approaches, and risk layering according to risk and return periods) and stress testing to assess critical levels for ecosystem functioning in natural systems.</p></sec><sec id="appsec4.19"><title>D2.

Collaboration (main paper <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, E) is covered in the main text.</p><sec id="appsec5.1"><title>1. Climate change adaptation modelling and stakeholders</title><sec id="appsec5.1.1"><title>Responsibilities of modelling under progressive change</title><p id="p0400">Recent integrated modelling initiatives have demonstrated the use of agricultural modelling within a process in which model outcomes provide the basis for exploring the broader impacts of change, beyond those normally incorporated in agricultural modelling. In Sardinia models revealed likely reductions in summer sheep's milk production under CC; considering this, researchers and stakeholders explored potential consequences for the supply chain and other economic sectors (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dono et al., 2016</xref>). Lower milk production would reduce availability of cheese for tourists, while reduction in milk quality could cause problems for transformation into products with a quality label. One issue exemplified by this study, is that of limitations and uncertainty in modelling. Available statistical heat stress models were not able to incorporate adaptive responses, demonstrating the importance of clearly communicating the meaning and limitations of results to avoid misuse. Such limitations include uncertainty about CC impacts and adaptive responses. The use of impact (<xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Pirttioja et al., 2015</xref>) and adaptation response surfaces (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2018</xref>) together with robustness indexes of adaptation recommendations (<xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 2018</xref>) have been used in biophysical models to address this challenge. Uncertainty makes developing sound protocols for adaptation modelling vital in preventing model misuse and reducing the potential for incorrect or misinterpreted outputs to drive mal-adaptive change (<xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0405">A second issue raised within the Sardinian study, was that dairy cow systems with access to irrigation were predicted to be less affected by CC than more traditional sheep systems. Choices made by policymakers presented with such evidence, would depend on how the modelling message was framed, and what was valued in that framing (e.g. economic benefit, ecological footprint, tradition and culture, tourism or agriculture, the interests of a particular sector). Modelled impacts might therefore drive adaptive responses in very different directions, changing who is affected by climate change, and how (<xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Reckien et al., 2017</xref>). In undertaking and presenting findings modellers may unwittingly be used to support the case of specific stakeholder groups (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). In highlighting how models can shape stakeholder views and agendas, the data from this study illustrate how modellers might alter what stakeholders consider in their choices. This issue might be addressed by considering how to make researchers more accountable for their influence on decision-making, or by ensuring that, by representing the agendas of the affected as well as the affecting, and by expressing the limitations to their work, modellers can enable stakeholders and policymakers to retain responsibility for their actions.</p><p id="p0410">The progressive nature of CC and (as a result) CC adaptation, and how it shapes the systems on which humanity relies, brings to the fore the tension between research following pragmatic, consensus-seeking approaches to engagement, and critical approaches that see exploring and making different societal groups aware of conflicts and power relations as prerequisites for just solutions (<xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Johansson and Lindhult, 2008</xref>). While social learning approaches facilitating co-learning between researchers and stakeholders may underpin more effective, sustainable, bottom-up change in agriculture (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>) questions still remain about how the needs and values of those outside the process are recognised. The ability of modelling to help stakeholders understand how their actions can affect other systems and actors (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Vieira Pak and Castillo Brieva, 2010</xref>) suggests a role in helping stakeholders and policymakers at all levels to conceptualise the types of CC futures their adaptive choices are likely to create. How well modellers can fulfil the role of facilitating learning and exploration by stakeholders, is linked to the extent to which they are willing and can work together across disciplines to recognise and present a range of strategies and consequences.</p></sec><sec id="appsec5.1.2"><title>Information on adaptive responses to progressive change</title><p id="p0415">For models such as regional Integrated Land use Models (ILMs) or biophysical models well-specified adaptation strategies may be included as inputs &#x02013; these are frequently defined by experts. External information can be added about the adaptation (e.g. for ILMs, the regional availability of relevant technology, and the required infrastructure and conditions, such as water availability and institutional settings). Although technical coefficient generators can be used to identify a large range of alternative adaptations; e.g. <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Janssen et al. (2010)</xref>, information may also be needed on adoption (e.g. in positive mathematical programming models) posing a particular challenge for adaptation measures which are not yet available. At regional level, socio-economic scenarios are being created to consistently define framework conditions for adaptation, improving transparency and comparability in the assumptions underlying model predictions. These include the Regional Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) developed within AgMIP (<xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">Valdivia et al., 2013</xref>). RAPs are characterised with input from stakeholders and experts to ensure their coherence and relevance. However, scenarios may still face issues including limitations in the scenario-building approach, the choice of stakeholders and experts from whom to gather data, and the potential for uncritical inclusion of implicit sociological assumptions (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jansen, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0420">At farm-scale, eliciting farmers&#x02019; objectives is not straightforward; what they say and what they do may not be the same (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Mandryk et al., 2014</xref>). Rather than using expert judgement to validate the performance of decision making sub-models, models such as MELODIE (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2012</xref>) have used on-farm observations of real behaviour (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et al., 2005</xref>) removing doubt about the accuracy of reported actions. However, validation based on observed behaviour may not reflect future choices under progressive CC. In addition, lack of knowledge about the future availability and quality of alternative inputs (e.g. concentrate feeds) may limit the ability of modelling at farm-scale to apply relevant scenarios. Studies using the bio-economic farm-scale model FSSIM (<xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Kanellopoulos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>) came to different conclusions due to differences in the projected possibility of renting land, which influenced crop rotations, constraining choices.</p><p id="p0425">A range of approaches exist for increasing the accuracy of predicted behaviour in farm-scale bio-economic modelling (<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al., 2018</xref>). Some maintain assumptions of rational, profit maximising behaviour, but include impacts of uncertainty and changing experience in decision making processes, such as the use of Discrete stochastic programming (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dono et al., 2016</xref>), or make alternative assumptions about farmers&#x02019; risk behaviour (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Finger and Calanca, 2011</xref>).

Model findings may also be presented in the context of a critical assessment of wider implications of implementation including adaptation effects on social or environmental objectives such farm income, CC mitigation, or water quality; e.g. <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al.

This feeds into the idea of cycling between biophysical and socio-economic aspects in participatory processes of research, and the creation of adaptive loops to maintain flexibility in the face of changing conditions (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Howden et al., 2007</xref>). A recent review of scenario planning (<xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Star et al., 2016</xref>), provided a matrix of approaches that can be aligned with different roles for modelling, which may: support stakeholders in determining adaptation strategies that help them meet the (normative) objectives they desire, provide a range of (exploratory) outcomes for them to consider, present them with a recommended (normative) outcome, or finally, provide a range of strategies that they would like models to explore. Engagement with experts in scenario planning can therefore address issues relating to gathering information on future conditions, with different approaches supporting modellers in tackling the challenge of Responsibilities of modelling in the context of progressive change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, A).</p></sec></sec><sec id="appsec5.2"><title>2. Bio-economic modelling</title><sec id="appsec5.2.1"><title>Scope of adaptations modelled</title><p id="p0435">To characterise how adaptation affects biophysical processes, farm-scale bio-economic models rely on either, inputs from biophysical models (from one-off data input to integrated frameworks) or the creation of simpler endogenous representations of biophysical systems. The scope of adaptation strategies they characterise is therefore constrained by the scope of these linked models, including in relation to the objectives of adaptation strategies, with most crop models focussing on yield rather than other types of outcome (<xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Mandryk et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Linking to crop models using modular approaches is a common solution to increase scope, e.g. the link between EPIC and FAMOS[space] (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000f6;nhart et al., 2016</xref>), or WOFOST and the Agro Climate Calendar and FarmDESIGN (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mandryk et al., 2017</xref>), where crop management choices are modelled at field level.</p><p id="p0440">Fewer models link to biophysical animal models, with livestock production often represented via feed budgeting and/or herd dynamics modules (e.g. FAMOS[space], ScotFarm, MODAM) with annual or monthly time steps. Farm-scale bio-economic models might also include integrated cropping or soil processes, exemplified by the incorporation of soil carbon stocks in FarmDesign (<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Groot et al., 2012</xref>). Adaptation modelling is then possible to the extent that CC and adaptation impacts can be translated to the relevant co-efficients in these modules (e.g. change in milk yield or liveweight gain). Solutions for fully integrated livestock and crop production sub-modules also exist; for example, the DairyNZ model takes weather data directly, with pasture and cow metabolism modules operating with a daily time step, and an annual time-step economic module (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Kalaugher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0445">At regional level, ILMs have a wide spatial scope from landscape (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Briner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al., 2015a</xref>,<xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>) and sub-regional (<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000f6;nhart et al., 2014</xref>) to continental levels (<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Holman et al., 2017</xref>) and integrate field, animal, and farm-scale biophysical and economic models (or components of them) to represent bio-physical and human systems and their interactions. Regional ILMs based on a normative concept of adaptive decision making, such as some linear programming models assuming profit maximization (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Annetts and Audsley, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Kirchner et al., 2016</xref>) have the scope to model novel land use outcomes (e.g. new crop species or the adoption of new technology) although this requires prior specification of the measure by the user &#x02013; this is particularly challenging in regional ILM due to their large spatial and farming system coverage. Regional ILM based on positive concepts of adaptation decision making, such as positive mathematical programming (PMP) models (<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Sch&#x000f6;nhart et al., 2014</xref>) or econometric models (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Fezzi and Bateman, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Moore and Lobell, 2014</xref>) may face challenges in representing adaptation beyond previously observed ranges. An option to overcome this limitation is the incorporation of observed management practices from other regions, where climatic conditions are similar to those expected in the focus region under CC. In terms of representing future technologies, <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Dietrich et al. (2014)</xref> endogenously modelled investment-dependent technological change in the global ILM MAgPIE. For ILMs, further research is required to understand adaptation outcomes when relationships between farms, supply chains, and marketing of agricultural products are taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="appsec5.2.2"><title>Optimisation under progressive change and with thresholds</title><p id="p0450">Dynamic bio-economic farm-scale models such as ScotFarm can represent inter-temporal dependencies (e.g. agronomic effects of adaptation via changing rotations or herd management or the financial aspects of longer term investment and policy and/or market changes). Agronomic thresholds can be incorporated into farm-scale bio-economic models either via the functions of specific modules (e.g. linked crop models) or external data input. However, incremental adaptation can only be assessed if relevant processes are integrated or if data are provided from external models (<xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Janssen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Schaap et al., 2013</xref>). Economic thresholds (e.g. farms going out of production due to losses) can be represented, although financial modules often work at the gross or net margin level, not considering reserves and credit availability. To the extent that alternative practices can be characterised, step changes in management and in contextual scenarios can be compared, including the impacts of long-term financial investment (which can be annualised over the investment's lifetime to make them comparable).</p><p id="p0455">While some adaptation requires binary decisions (e.g. whether to establish cover crops on a plot), other decisions can be continuous (e.g. the choice of fertilisation levels or irrigation rates). ILMs frequently link single models sequentially and are static with respect to land use decisions, rarely representing feedbacks of adaptation choices on CC altered biophysical systems. Consequently, they are limited in relation to evaluating how the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies evolve over time. Modelling of dynamic adaptation processes such as applied in bio-economic farm models is complicated by the larger spatial and farming system coverage of ILMs. Even for market feedbacks, many applications use exogenous price assumptions on agricultural inputs and outputs independent from adaptation choices. In regional ILMs, adaptation thresholds are mainly determined by economic cost-benefit considerations &#x02013; a considerable simplification from real-world decision making. One-off investment decisions can be modelled by comparing average costs and benefits (e.g. represented in annuities) but this requires assumptions about the dynamic effects of adaptation strategies such as transition periods. Options to overcome challenges relating to optimisation under progressive change include risk sensitive dynamic modelling of annual land use decisions (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Lehtonen, 2012</xref>). Abstracting from the farm level in regional ILM eases the representation of transformative shifts between farming systems, such as land cover conversion, changes in livestock, or between organic and conventional farming systems. However, static models are prone to overestimating the likelihood of dynamic transformation processes (e.g. forest succession); including risk behaviour, as in many bio-economic farm models (<xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), can make such the representation of adaptation choices more realistic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="appsec5.3"><title>3. Biophysical modelling</title><sec id="appsec5.3.1"><title>Scope of adaptations modelled</title><p id="p0460">The focus of many recent crop model inter-comparisons has been on wheat e.g. <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Asseng et al.

The effects of CC on pest and disease ecology and spread, and the consequences for different plant species and communities also need to be better incorporated into models as a pre-requisite to simulating the impacts of adaptation strategies focussed on plant health (<xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Newbery et al., 2016</xref>). Challenges of model scope and adaptation impact are being tackled in relation to several specific adaptations, including modelling crop rotations (<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Kollas et al., 2015</xref>) and CC effects on harvest quality (<xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Nuttall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler and Reynolds, 2013</xref>). The characterisation of intercropping systems and crop mixtures is also challenging with most models currently representing such systems as a single crop, with characteristics based on those of the combined crop. An advance is the characterisation of two species independently, accounting for soil nutrient and light sharing between them, e.g. STICS, <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Corre-Hellou et al. (2009)</xref>. Multi-species grasslands are also likely to be more resilient to CC (<xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together the need for multi-species modelling for arable and grassland systems creates potential for collaboration with ecological modellers more used to dealing with multi-species swards (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016c</xref>, <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Van Oijen et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work in this area includes the development of dynamic modelling of both species composition and changes in biomass in productive grasslands (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Moulin et al., 2018</xref>). Grassland models have flexibility through their mechanistic incorporation of a range of biophysical processes, such as plant-grazing animal interactions (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Graux et al., 2011</xref>). The inclusion of these and other detailed sward processes, along with outputs relating to production, nutrient flows and GHG emissions (<xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Cobena et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrate the scope of such models to characterise adaptive changes via the alteration of input variables by the user.</p><p id="p0465">As in the case of bio-economic models (section 3.4.2) the scope of farm-scale biophysical models to characterise novel adaptations, is determined by the capabilities of the crop and grass models to which they are linked. Thus, in MELODIE (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2012</xref>) a dynamic model designed to simulate nutrient flows across a mixed farming system, operational (short term, within a season) adaptations associated with crop and grassland management and short term changes in feed rations are incorporated via the STICS crop model. Tactical (annual) adaptations linked with the planning of crop rotations, feed rations, and fertilisation strategy are also simulated using specific sub-models (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Chardon, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2008</xref>). However, farm scale models must also consider adaptations associated with farm infrastructure and resources (e.g. housing, imported feed) and interactions between these systemic components that might produce emergent effects (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2012</xref>). Within MELODIE, manpower, machinery and some aspects of animal housing (e.g. control of ventilation, alleviation of heat stress or addition of water to slurry tank) are not included, excluding consideration of related adaptation strategies. Assessing the value of some tactical adaptations like the use of cover crops, changing crop species/varieties, or the implementation of different tillage practices is possible, but only by comparing several (with vs without adaptation) scenarios, and not by simulating such changes in response to external factors. Similarly, some adaptations can be simulated by altering input variables (e.g. change in the calving pattern, use of alternative forages, changes of breeds or changes in manure processing). Inclusion of farm-scale biophysical models in modelling platforms, e.g. MELODIE within the INRA modelling platform (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Bergez et al., 2013</xref>) allow them to benefit from improvements in sub-models.
