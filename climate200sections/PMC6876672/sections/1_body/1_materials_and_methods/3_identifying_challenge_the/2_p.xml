<p id="p0055">Two workshops were held to understand and explore modellers' views on the challenges to modelling CC adaptation, bringing together researchers from across the Modelling European Agriculture with Climate Change for Food Security (MACSUR) knowledge hub (

The workshops engaged 22 modellers from 21 institutes across 11 European countries, with participants representing a purposive sample of agricultural modellers with a specific interest in modelling CC adaptation (

 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>) from across crop, grassland, livestock farm-scale and economic modelling disciplines. Workshops gathered participantsâ€™ views through two structured discussions in which attendees were asked to map adaptation strategies for agriculture and related modelling challenges. Participants were asked what the challenges to modelling climate change adaptation were. They recorded their ideas on sticky notes (one challenge per note) to reduce bias towards the views of vocal participants which can arise in group discussions (
