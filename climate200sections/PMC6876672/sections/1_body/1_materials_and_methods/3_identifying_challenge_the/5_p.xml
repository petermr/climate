<p id="p0070">An important aspect of grounded theory methodology is to ensure data saturation (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2017</xref>) where no new themes or issues arise from the data. To check this, specific modelling challenges were identified in the text of a global review focussed on crop modelling of the impacts of and adaptation to CC (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¶tter et al., 2018</xref>). These challenges were coded to ascertain whether any new themes were present, or whether workshop themes were sufficient to accommodate the challenges described (indicating saturation). The article also defined challenges specific to modelling tropical plant production systems, providing a test of whether themes arising from the contributions of European modellers involved in the present study have relevance beyond the region.
