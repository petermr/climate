<p id="p0050">The study proceeded in three stages: i) modelling challenges were identified by modellers within workshops and analysed to identify challenge themes and categories, ii) findings were triangulated by comparing the identified themes with modelling challenges described in existing reviews. This process was used to validate the workshop data and to identify themes likely to include elements specific to modelling CC adaptation, iii) the subset of challenges considered to have CC adaptation specific aspects was considered in the light of a review of the wider literature on CC adaptation, to highlight those novel elements.</p>
