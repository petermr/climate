<p id="p0150">The issue of path dependency is also relevant to the ‘Use of models’ challenge category. In the literature on CC adaptation, even the need for intervention to ensure agricultural adaptation to CC is contested, with some suggesting that market forces will automatically adjust systems to change, while others argue that progressive CC will require well-planned responses beyond the autonomous, incremental change already undertaken by agricultural stakeholders (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). Relying on autonomous responses or intervening to completely manage CC adaptation, are two extremes in a continuum of approaches. Which adaptive pathway (different types of planned response or, reliance on autonomous change) appears most favourable depends on chosen system boundaries (e.g. biophysical processes, economic processes, social processes) and the nature of CC change (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>) but, also on desired outcomes and on whose desires are considered. Although profit or production maximising objectives may be assumed in ‘hard systems’ (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">van Paassen et al., 2007</xref>) research approaches, this assumption has been described as representing an ‘implicit sociology’ (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jansen, 2009</xref>) of unexplored motives and opinions. If particular motives and objectives for change have already been assumed in a model, this represents a move towards more instrumental engagement with stakeholders (to improve research outcomes or increase the implementation of recommendations) and away from normative engagement (involvement of stakeholders and incorporation of their views and needs as a right) (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al., 2009</xref>). Using 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Freeman's (1984)</xref> classification of affected and affecting stakeholders, this focus shifts attention from those who may be affected by change, towards those that can affect change. In this context, and given that the quantification of information (e.g., in models) is understood to fundamentally alter how things are perceived and valued (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Espeland and Stevens, 2008</xref>) it is important that the aims modellers focus on, what models include, who they are for, and how they are communicated, are critically reflected on by modellers in general. Within the current study, the more normative aspects of the ‘Use of models’ challenge category reflected awareness among modellers of the potential for models to affect the direction of choices (including adaptive responses) and of how, in some cases, modellers are facing the challenge of assuming new roles, e.g. recognising a “
 <italic>Paradigm shift in the research praxis: from observer to co-researchers/knowledge brokers</italic>”. Much previous work considers these issues, with recent reviews focussing on best practice in stakeholder involvement, model development, use, and evaluation (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jakeman et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Voinov et al., 2016</xref>) including the development of specific engagement processes drawing on understanding of ‘soft systems’ approaches (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2015</xref>). However, with pathway dependency in the context of progressive CC, the potential impacts of model findings beyond the implementation of a given modelled choice, add an extra dimension to issues of model use. This additional element can be seen as a CC adaptation-specific challenge to model use.
