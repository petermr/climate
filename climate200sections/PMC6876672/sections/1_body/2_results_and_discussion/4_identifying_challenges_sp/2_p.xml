Climate change differs from most other issues in that it overlays pre-existing socio-economic (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Iglesias and Garrote, 2015</xref>) and environmental challenges, and represents a progressive and sustained change over time. As CC affects the biophysical systems on which we rely in multiple ways, it produces cascades of interacting impacts and feedbacks within and between sectors, making studies of CC issues particularly complex (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Terzi et al., 2019</xref>). So, while other types of change affecting farming may also be progressive (e.g. increasing demand for meat and dairy products, advances in technology) CC is unique as a sustained, progressive change in the biophysical systems that farmers rely on, rather than just in the socio-economic context in which farming takes place. Path dependency in relation to processes of economic and political change over time, including in agricultural systems (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kay, 2003</xref>) (see 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Martin and Sunley (2006)</xref> for a critical review) means that our iterative responses to progressive CC may lead us down particular pathways, each with different implications for different societal groups, regions and biophysical systems. For example, investment to install and improve irrigation systems may make increasing crop water supply more cost effective for a farmer than changing towards more water efficient systems as CC advances, with implications for other water users and the environment. In Sardinia, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dono et al. (2016)</xref> found that intensive dairy farming reliant on irrigation systems is likely to be less vulnerable to CC than traditional, low input sheep production reliant on natural water supplies. Therefore, pathways of adaptive response to progressive CC need to be explored in order to facilitate informed and reflective decision making that take such issues into account. In this light, the
