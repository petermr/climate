<p id="p0155">As discussed above, CC adaptation modellers (including biophysical modellers as well as bio-economic modellers) need to consider how social conflicts, power relations and sectoral interests may influence their work and its use (

Such considerations enable modellers to recognise the implications of their focus (on which stakeholders, which objectives, which adaptations and which impacts) and to identify ways to ensure that the wider context of non-modelled strategies and impacts is conveyed to stakeholders. This may be carried out by the modellers themselves where they have the required expertise and sufficient resources but, may also be achieved through
