<p id="p0175">The need to characterise a wider range of sometimes transformative adaptations in agricultural models, makes it essential to include, smaller and geographically marginal research groups in inter-disciplinary networks, to capture the diversity of expertise in the research community. These groups are vital to fully leveraging existing expertise, along with ‘core’ research groups that may find it easier to engage (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>), linking local research expertise across regions offers the opportunity to explore novel solutions, cross-pollinating ideas between scientific communities within and between disciplines. The need for integrated modelling approaches to investigate CC impacts and adaptation has been widely recognised (
