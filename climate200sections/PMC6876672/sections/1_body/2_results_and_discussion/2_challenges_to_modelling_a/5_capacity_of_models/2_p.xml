<p id="p0100">In contrast to comments about what models characterise and how (Content), a distinct set of contributions were related to information and support for modelling. Many participants highlighted historical and resource-related reasons for model limitations; “
 <italic>Some model limitations come from the development of models over time. E.g., [MODEL NAME] was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in (what now seems) a limited way. Management experts then moved on to other projects, and [MODEL NAME] became more biophysical</italic>”. Model evolution was seen to create problems in the capacity of successive generations of researchers to use models effectively “
 <italic>Most models contain vast amounts of implicit knowledge […] Continuity of human capital is too short - this rapidly degrades the future utility of models despite huge latent potential</italic>”. Some participants referred to how model capacity can be shaped by the interests of funders, which may not align with priorities identified by researchers “
 <italic>With disease, endemic diseases are more important than incursions, but less attractive to funders (e.g. liver fluke)</italic>”. Collaboration was seen as a way to tackle issues of capacity by drawing on wider expertise: “
 <italic>Linking groups 'interdisciplinarily' to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user</italic>”
