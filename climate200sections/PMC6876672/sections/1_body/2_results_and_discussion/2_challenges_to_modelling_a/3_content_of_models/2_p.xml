<p id="p0085">Many comments made by participants related to the fundamental question of how (and how well) models characterise systems. For some, the effects of external processes on systems was important “
 <italic>Not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible: How to assess the impacts at farm-scale?</italic>” including top-down political influences “
 <italic>Changes in policies can make previous changes in farm strategic planning (investments) useless</italic>”. Other comments highlighted challenges of modelling different types of change over time “
 <italic>Solutions can be applied in many different ways (gradually, in one step, in a series of steps – ‘timeframe of choices’) so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity</italic>” and in particular, sudden change in biophysical systems “
 <italic>The length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices, and this is hard to model (e.g. a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought, but previous droughts, or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available)</italic>” and changes in the adaptive choices available “
 <italic>Disruptive technology: One of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural</italic>”. Issues were also raised relating to when choices are made “
 <italic>When it becomes preferable to change the system (production) rather than to adapt</italic>”. Underlying these challenges, were those relating to modelling interactions within systems in general, e.g. “
 <italic>The application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex, for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change</italic>”, with adaptation adding further complexity “
 <italic>Incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs, and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure</italic>”.
