 <italic>Nitrogen cycle: To create a zero-sum long term N balance - what happens in a semi-arid soil? What happens under agro forestry? What happens in ley plus arable?</italic>”. The category is bound together by a sense from the data of a research community that is itself being asked to adapt. This mirrors the progressive nature of CC, how this is changing modelling priorities, and how it disrupts a research community of previously discrete, specialised modelling groups, forcing them to broaden their focus and the application of their models (see also Section
