<p id="p0120">Comparison of the challenge themes derived from workshop data with the CCRA review (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al., 2018</xref>) identified workshop challenges also recognised as issues for the adaptation (but not agriculture) specific field of CCRA for adaptation policy. The aim was to highlight challenges with potentially adaptation-specific aspects for further consideration (for full details of themes from the CCRA review and of the comparison, see 
 <xref rid="appsec4" ref-type="sec">Appendix D</xref>). In relation to the category of Capacity in the current study, several themes were found in both modelling and CCRA studies, specifically: 
 <italic>Collaboration</italic>, 
 <italic>Data availability</italic>, 
 <italic>Data quality</italic>, 
 <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> and 
 <italic>Uncertainty</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Challenges identified by modellers relating to resource availability (
 <italic>Resources for modelling</italic>), and 
 <italic>Data accessibility</italic> (i.e. due to communication and ownership of data rather than due to whether they exist) were not raised in relation to CCRA for adaptation policy. This difference may reflect the very specific data requirements of models, and the fact that agricultural modelling must come together across specific disciplines to incorporate CC adaptation, while CCRA is already a united community explicitly focused on this aim and working in direct support of policy. In general, these two challenge themes are clearly not a specific issue for modelling CC adaptation in agriculture, but broader challenges to model development and application.
