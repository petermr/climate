<p id="p0130">The biggest differences between the current study and the CCRA review were found in the category of Use of models. Participants in the current study expressed awareness of practical challenges relating to how to improve model relevance (

 <italic>Engagement approaches</italic> that modellers need to use, the 
 <italic>Role of modelling</italic> (when and how to engage) and the challenge of effective 
 <italic>Communication</italic> with stakeholders. However, they did not consider how such issues might interact with differing stakeholder limitations and agendas – which was highlighted in the CCRA review within several different themes (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, A – black boxes). These differences in relation to Use, may reflect the different characteristics of modelling versus risk assessment: In a CCRA, data form the core content, with the scope of the assessment and understanding of interactions (biophysical, political and economic, across scales and sectors etc.) explicit in the subsequent interpretation of those data (an issue relating to the capacity to carry out this interpretation). In contrast, in modelling, data are required to develop and use the model (relating to the category ‘Capacity’) while scope and understanding of how systems work form the Content of the model. As a result, model outputs may be shared and used by decision makers without these underlying issues (contained within the model) being considered. Interpretation of results becomes a much more contested space within CCRA, with uncertainty and limitations of knowledge interacting with the sometimes conflicting subjective agendas of stakeholders (

Comparison of the CCRA review and the present study therefore highlights the importance for agricultural CC adaptation modelling of taking better account of ethical issues relating to the presentation of findings, what they include and exclude, and with whom they are shared – i.e., issues relating to the diverse motives, perspectives and values of different societal groups.
