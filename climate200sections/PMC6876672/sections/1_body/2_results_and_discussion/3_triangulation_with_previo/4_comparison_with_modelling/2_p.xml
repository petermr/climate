<p id="p0135">Comparing challenges to grassland modelling and animal health and disease modelling under CC with the workshop data (
 <xref rid="appsec4" ref-type="sec">Appendix D</xref>) revealed two themes highlighted only in relation to CC adaptation (not as wider challenges to modelling). The first was the development of 
 <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> of future adaption (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Novel scenarios</italic> relate to the challenges of model 
 <italic>Scope</italic>, with the difference being between elements of future change provided as model inputs (scenarios) and elements that are endogenous to models (scope). The second theme only arising in relation to CC adaptation was 
 <italic>Management modelling</italic>. However, it is apparent that incorporating all relevant aspects of decision making, including 
 <italic>Cognitive bias</italic>, into models is a general challenge for modellers seeking to represent any form of decision making. Studies of approaches to incorporating management into agricultural models (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Robert et al., 2016</xref>) suggest that technical solutions exist in modelling to characterise adaptation, including constraints and changes that take place over time but, that actually representing proactive management is difficult. The fact that 
 <italic>Management modelling</italic> was not framed as a general challenge in the reviews used in the comparison exercise, may relate to their focus on biophysical challenges, reflecting the implicit nature of decision-making assumptions in biophysical modelling (i.e. as rational responses to biophysical cues with perfect knowledge). This view is reinforced by the consideration in both reviews of 
 <italic>Interactions</italic> between management and biophysical and economic systems, suggesting a greater focus on biophysical impacts and triggers of choices, than on characterisation of the decision-making process itself. Again, although 
 <italic>Interactions</italic> modelling was considered as both a general and an adaptation-specific challenge in the reviews, improving how the 
 <italic>Interactions</italic> of biophysical, economic and management systems are characterised is a general modelling challenge, with only the 
 <italic>Scope</italic> of the systems modelled increasing to facilitate the modelling of novel adaptations. 
 <italic>Data accessibility</italic> was another theme identified as a challenge for both general and CC adaptation modelling in the grassland and livestock health and disease reviews (the need to collate available data on future adaptations). However, overcoming issues of 
 <italic>Data accessibility</italic> (ownership, sharing) is clearly a general challenge for modellers, and no specific elements of it were detailed in the reviews, or the literature.
