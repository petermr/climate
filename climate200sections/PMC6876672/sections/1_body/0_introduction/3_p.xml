<p id="p0040">Modelling is a key tool for characterising the likely environmental, economic, and social impact of CC on agricultural systems but, to reflect reality, models must incorporate adaptive responses to these impacts (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2008</xref>). In relation to any specific modelled system, CC adaptations can be autonomous (responses occurring without external intervention) or, non-autonomous (planned actions taken pre-emptively or due to experience of CC impacts) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">FAO, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reilly and Schimmelpfennig, 2000</xref>). For example, in a regional scale model, autonomous adaptation might include predicted responses of farmers to environmental change (such as altering sowing dates) while a policy decision to fund irrigation systems might be a non-autonomous adaptation investigated by altering model inputs. In addition, modelling strategies investigated as potential CC adaptations might include responses to non-climatic systemic pressures with adaptive or maladaptive consequences (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gr√ºneis et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mitter et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of this study, CC adaptation is defined as including: non-autonomous adaptations, any strategy explored by modellers as a potential CC adaptation, and autonomous human adaptations. Autonomous biophysical responses of the system, and actions not recognised as CC adaptations within a specific modelling exercise, are considered to be part of the context within which CC adaptation occurs.
