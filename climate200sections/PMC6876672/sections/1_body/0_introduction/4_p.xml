The question arises as to whether efforts to model CC impacts and to improve agricultural modelling in general, are sufficient to support adaptive actions by stakeholders and policymakers or, whether there are agricultural modelling challenges specific to CC adaptation and thus requiring focussed attention from researchers and modellers. The aim of the current study was to search for and (if found) define challenges specific to CC adaptation modelling in agriculture. Research was based on the gathering and analysis of agricultural modellers’ views of challenges to modelling agricultural CC adaptation.
