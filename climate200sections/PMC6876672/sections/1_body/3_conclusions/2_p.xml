<p id="p0185">This study sought to answer the question, to what extent is CC adaptation a novel challenge for agricultural modellers? The findings indicate that there are a number of CC adaptation specific aspects to the challenges of adaptation modelling identified by modellers. Within the three challenge categories of Use, Content and Capacity derived from the data, the theme of creating 
 <italic>Novel</italic> (adaptation) 
 <italic>scenarios</italic> was found to be entirely specific to CC adaptation modelling. Seven challenge themes, such as 
 <italic>Resources for modelling</italic> and 
 <italic>Scale interactions</italic>, represented essential pre-requisites for CC adaptation modelling but, were not considered specific to it. Ten other themes were considered general modelling challenges but, with CC adaptation-specific aspects. Most fundamentally, the importance of understanding and managing the influence of model focus, limitations, use and presentation on adaptive responses and their consequences was highlighted for both, bio-economic modellers and biophysical modellers. CC adaptation modelling draws agricultural modellers into social and political contexts in which their approaches and findings affect who wins and who loses, what is valued and what sacrificed, in the adaptation of agriculture to progressive CC. In modelling CC adaptation in agriculture, there is a need for the agricultural modelling community to focus on the aspects of model content and capacity relating to scope, optimisation, and information, on collaboration across disciplines and institutes, and on the responsibilities of modelling evolving responses to progressive CC.
