 <caption> Comparison of challenges identified by participants with themes drawn from Adger et al. (2018) and challenges from Kipling et al. (2016b) and Ozkan et al. (2016). Within the three categories of Use, Content and Capacity defined from the analysis of data, white and grey boxes indicate challenges identified by participants in the current study: i) listed as wider challenges for modelling in reviews (white); ii) in which some element was considered unique to CC adaptation in reviews (light grey); and iii) considered specific to adaptation in reviews (dark grey). Black boxes = challenges only raised in CCRA review. Asterisks = challenges identified by participants, and also in CCRA review. Dashed ovals delineate groupings of challenges contributing to one of the specific CC adaptation modelling challenges depicted in Fig. 3 (denoted by letters A-E). </caption>
