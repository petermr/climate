<p id="p0440">Fewer models link to biophysical animal models, with livestock production often represented via feed budgeting and/or herd dynamics modules (e.g. FAMOS[space], ScotFarm, MODAM) with annual or monthly time steps. Farm-scale bio-economic models might also include integrated cropping or soil processes, exemplified by the incorporation of soil carbon stocks in FarmDesign (

Adaptation modelling is then possible to the extent that CC and adaptation impacts can be translated to the relevant co-efficients in these modules (e.g. change in milk yield or liveweight gain). Solutions for fully integrated livestock and crop production sub-modules also exist; for example, the DairyNZ model takes weather data directly, with pasture and cow metabolism modules operating with a daily time step, and an annual time-step economic module (
