 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¶tter et al., 2018</xref>), making it hard to consider the relative outcomes of adaptation strategies over different time scales. A major challenge is the development of approaches to incorporate carry over effects of management change, for example progressive shifts in sowing dates and how performance in crop rotations alters according to the effects of previous crops in the rotation (
