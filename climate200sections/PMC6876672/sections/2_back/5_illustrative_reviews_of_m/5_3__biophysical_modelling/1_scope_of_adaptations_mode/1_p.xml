<p id="p0460">The focus of many recent crop model inter-comparisons has been on wheat e.g.

 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Martre et al. (2015)</xref> maize and rice (
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Ehrhardt et al., 2018</xref>) and 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¶tter et al. (2018)</xref> have highlighted the need to widen the focus of modelling to cover more systems, including tropical crop production. The effects of CC on pest and disease ecology and spread, and the consequences for different plant species and communities also need to be better incorporated into models as a pre-requisite to simulating the impacts of adaptation strategies focussed on plant health (
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Newbery et al., 2016</xref>). Challenges of model scope and adaptation impact are being tackled in relation to several specific adaptations, including modelling crop rotations (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Kollas et al., 2015</xref>) and CC effects on harvest quality (
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Nuttall et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler and Reynolds, 2013</xref>). The characterisation of intercropping systems and crop mixtures is also challenging with most models currently representing such systems as a single crop, with characteristics based on those of the combined crop. An advance is the characterisation of two species independently, accounting for soil nutrient and light sharing between them, e.g. STICS, 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Corre-Hellou et al. (2009)</xref>. Multi-species grasslands are also likely to be more resilient to CC (
 <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together the need for multi-species modelling for arable and grassland systems creates potential for collaboration with ecological modellers more used to dealing with multi-species swards (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Van Oijen et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work in this area includes the development of dynamic modelling of both species composition and changes in biomass in productive grasslands (
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Moulin et al., 2018</xref>). Grassland models have flexibility through their mechanistic incorporation of a range of biophysical processes, such as plant-grazing animal interactions (
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Graux et al., 2011</xref>). The inclusion of these and other detailed sward processes, along with outputs relating to production, nutrient flows and GHG emissions (
 <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Sanz-Cobena et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrate the scope of such models to characterise adaptive changes via the alteration of input variables by the user.
