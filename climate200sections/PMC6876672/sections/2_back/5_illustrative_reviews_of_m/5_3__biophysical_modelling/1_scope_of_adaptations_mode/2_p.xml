<p id="p0465">As in the case of bio-economic models (section 3.4.2) the scope of farm-scale biophysical models to characterise novel adaptations, is determined by the capabilities of the crop and grass models to which they are linked. Thus, in MELODIE (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2012</xref>) a dynamic model designed to simulate nutrient flows across a mixed farming system, operational (short term, within a season) adaptations associated with crop and grassland management and short term changes in feed rations are incorporated via the STICS crop model. Tactical (annual) adaptations linked with the planning of crop rotations, feed rations, and fertilisation strategy are also simulated using specific sub-models (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2008</xref>). However, farm scale models must also consider adaptations associated with farm infrastructure and resources (e.g. housing, imported feed) and interactions between these systemic components that might produce emergent effects (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Chardon et al., 2012</xref>). Within MELODIE, manpower, machinery and some aspects of animal housing (e.g. control of ventilation, alleviation of heat stress or addition of water to slurry tank) are not included, excluding consideration of related adaptation strategies. Assessing the value of some tactical adaptations like the use of cover crops, changing crop species/varieties, or the implementation of different tillage practices is possible, but only by comparing several (with vs without adaptation) scenarios, and not by simulating such changes in response to external factors. Similarly, some adaptations can be simulated by altering input variables (e.g. change in the calving pattern, use of alternative forages, changes of breeds or changes in manure processing). Inclusion of farm-scale biophysical models in modelling platforms, e.g. MELODIE within the INRA modelling platform (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Bergez et al., 2013</xref>) allow them to benefit from improvements in sub-models. Modular structures for farm-scale models offer an important technical solution to the challenge of characterising a wider scope of novel CC adaptations in both biophysical and bio-economic modelling (
