<p id="p0415">For models such as regional Integrated Land use Models (ILMs) or biophysical models well-specified adaptation strategies may be included as inputs â€“ these are frequently defined by experts. External information can be added about the adaptation (e.g. for ILMs, the regional availability of relevant technology, and the required infrastructure and conditions, such as water availability and institutional settings). Although technical coefficient generators can be used to identify a large range of alternative adaptations; e.g. 
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Janssen et al. (2010)</xref>, information may also be needed on adoption (e.g. in positive mathematical programming models) posing a particular challenge for adaptation measures which are not yet available. At regional level, socio-economic scenarios are being created to consistently define framework conditions for adaptation, improving transparency and comparability in the assumptions underlying model predictions. These include the Regional Agricultural Pathways (RAPs) developed within AgMIP (
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">Valdivia et al., 2013</xref>). RAPs are characterised with input from stakeholders and experts to ensure their coherence and relevance. However, scenarios may still face issues including limitations in the scenario-building approach, the choice of stakeholders and experts from whom to gather data, and the potential for uncritical inclusion of implicit sociological assumptions (
