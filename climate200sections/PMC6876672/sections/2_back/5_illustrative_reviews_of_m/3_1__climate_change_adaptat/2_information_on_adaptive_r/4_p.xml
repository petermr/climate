<p id="p0430">Given the unavoidability of uncertainty about future choices, one approach is to produce a range of outcomes based on different scenarios and adaptation choices which stakeholders can subsequently discuss, rather than ranking outcomes to suggest a recommended ‘best’ action (

Model findings may also be presented in the context of a critical assessment of wider implications of implementation including adaptation effects on social or environmental objectives such farm income, CC mitigation, or water quality; e.g.

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). This feeds into the idea of cycling between biophysical and socio-economic aspects in participatory processes of research, and the creation of adaptive loops to maintain flexibility in the face of changing conditions (

 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Star et al., 2016</xref>), provided a matrix of approaches that can be aligned with different roles for modelling, which may: support stakeholders in determining adaptation strategies that help them meet the (normative) objectives they desire, provide a range of (exploratory) outcomes for them to consider, present them with a recommended (normative) outcome, or finally, provide a range of strategies that they would like models to explore. Engagement with experts in scenario planning can therefore address issues relating to gathering information on future conditions, with different approaches supporting modellers in tackling the challenge of Responsibilities of modelling in the context of progressive change (
