<p id="p0355">Challenge of dealing with the wide and interacting impacts of climate change and adaptive responses, including the key integration of biophysical and socio-economic aspects of exposure and vulnerability, and the linking of disaster risk management and CC adaptation expertise. Challenges for research and decision makers at policy level can be addressed by considering the experiences of CCRA in specific sectors, and approaches used to address other complex issues can also be learned from. CCRA approaches for infrastructure and business risks are mentioned as methodological advances relating to specific sectors. Stakeholders can provide expert knowledge to complement scientific understanding. Links across disciplines need to be integrated with links to the needs of adaptation policymakers at a strategic level.</p>
