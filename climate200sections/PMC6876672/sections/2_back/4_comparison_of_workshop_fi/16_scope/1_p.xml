<p id="p0370">The scope of an CCRA can affect how it is used and how risks are perceived, as well as affecting the accuracy with which incorporated risks are assessed. More recent CCRAs have incorporated socio-economic drivers of vulnerability and CCRAs are being widened to incorporate climate change opportunities to improve balance in decision making. There has been recognition of issues relating to impacts and adaptive responses that cross political borders (relates also to interdependence) and how these can affect risk and adaptive responses. Inclusion of the impact of current adaptation actions on future risk, from policy aspirations to action and adaptive capacity is important, including how different policy drivers might interact with adaptation needs to positively (or negatively) effect risk. Finally, a need to characterise risks and issues related to different coping potentials was identified. Scope interacts with expectations of what CCRAs should provide for policy makers, as well as what they incorporate into their conclusions, with an emphasis on the need to engage with policy and implementation in addition to publishing reports. The review also highlights a modelling challenge also raised by modellers â€“ that the variety and diversity of adaptations is a challenge for integrated assessment models that do not incorporate all the required parameters or interactions.</p>
