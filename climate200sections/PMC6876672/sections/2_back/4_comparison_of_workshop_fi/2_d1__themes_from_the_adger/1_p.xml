 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al. (2018)</xref> review, gathering it into intuitive groupings that enabled easier comparison with the challenges identified in the current study. The themes were extracted from the paper using a thematic coding approach (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>). Themes were then compared with challenges identified by modellers in the workshops, to highlight any CC adaptation-specific issues that modellers also need to tackle (gaps in coverage of identified adaptation modelling challenges). How the CCRA for adaptation policy themes, and those identified by modellers, overlapped and complemented each other, is described in section D2 and
