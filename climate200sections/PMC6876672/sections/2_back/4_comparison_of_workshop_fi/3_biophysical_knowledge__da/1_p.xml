<p id="p0305">Biophysical systems will respond to climate change in complex ways that interact across systems and over different time scales, including feedback effects on climate change itself; these interactions are not fully understood, including for example potential for critical transitions. Recent studies provide improved assessments of the extent to which specific events can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and predictions about the magnitude and frequency of extreme events.</p>
