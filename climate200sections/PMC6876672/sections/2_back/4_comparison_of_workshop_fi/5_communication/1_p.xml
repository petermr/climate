<p id="p0315">The challenge of communicating uncertainties, assumptions and limitations, given that the choice of adaptive response is often controversial and liable to scrutiny is important to address. This includes the need to avoid over-technical approaches that might not fit well with some examples of risk, to explain constraints in order to avoid the development of unrealistic expectations around outcomes, to ensure the relevance of outcomes to decision makers (e.g. focussing on urgency, relating risks to current policy outcomes). The presentation of CCRAs can affect their effectiveness in stimulating change; examples from text were the assessment of risks associated with current policy, and how current objectives might be threatened by climate change, and the use of risk registers that use the dimensions of likelihood and impact to bring together, rank, highlight and communicate a range of risks. Transparency and close engagement with users of CCRA outputs are highlighted.</p>
