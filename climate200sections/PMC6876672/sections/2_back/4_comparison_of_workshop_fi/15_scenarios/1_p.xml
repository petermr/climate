Scenarios can be used to represent diverse pathways exceeding those accessible through conventional prediction, facilitating understanding of the consequences of change. Presenting a range of scenarios (including extremes) is also a strategy to deal with uncertainty in predictions (see ‘Uncertainty’).</p>
