<p id="p0220">Participants identified issues of a lack of interaction and understanding between modellers in different communities – for example, between disease modellers and other agricultural systems modellers as a particular issue: “Disease modellers do not consider other modelling groups as potential users of their models/outputs. There is a gap between the modelling communities - important challenge for modelling adaptation”. And a lack of interaction between empirical researchers and modellers was also raised as a challenge: “No insight or insufficient insight on data availability from other disciplines”. Several participants highlighted the need for work across disciplines, and this was associated with the need to provide models that met the requirements of users: “Linking groups 'interdisciplinarity' to ensure models are fit for purpose for the end user”. Collaboration is underpinned by the need to improve how information about models (source codes etc.) is shared between researchers.</p>
