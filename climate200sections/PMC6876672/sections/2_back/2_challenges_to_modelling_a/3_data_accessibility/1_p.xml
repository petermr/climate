<p id="p0205">This theme relates to data ownership and its effect on the ability to use data that have been collected for modelling work. Data has a value to those who hold it, which may mean that it is not used to the full extent possible: “Intellectual property and 'turf'; secrecy and privacy: often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and/or obtain cash and rights” Limited accessibility may also be a more straightforward issue of communication and knowledge, with modellers who have many demands on their time looking for: “Data capture from readily available sources to reduce time spent getting outputs” To tackle this challenge, the need for shared resources was highlighted: “Inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information“</p>
