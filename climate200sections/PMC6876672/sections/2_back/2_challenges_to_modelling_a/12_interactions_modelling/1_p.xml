<p id="p0250">This theme encompasses challenges relating to i) a lack of underlying understanding of the interactions between factors and mechanisms in agricultural systems: “Too many interacting factors and interacting mechanisms are still not well enough understood to be modelled (e.g heat stress on animal productivity includes many confounding effects and studies generally do not separate these effects sufficiently” ii) challenges relating to the computational power required in characterising complex interactions involving a number of inter-dependent types of mechanism: “Computability: To integrate inter-dependent: sectors, scales (spatial) ecosystem services, scales (temporal) adaptations, future scenario space, uncertainty etc.”. These issues relate to biophysical interactions: “Grassland models are not able to simulate the diversity of species and inter-specific interactions that characterise grasslands”, to economic and management interactions – such as the cost/availability of novel options and the changes in management required when they are implemented: “Cost and availability of new technologies (e.g. breeds, soil management options). Also including the change in management required (e.g. new feed regime for new breeds)” and, to the effects of implementation on the biophysical system: “The application of fertilisers and its effects is highly complex, for example interactions in the soil and in relation to climate change”, and finally to feedback, arising from management changes: “Incorporate adaptation strategies adequately into models at all: in a way that allows you to study feedbacks and side effects without prescribing too many of them as inputs, and that reflects the technical characteristics of the measure”.</p>
