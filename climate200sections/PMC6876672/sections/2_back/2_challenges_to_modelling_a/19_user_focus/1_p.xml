<p id="p0285">These challenges related to the need to ensure models and their outputs were mindful of the needs of stakeholders, who may differ from modellers in relation to the timescale they are considering, or type of questions they want answered: “Policy makers are asking ‘How do we do X?’ while scientists are answering ‘What happens if?’ questions – this can create communication problems”. The theme includes the challenge of providing tailored models: “Cooling, ventilation: Adaptation designs are very farm-specific, e.g. requirement for a very detailed design and approach”. To the extent of modelling on demand: “Applied research by demand (i.e. farmer associations demanding to play with their real data)”. Modellers need to consider who their users are and what they need, and working with them can be part of achieving this: “Define end users, target groups and work with them throughout”. Finally, some participants referred to the need to ensure that outputs were interpreted correctly: “Distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive (normative) information and results”.</p>
