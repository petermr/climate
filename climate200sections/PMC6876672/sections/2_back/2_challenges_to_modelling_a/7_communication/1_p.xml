<p id="p0225">Modelling can produce complex findings that are a challenge to communicate to end users, with certain procedures not intuitively understandable for non-modellers: “Comprehensible sensitivity analysis”. Participants recognised the importance of communication skills in relation to ensuring outputs are easy to take in for different groups: “Policy makers want to receive a simplified summary of key outputs, not to be given complex model details. Other stakeholders also require simplified outputs. How can we make material digestible for stakeholders?” “How to communicate suggested feed changes to farmers”. Communication skills were emphasized as a challenge: “The process of transferring information might limit its accessibility [for stakeholders]. Care is needed in the communication process”. And also the importance of more integrated engagement to enable users and modellers to understand each other better: “Organising dynamic learning and communication processes”.</p>
