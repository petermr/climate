<p id="p0260">Under climate change models will be faced with the need to characterise new circumstances and their impacts: “Under climate change, relationships between variables may not remain the same (e.g. under more extreme conditions than tested for) and we need to try to understand these potential changes” One challenge is to represent the impacts of climate change on the biophysical system: “Differential effect of increasing CO2 on mixed swards”. And their downstream impacts on production: “Roughage quality analysis not future proof (mixed sward quality under climate change)”. On top of this, is the need to then understand how the implementation of adaptation options will affect such changed systems: “Model limitations for allocating land to feed types (plus protein feeds?) e.g. forage versus cereal crops (adaptation through changing feeding patterns)”. This may include the introduction of new production options: “Nitrogen cycle: To create a zero sum long term N balance - what happens in a semi-arid soil? What happens under agro forestry? What happens in ley plus arable?”.</p>
