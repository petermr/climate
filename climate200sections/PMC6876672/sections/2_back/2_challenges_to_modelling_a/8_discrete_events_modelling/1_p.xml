<p id="p0230">One-off or extreme events are shocks to a system that may be hard to predict: “Risk and timing of extreme events”. And the effects of which may alter both, future states of the system, and the ability of decision makers to implement adaptation options: “The length and severity of extreme events may limit available management choices, and this is hard to model (e.g. a model may usually apply irrigation in a drought, but previous droughts, or a long drought may mean that irrigation water is not available”. Discrete events also include the challenge of modelling ‘threshold’ changes in behaviour – the appearance and implementation of a new disruptive technology or the point at which stakeholders move from adaptation of current systems to transformation to new systems – in relation to causes, timing and impacts of such changes: “Disruptive technology: One of the areas where the struggle is predicting the arrival of disruptive technology partly because it is behavioural (for example, a transition to food derived from bio-reactors)”.</p>
