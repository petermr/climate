Abstract</div> <div class="objective(s):" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Objective(s):</div> <p> <i>Pycnocycla bashagardiana</i> is an endemic species found only in Iran. Due to the presence of myristicin as the major component of the fruit’s oil we were prompted to assess the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruit’s essential oil (PBFEO). </p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and Methods:</div> <p>The analgesic activities of PBFEO (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) were studied by hot-plate and formalin tests in mice. Control and standard groups received vehicle and morphine (5 mg/kg, IP), respectively. The acute anti-inflammatory effect of PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg, IP) were assessed by carrageenan-induced paw edema method in 30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after carrageenan injection and the chronic anti-inflammatory effect of PBFEO (50 and 100 mg/kg, IP) were assessed by the cotton pellet-induced granuloma method in rats. </p> </div> <div class="results:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results:</div> <p>In hot-plate and formalin tests, the studied doses of PBFEO were not effective. However, in carrageenan test, all studied doses of PBFEO significantly reduced the paw edema in comparison to the control animals ( <i>P</i>&amp;lt;0.05). Anti-inflammatory activity of PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg, <i>P</i>&amp;lt;0.05) was found to be more than mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg). In cotton pellet-induced granuloma, PBFEO was also effective regarding the transudate and granuloma formation amount. PBFEO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 12 constituents, representing 96.0% of the oil, were identified. The major component of the oil was characterized as myristicin which might be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion:" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Plants belonging to the Apiaceae family are rich in secondary metabolites and embody numerous genera of high economic and medicinal value, yielding flavonoids, coumarins, acetylenes, terpenes, and essential oils ( <a href="#ref1">1</a>). It is well known that the existence of essential oils and oleoresin is a characteristic feature of this family ( <a href="#ref2">2</a>). <i>Pycnocycla</i> is a genus belonging to the Apiaceae family, subfamily Apioideae, tribe Echinophoreae, and comprises approximately 20 species of herbaceous perennial, multicaulis, and spinous plants widely distributed in subtropical and tropical regions ( <a href="#ref3">3</a>). <i>Pycnocycla</i> is characterized by eight species in Iran, all of which are native or endemic ( <a href="#ref4">4</a>). <i>Pycnocycla bashagardiana</i> Mozaff. is an endemic species found only in the south of Iran. It is commonly distributed in the Jask County, Hormozgan Province ( <a href="#ref4">4</a>). Due to the widespread use of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruits in Iranian traditional medicine for relief and treatment of pain and inflammation-based disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, we were prompted to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of the fruit’s essential oil and examine the pharmacological basis for the folkloric use of it as an antinociceptive and anti-inflammation agent. As the fruits of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> contain a high amount of essential oils (1.6%, v/w) and possess a strong smell, we were prompted to evaluate the mentioned effects of its essential oil for the first time. The <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruit’s essential oil (PBFEO) was also analyzed by Gas chromatography and GC-MS in order to detect the potentially responsible compounds for observed activities. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Plant material and preparation of essential oil</div> <p>Fresh fruits of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> were collected in September 2014 from Bashagard village, Jask County, Hormozgan Province, Iran: (25°38’38″N, 57°46’28″E, 900 m). Specimens were identified by N Kazemivash and the voucher was deposited in the Herbarium of Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAUPS), Tehran, Iran, under code numbers 5067- AUPF. Fruits were subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hr. At the end of distillation, the oil was collected, dried with anhydrous Na <sub>2</sub>SO <sub>4</sub>, measured, and transferred to a clean glass vial and kept (−18 °C) for biological and analytical tests. </p> </div> <div class="animals" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Animals</div> <p>Male Wistar rats weighing 150–200 g and male NMRI mice (20–30 g) were used in present study. Animals were kept in groups of six per standard cage, on 12 hr light/dark cycle, and the air temperature was maintained at 22±2 °C. Experiments reported in this study were carried out in accordance with local guidelines for the care of laboratory animals of Faculty of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University (IAUPS). </p> </div> <div class="analgesicactivityofpbfeo" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Thermal method Hot-plate test in mice</div> <p>The hot-plate procedure was employed for the purpose of preferential assessment of the possible centrally mediated analgesic effect of PBFEO ( <a href="#ref5">5</a>). Animals were individually placed on a controlled hot-plate maintained at 55±0.2 °C. Briefly, the animals were placed on the hot-plate apparatus and latency to licking or shaking of the paws or jumping was recorded. PBFEO (50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, IP) was given to the separate group by intraperitoneal injection. Morphine (5 mg/kg) and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg) were also administered by the same route. The latency was recorded before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following intraperitoneal administration of the agents and is expressed as the percentage of maximal possible effect (MPE). MPE% = 100% <i>×</i> (postdrug latency <i>−</i> predrug latency) <i>÷</i> (cutoff <i>−</i> predrug latency). A 15 sec cutoff time was used to prevent tissue damage. </p> </div> <div class="chemicalmethodformalintestinmice" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Chemical method Formalin test in mice</div> <p>The analgesic effects of PBFEO were investigated by formalin test. 30 min after separate injection of different doses of the essential oil (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg, positive control) and the vehicle, formalin (50 µl of 2.5%) was injected into the hind paw of the mice. Scoring of nociceptive behaviors began after formalin injection and was continued for 60 min. A nociceptive score was recorded for each five-minute time block by measuring the amount of time spent in each of the following behavioral types: 3, the injected paw was licked, bitten, or shaken; 2, the injected paw was elevated; 1, the injected paw had little or no weight placed on it; and 0, the injected paw was not favored. Pain rating ranging from zero to three, was calculated ( <a href="#ref6">6</a>). Individual time course determinations in the formalin test were changed to area-under-the-curve values, zero to ten min after formalin injection (AUC phase ?) and 10–60 min after formalin injection (AUC phase ??) ( <a href="#ref6">6</a>). </p> </div> </div> <div class="anti-inflammatoryactivityofpbfeo" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats</div> <p>Acute anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on the basis of paw edema inhibition induced by the injection of carrageenan (0.1 ml 2%) into the sub-plantar region of the right hind paw of the rats ( <a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>). Male rats were divided into four different groups of six animals each that separately received PBFEO (200 and 400 mg/kg), mefenamic acid (30 mg/kg), and the sweet almond oil as a vehicle (10 ml/kg, IP) 1 hr before the injection of carrageenan. The paw volume was measured 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after the carrageenan administration using a plethysmometer (model PM 4500, Borj Sanat Co, Iran). Anti-inflammatory activity was revealed as the inhibition percent of the edema when compared with the control group. The percentage inhibition of edema was measured by the following equation: % inhibition of edema= 100 [(Vcontrol –Vtest)/Vcontrol]. </p> </div> <div class="cottonpellet-inducedgranuloma" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Cotton pellet-induced granuloma</div> <p>The chronic anti-inflammatory activity of PBFEO was measured on the basis of cotton pellet-induced granuloma according to the method of Winter and Porter ( <a href="#ref9">9</a>). Four groups of six rats were used. Pellets weighing just about 60 mg each were made with 5 mm of dental cotton tampons. The pellets were sterilized in an autoclave for 30 min at 120 °C under 15 lb pressure. Rats were anesthetized and pellets were subcutaneously implanted in the axilla region of each rat through a single needle incision. Each group was treated daily, for 7 consecutive days with PBFEO (50 and 100 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg), and vehicle (sweet almond oil, 10 ml/kg), IP. On the eighth day, rats were anesthetized over again; the cotton pellets together with the granuloma tissues were separated surgically and made free from extraneous tissues. The wet pellets were weighed for the purpose of the wet weight, and then dried in an incubator at 60 °C for 18 hr until a constant weight was obtained; after that, the dried pellets were weighed for a second time. The exudates’ quantity (mg) was calculated by subtracting the constant dry weight of the pellet from the immediate wet weight of the pellet. Dry weight of granuloma was calculated after deducting the weight of the cotton pellet from the constant dry weight of the pellet and taken as an amount of granuloma tissue formation.

Discussion</div> <p>Pain management is undoubtedly one of the most common and yet most difficult aspects in medicine. In spite of important development in the field of synthetic drugs during recent years, they are found to have many side effects, while plants still hold their own unique place, by the way of having the least side effects. Therefore, a systematic method should be used to find out the efficacy of plants against inflammation and pain so as to use them as herbal anti-inflammatory drugs. </p> <p>In this study, we assessed the antinociception and anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil from the fruits of <i>P. bashagardiana</i>. It is the first report describing the anti-inflammatory activities of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruits in acute and chronic inflammation. Carrageenan-induced edema has been usually presented as an acute inflammation model in the experimental animal. It is well known that carrageenan-induced paw edema is regarded by biphasic episode with the involvement of inflammatory mediators. In the first phase (for the duration of the first 2hr after carrageenan injection), chemical mediators such as histamine and serotonin play a role, while in the second phase (3– 4 hr after carrageenan injection) kinins and prostaglandins are implicated ( <a href="#ref11">11</a>). </p> <p>Our results revealed that administration of PBFEO inhibited edema starting after half an hour and during all phases of inflammation, which is possibly inhibition of different aspects and chemical mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins. The inhibitory activity shown by PBFEO during a period of 4 hr in carrageenan-induced inflammation was in some way more efficient than that revealed by the group treated with mefenamic acid as standard drug. </p> <p>The cotton-pellet granuloma is a widely used manner for the calculation of chronic anti-inflammatory substances ( <a href="#ref12">12</a>). The dry weight of the pellet correlates with the amount of granulomatous tissues, the moist weight of the pellets correlates with transuda. Chronic inflammation happens by means of the development of proliferating cells. These cells can be either spread or in granuloma form. PBFEO (100 mg/kg) indicated significant anti-inflammatory activity in cotton pellet induced granuloma and thus found to be effective in chronic inflammatory conditions, which shows its efficacy in inhibiting the increase in the number of fibroblasts and synthesis of collagen and mucopolysaccharides during granuloma tissue formation. </p> <p>Heat-induced and formalin-induced pain models were used in the present study in order to assess the anti-nociceptive effect of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruit essential oil in experimental mice. Formalin test consists of two phases; the first phase (neurogenic pain) is caused by direct chemical stimulation of nociceptive afferent fibers, predominantly C fibers, which can be suppressed by opiates like morphine ( <a href="#ref13">13</a>). The second phase (inflammatory pain) results from the action of such inflammatory mediators as prostaglandins, serotonin, and bradykinin in peripheral tissues and also from functional changes in the spinal dorsal horn ( <a href="#ref14">14</a>). The associated effects, observed after using different doses of PBFEO, did not show any significant anti-nociception properties in both phases, compared to the control group. The hot-plate test was also used as a thermal nociception model to define the central anti-nociceptive activity of PBFEO. It did not practically increase the reaction time of animals against the thermal stimulus; even the lowest tested dose induced hyperalgesia. Furthermore, in agreement with the results of the first phase of the formalin test, the essential oil did not display an analgesic effect in contrast to morphine. Thus, it could be concluded that the essential oil does not have anti-nociceptive properties. </p> <p>The second phase of the formalin test indicates the effect of the drug on the inflammation process. In the present study, no reduction in pain behaviors was observed. It is assumed that the essential oil of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruit contains a substance that directly stimulates pain receptors in addition to formalin-induced pain. However, despite the reduction of inflammation in animals, there are painful irritations that make them show different pain behaviors. </p> <p>The phytochemical results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effects of PBFEO may be due to its myristicin content. The major constituent of the oil was myristicin (76.1%). It was observed that myristicin comprised more than three-fourths of the oil composition. The anti-inflammatory activity of myristicin has been previously examined on RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid in mice ( <a href="#ref13">13</a>), and since the results have shown marked anti-inflammatory activity, it could be concluded that the observed activities of the studied oil were related to its high content of myristicin. Lee and Park ( <a href="#ref13">13</a>) demonstrated that myristicin could inhibit the production of several inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-10. Since NO is believed to be a major pro-inflammatory mediator related to the bacterial and viral infections, obtained results suggest that the studied myristicin rich essential oil might have anti-inflammatory activity against the pathologic and excessive production of NO in virus-stimulated macrophages and monocytes ( <a href="#ref13">13</a>). Excessive production of IL-6 often correlates with some inflammatory autoimmune diseases including Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis ( <a href="#ref14">14</a>). IL-10 has also been implicated in promoting the pathobiology of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and encephalomyelitis ( <a href="#ref15">15</a>). These results justified the use of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> fruits in traditional medicine. Therefore, PBFEO could be a potential candidate as an anti-inflammatory agent in the management of inflammation-based disorders. </p> <p>Also, we used formalin and a heat-induced pain model for assessing the anti-nociceptive effect of <i>P. bashagardiana</i> essential oil in experimental mice. Our data demonstrated that <i>PBFEO</i> did not produce an antinociceptive effect in mice subjected to both the acute thermal (hot plate) and chronic (persistent) formalin pain stimuli. </p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p> <i>P. bashagardiana</i> essential oil has an inflammatory activity against acute and chronic inflammation in rats. This effect could be related to the high content of myristicin in this essential oil. </p> </div> <div class="conflictsofinterest" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
