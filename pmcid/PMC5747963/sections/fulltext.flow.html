Abstract</div> <p>Chronic wounds and severe burns are diseases responsible for severe morbidity and even death. Wound repair is a crucial process and tissue regeneration enhancement and infection prevention are key factors to minimize pain, discomfort, and scar formation. The aim of this work was the development of lipid nanoparticles (solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers [NLC]), to be loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary essential oils and to be used, as medical devices, to enhance healing of skin wounds. Lipid nanoparticles were based on natural lipids: cocoa butter, as solid lipid, and olive oil or sesame oil, as liquid lipids. Lecithin was chosen as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to prevent their aggregation. The systems were prepared by high shear homogenization followed by ultrasound application. Nanoparticles were characterized for physical–chemical properties, bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward normal human dermal fibroblasts. Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was evaluated against two reference microbial strains, one of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, the other of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. Finally, the capability of nanoparticles to promote wound healing in vivo was evaluated on a rat burn model. NLC based on olive oil and loaded with eucalyptus oil showed appropriate physical–chemical properties, good bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward fibroblasts, associated to antimicrobial properties. Moreover, the in vivo results evidenced the capability of these NLC to enhance the healing process. Olive oil, which is characterized by a high content of oleic acid, proved to exert a synergic effect with eucalyptus oil with respect to antimicrobial activity and wound repair promotion. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Wound repair is one of the most complex physiologic processes, involving a multitude of different cell types, the contribution of which is tightly regulated over time. The breakdown of such a complex path could result in wound healing failure, leading to nonhealing wounds. The typical path of wound repair includes overlapping stages of inflammation, new tissue generation, and subsequent remodeling of neoformed tissue. These stages take place over dramatically different timescales, lasting from minutes (initial clotting and coagulation) to several months or even years. <a href="#b1-ijn-13-175">1</a>, <a href="#b2-ijn-13-175">2</a> </p> <p>Chronic wounds (including venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, arterial insufficiency, and pressure ulcers) determine severe morbidity and even mortality especially in older individuals, in particular those affected from diabetes mellitus and vascular diseases. In addition, surgery, more common in older population, presents risk of wound complication. In general, chronic wounds deeply affect quality of life and wound care requires high costs of therapy. <a href="#b3-ijn-13-175">3</a> </p> <p>Resident cells are less proliferating in chronic wounds and possess a morphology similar to that of senescent cells. In particular, fibroblasts of chronic wounds (long-lasting vascular leg ulcers) are characterized by a poorer response to platelet-derived growth factor, altered capability of transforming growth factor beta type II receptor expression, and abnormal phosphorylation of critical signal transduction proteins. Such features are typical of cells exposed to low oxygen tension, suggesting that chronic wounds are hypoxic. <a href="#b3-ijn-13-175">3</a> </p> <p>The effect of microbial burden on healing of chronic wound is not completely understood and it is probably underestimated. <a href="#b2-ijn-13-175">2</a> The presence of a biofilm was indicated as a critical factor and a correlation between depth and duration of the lesion and the presence of <i>Staphylococcus</i> strains was demonstrated. <a href="#b4-ijn-13-175">4</a> Moreover, microbial wound colonization (typically due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, and some <i>Clostridium</i> strains) was proved responsible for a further delay in wound recovery. <a href="#b5-ijn-13-175">5</a> </p> <p>Burns are skin wounds that can affect a significant portion of the body. Prevention of microbial infection and scar formation are key factors for wound healing. <a href="#b6-ijn-13-175">6</a> </p> <p>Many efforts to enhance the effectiveness of wound healing process have been focused on boosting the antimicrobial activity of topically applied devices, preventing infections, promoting tissue regeneration, and minimizing pain, discomfort, and scar formation. </p> <p>In the last decades, the occurrence of multiresistant bacteria poses a serious problem worldwide, making a challenge the choice of appropriate treatment for patients affected with infected lesions. <a href="#b7-ijn-13-175">7</a> </p> <p>Natural products including β-glucans, aloe, honey, and especially essential oils (EOs) have been proposed as antibacterial agents. <a href="#b8-ijn-13-175">8</a> In particular, EOs are known to possess antimicrobial effect against multiresistant bacteria, thanks to a broad spectrum of biologic and antimicrobial activity. <a href="#b9-ijn-13-175">9</a> </p> <p>EOs are volatile products produced by the secondary metabolism of plants, are extracted from nonwoody part (flowers, seeds, leaves, fruits, and roots), and are mainly composed of terpenes and terpenoids and aromatic and aliphatic constituents. <a href="#b10-ijn-13-175">10</a> </p> <p>Eucalyptus leaf extracts (EO from eucalyptus tree, belonging to the family of Myrtaceae) demonstrated various biologic effects, such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, antihyperglycemic, and antioxidant activities; 1,8-cineole or eucalyptol is the most important component, responsible for bioactive properties. <a href="#b11-ijn-13-175">11</a> </p> <p>Rosemary EO (from <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>, belonging to the family of Lamiaceae), which is mainly composed of camphor, 1,8-cineole, borneol, verbenone, α-pinene, and camphene, has been historically used as an antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant agent. <a href="#b12-ijn-13-175">12</a>– <a href="#b14-ijn-13-175">14</a> </p> <p>All EOs are unstable volatile compounds and are easily degradable (by oxidation, volatilization, heating, and light): encapsulation in nanosystems should, therefore, represent a useful tool to enhance their stability and improve antibacterial activity. <a href="#b15-ijn-13-175">15</a> </p> <p>Giving these premises, the aim of this work was the development of lipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), to be loaded with eucalyptus or rosemary EOs and to be used, as medical devices, to enhance healing of skin wounds. </p> <p>Lipid nanoparticles were based on natural lipids: cocoa butter, as solid lipid, and olive oil or sesame oil, as liquid lipids. Lecithin was chosen as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to prevent their aggregation. The systems were prepared by high shear homogenization followed by ultrasound application. </p> <p>Nanoparticles were characterized for physical–chemical properties, bioadhesion, cytocompatibility, in vitro proliferation enhancement, and wound healing properties toward normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Antimicrobial activity of nanoparticles was evaluated against two reference microbial strains, one of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, the other <i>of Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. Finally, the capability of nanoparticles to promote wound healing in vivo was evaluated on a rat burn model. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Lipid nanoparticle preparation</div> <p>Lipid nanoparticles were prepared by high shear homogenization followed by ultrasound application to avoid agglomeration during cooling. <a href="#b16-ijn-13-175">16</a>, <a href="#b17-ijn-13-175">17</a> </p> <p>Cocoa butter (225 mg) was used as lipid phase for SLNs, whereas NLCs were based on a lipid phase made of cocoa butter (150 mg) mixed with olive oil (75 mg) or sesame oil (75 mg). </p> <p>Each lipid phase was melted at 40°C and eucalyptus or rosemary EO (75 mg) was added. The total amounts of lipid components were the same for SLN and NLC. </p> <p>An aqueous phase (12.5 mL) containing lecithin (150 mg) was heated to 40°C and poured into the lipid phase under homogenization at 24,000 rpm for 5 min with an UltraTurrax equipment (T25, IKA, Labortechnik, Denmark).

Three circular full-thickness burns, having a diameter of 4 mm, were produced on the back of the animals by contact with an aluminum rod (105°C for 40 s). Twenty-four hours later, the formed blisters were removed using a 4-mm diameter biopsy punch to obtain full-thickness lesions.

Some scattered collagen fibers were present at the border with epidermis, while in the reticular layer of the dermis, the typical large bundles of collagen (white arrow) were already formed. </p> <p>In correspondence with the wound treated with NLC o/e suspension containing 5% w/w pull ( <a href="#f8-ijn-13-175">Figure 8C</a>), skin appeared completely re-epithelized, and epidermis (bracket) was well organized in multiple cell layers, with a fair degree of keratinization, similar to the structures observed in the section obtained from wound treated with NLC o/e ( <a href="#f8-ijn-13-175">Figure 8B</a>). Dermal papillae (white star) were in developing phase; furthermore, granulation tissue (arrows) and dilated vessels (black star) were present in a limited area, while collagen fibers were organized in large bundles, typical of the reticular layer of the dermis (white arrow). </p> <p>Normal skin ( <a href="#f8-ijn-13-175">Figure 8D</a>) was characterized by epidermis (bracket), well organized in multiple cell layers, with a fair degree of keratinization and showed numerous dermal papillae (white star). Dermal layer was characterized by large bundles of collagen fibers (white arrow) and showed a lot of dermal appendages (white triangle), such as sebaceous glands and hair bulbs. </p> <p>In summary, NLC e/o suspension containing pull promoted an excellent healing, with a good re-epithelization and stratum corneum formation. Although in the underlying connective tissue, skin appendages were vacant, collagen fibers were organized in large bundles typical of the reticular layer of the dermis. Moreover, dermal papillae began to reform. There was only a mild inflammatory infiltrate, visible in a small portion in the center of the wound. </p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>NLC based on cocoa butter and olive oil, as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, and loaded with eucalyptus oil (NLC o/e) were prepared by high shear homogenization and ultrasound method. Lecithin was used as surfactant to stabilize nanoparticles and to avoid their aggregation. NLC o/e was characterized by a PS of 200–300 nm and demonstrated to be physically stable up to 3 months (2–8°C). It showed good bioadhesive properties, probably determined by NLC flexibility, which could promote interaction with the biologic substrate and the consequent bioadhesive joint formation; this is an important feature to allow an intimate contact between formulation and lesion, to assure treatment efficacy. NLC o/e showed good biocompatibility and proliferation properties toward normal human fibroblasts in an in vitro wound healing model. These properties could be due to the presence of olive oil, a fatty acid with a high content of oleic acid, already known for its good proliferation enhancement potential. </p> <p>Encapsulation of eucalyptus oil in NLC did not impair its antimicrobial properties against two gram-positive bacterial strains commonly present in the skin ( <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>). </p> <p>The results of in vivo rat burn model represented a proof of concept of efficacy and safety of NLC o/e developed. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
