  <p>Flow diagram of the impacts of climate change and human activities on coral reefs from individuals to populations, communities, ecosystem functioning and socialecological systems (green), and coral reef organisms’ responses to mitigate the effects of climate change (orange). The direct impacts of climate change and local human activities on individuals can be multiplied through changes to physiology, behaviour and, therefore, reproduction, and this, combined with species‐specific responses to climate change (acclimation, adaptation and dispersal) influence populations, communities and ultimately ecosystem functioning. The response of socialecological systems to climate change may also then influence local anthropogenic pressures in unanticipated ways. Management strategies aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change and local anthropogenic pressures, facilitating positive responses to them, and maintaining the resilience of communities and socialecological systems are shown in blue, with dotted blue lines linking management strategies to their level of direct impact on threats, and from organism to socio‐ecological scales.
