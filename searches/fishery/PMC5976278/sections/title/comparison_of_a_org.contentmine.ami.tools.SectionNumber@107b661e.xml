 <div class="title">Comparison of a dynamic ocean management (DOM) approach relative to the existing seasonal PLCA.</div>
 <p>Here, we test two management objectives: a dynamic closure based on a conservative 25% habitat suitability threshold for leatherbacks and a dynamic closure based on the 50% threshold for EcoCast. (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Nine pixels (dark green, outlined in black) had high turtle bycatch risk for 90 or more days of the 2012 fishing season compared to (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) 79 pixels in the 2015 fishing season. In addition, 86% of the pixels with high turtle bycatch risk for 60 or more days of the season were within the PLCA in 2012 compared to 63% of pixels in 2015. Time series of the ratio of DOM to PLCA area for (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) leatherback protection and (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) integrated EcoCast risk prediction highlight the efficacy of a dynamic approach compared to static protection across contrasting years in the California Current.
