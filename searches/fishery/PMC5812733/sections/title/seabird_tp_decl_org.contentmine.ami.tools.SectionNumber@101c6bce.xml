TP declines overall from 4.1 to 3.8 during this period, with the decline from 1950 to the present being twice the rate as before. Where most species showed declines (B to E, G, and H; 63%), two fluctuated over time (D and F; 25%) and one remained remarkably constant (A; 13%). CSSIA, compound specific stable isotope analysis; RTTR, red-tailed tropicbird.
