Whilst numerous relationships and feedback mechanisms between the functional roles of coral reef fishes and reef benthic composition have been investigated, certain key groups, such as the herbivores, are widely suggested to maintain reefs in a coral-dominated state. Examining links between fishes and reef benthos is complicated by the interactions between natural processes, disturbance events and anthropogenic impacts, particularly fishing pressure. This study examined fish assemblages and associated benthic variables across five atolls within the Chagos Archipelago, where fishing pressure is largely absent, to better understand these relationships. We found high variability in fish assemblages among atolls and sites across the archipelago, especially for key groups such as a suite of grazer-detritivore surgeonfish, and the parrotfishes which varied in density over 40-fold between sites. Differences in fish assemblages were significantly associated with variable levels of both live and recently dead coral cover and rugosity. We suggest these results reflect differing coral recovery trajectories following coral bleaching events and a strong influence of &#x02018;bottom-up&#x02019; control mechanisms on fish assemblages. Species level analyses revealed that <italic>Scarus niger</italic>, <italic>Acanthurus nigrofuscus</italic> and <italic>Chlorurus strongylocephalos</italic> were key species driving differences in fish assemblage structure. Clarifying the trophic roles of herbivorous and detritivorous reef fishes will require species-level studies, which also examine feeding behaviour, to fully understand their contribution in maintaining reef resilience to climate change and fishing impacts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002992</institution-id><institution>Department for International Development, UK Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Darwin Initiative Grant 19-027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MS was supported by Coastal Oceans Research and Development Indian Ocean (CORDIO) and a Perivoli Trust fellowship at the University of Oxford; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cordioea.net">http://cordioea.net</ext-link>.

Reef degradation from fishing pressure and climate-change induced coral bleaching and mortality have been invoked to explain patterns in the structure of coral reef fish assemblages across multiple scales in the Indo-Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other studies point to scale dependence in drivers of fish assemblages with geomorphology and biogeography, for example, playing a significant role at larger regional scales, and fishing and reef benthic structure operating at local scales [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding the mechanisms by which these drivers interact and their relative contributions to controlling reef fish assemblages is critical in underpinning conservation planning and effective reef fisheries management.</p><p>One of the dominant paradigms used to explain impacts from the external stressors of climate change and fishing on coral reefs and their fish assemblages revolves around potential shifts from coral to algal-dominated reef states [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Herbivorous fishes have been shown to play a leading role in preventing this shift by controlling algal abundance [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The regulatory pathways involve both resource (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) control of the reef ecosystem. Changes in coral cover represent bottom-up control while top-down control is seen when herbivores are depleted through fishing activities, which can lead to their functional role becoming compromised [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Coral reef fish assemblages are known to vary in relation to several environmental characteristics such as exposure to oceanic conditions, rugosity, depth, benthic composition and recent coral mortality [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Bottom-up control of reef fish populations by reef benthic composition has been well established [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and long-term studies in the Philippines, for example, have shown that this pathway is the primary driver of the herbivorous parrotfishes [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, top-down and bottom-up pathways can either dominate or co-occur, depending on the characteristics within the coral reef ecosystem.</p><p>From a management perspective, it is important to be able to attribute the relative contribution of casual factors driving the structure of reef fish assemblages. The objective of this study was to determine which of a range of largely biotic factors may be driving the structure of reef fish assemblages in the absence of fishing. Our hypothesis was that without the top-down influence of fishing in the Chagos Archipelago the fish assemblages should reflect the relative contribution of natural drivers, both bottom up (e.g. food availability) and top-down (e.g. predation), of fish populations, and one anthropogenic stressor&#x02014;coral mortality related to bleaching events. We also sought to describe the characteristic reef fish assemblages of the atolls of the Chagos Archipelago to build on earlier work that examined fish responses to declines in coral cover caused by the coral bleaching event of 1998 [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and found little change in reef fish species richness except in corallivores [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also examined the abundance and biomass of reef fishes from the full range of trophic groups to test for relationships between trophic group and reef benthic composition and so examine the functional roles of fish species in reef resilience.</p><p>The Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean Territory) is an isolated archipelago of atolls spanning ~60,000 km<sup>2</sup> and 2 degrees of latitude on the north-eastern border of the western Indian Ocean Province [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with an area of ~9,400 km<sup>2</sup> of shallow coral reefs (&#x0003c;40m depth) [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The islands are uninhabited except for the southern-most atoll, Diego Garcia, which is classified as a Permanent Joint Operating Base of the UK and US governments and hosts a US naval support facility. The archipelago, with the exception of Diego Garcia where a recreational fishery is permitted, was declared a no-take marine protected area (MPA) in 2010 by the UK Government [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, reef fish biomass in the Chagos Archipelago is demonstrably one of the highest of any coral reef ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Chagos Archipelago therefore provides an ideal location for investigating the relationship between fish assemblages and variability in reef benthic habitat and typology, in the absence of impacts from fishing and human populations. Our study assumed that reef fish species distributions did not differ biogeographically across the Chagos Archipelago due to the direction of major current systems in the western Indian Ocean (WIO), and the connectivity of the pelagic larvae of most reef fish [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We do, however, recognise that self-recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and local oceanographic dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] within and among atolls of the archipelago may affect larval recruitment patterns. An earlier study reported that reef fish assemblages were highly homogeneous across the northern atolls [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here we use datasets from a range of atolls in the archipelago, from the northernmost atolls to Diego Garcia in the south, to examine variation in the abundance and species structure of fish assemblages, and to identify drivers of this variability.</p><p>By confining this study to an isolated archipelago of reefs that are relatively unfished and free of pollution and development, this study contributes to a better understanding of intact Indian Ocean reef fish assemblages. As such, it provides a regional context for interpreting coral reef fish assemblages in the wider Indian Ocean where anthropogenic impacts are more prevalent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study sites</title><p>We surveyed reef fish assemblages and coral reef benthic assemblages in March 2014 at a total of 13 (fish) and 11 (benthic) sites across 5 atolls in the Chagos Archipelago (decimal minutes: 05.237333 S 71.81498 E to 07.26195 S 72.44333 E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191448.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191448.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

The video aimed for a constant speed (~0.1 m s<sup>-1</sup>), with a 10 min transect within each of four depth zones (25&#x02013;20 m, 20&#x02013;15 m, 15&#x02013;10 m, 10&#x02013;5 m) approximately 1 m above the substrate [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Two dives were conducted at each site which spanned approximately 300 m along the reef edge. In each dive 2&#x02013;3 transects were run parallel to the reef edge (5&#x02013;6 replicate transects in total per site). Transects were placed randomly at different depths to span the depth range of the reef, but a maximum dive depth of 26m was imposed by dive safety regulations. Fish counts at each site therefore had relatively broad depth ranges, depending on the reef profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191448.s001">S1 Table</xref>). This design was used to maximise survey coverage of the fish assemblage on the reef. The fish survey sites corresponded to the dive sites at which the benthic video transects were placed; both methods spanned the same depth range at each site.

We found significant differences in fish assemblage structure among the atolls of the Chagos Archipelago which we attribute to natural environmental drivers and climate change, as reflected in the significant correlations between fish assemblages and reef benthic composition. However, temporal changes before and after coral bleaching events remain unknown; future work on this would greatly enhance interpretation of the results of the current study. We can, however, assume that fishing effects are minimal due to the lack of resident human populations on any of the atolls since the 1960s (with the exception of Diego Garcia) and because of the establishment of a no-take MPA in 2010. Indeed, the Chagos Archipelago is used as a benchmark for largely unfished reefs in the Indian Ocean [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further, our study assumed that reef fish species distributions did not differ biogeographically because of the relatively small geographic range of the Chagos Archipelago fed by the easterly flowing East African Coastal Current and South Equatorial Countercurrent, both emanating from the east African mainland [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the connectivity of the pelagic larvae of most reef fishes [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Of the 110 species in the dataset, there was no apparent disjunct in their distribution between the northern atolls (Peros Banhos, Salomon and Blenheim) and the southern atolls (GCB and Diego Garcia) except for <italic>Acanthurus tristis</italic>, <italic>Chaetodon madagascariensis</italic> and <italic>Chlorurus capistratoides</italic>, which were only found in the south, and <italic>Chaetodon lunula</italic> which was only found in the north. Of these, only <italic>C</italic>. <italic>madagascariensis</italic> was a significant species in the ordination analysis.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Patterns in fish species and benthic communities</title><p>Differences in fish assemblages were significantly correlated with geographic distance between sites; the relative density of the 110 species across the archipelago differed most significantly between atolls. These atoll-scale differences were also apparent in total density and biomass values (12 families), with the highest fish densities recorded on the reefs of the western edge of the GCB, the highest fish biomass recorded at Peros Banhos Atoll and the lowest fish biomass at Diego Garcia Atoll. Reef benthic composition also varied between atolls, most notably in the relative cover of live hard coral, recently dead standing coral and rugosity, and permutation testing showed that these differences were significantly related to fish density (hard and dead standing coral) and fish biomass (hard coral, dead standing coral, rugosity). These results are not surprising since strong positive correlations between fish density or biomass and live hard coral and rugosity, benthic variables that co-vary and reflect reef habitat structural complexity, are widely reported [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191448.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, patterns in the fish assemblages reported here likely reflect bottom-up control.</p><p>A major alteration in the benthic composition of coral reefs across the Indian Ocean occurred following the severe coral bleaching event of 1998 [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This thermal anomaly resulted in a reduction of living coral cover in the Chagos Archipelago from 50&#x02013;75% cover prior to the event to ~10% live coral remaining on all six atolls in 1999 [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, a majority of reef sites across the archipelago recovered rapidly and reached pre-bleaching condition by 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The strong benthic differences between atolls observed in our surveys in 2014 possibly reflect different levels of bleaching and differing recovery patterns following the 1998 event, though with little historic data this remains unknown. However, early reports of highly homogenous fish assemblages across reefs in the northern atolls prior to 1998 [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] suggest that the differences in the structure of the fish assemblages found in 2014 may be recent and could therefore be due to differing recovery patterns.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Fishing effects</title><p>This study was not designed to look at fishing effects because it was based on the premise that there is no reef fishing in Chagos Archipelago, however, there was a small Mauritian fishery targeting grouper (Epinephelidae) and snapper (Lutjanidae), which operated from the 1970s until 2010 when the Chagos MPA was designated [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Populations of piscivore and omnivore trophic categories were similar between atolls, exemplified by the coralgrouper <italic>Plectropomus laevis</italic>, which was abundant and observed at all but three sites. However, two snappers <italic>Lutjanus bohar</italic> (piscivore) and <italic>Lutjanus gibbus</italic> (omnivore) were significantly correlated with differences in fish assemblages across atolls. The highest biomass of these two species was found in Peros Banhos lagoon sites (up to 861 kg/ha and 530 kg/ha, for <italic>L</italic>. <italic>bohar</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>gibbus</italic>, respectively). Apparently, the fishery did not operate in the lagoons (BIOT Fisheries Officer, pers. comm. 2014), but since our study is the first to report on fish biomass in the lagoons there are no previous comparable data. For <italic>L</italic>. <italic>bohar</italic> moderate biomass levels were found on forereefs at Salomon, Peros Banhos and Blenheim, but were lower at Diego Garcia and GCB, while biomass of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>gibbus</italic> was highly variable across all forereefs. Our surveys also suggest that three large species of grouper, <italic>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</italic>, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>multinotatus</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>tauvina</italic> may have been overfished in the past since they were absent at most sites. While there is also some illegal fishing in BIOT, 80% by weight of illegal catches detected by the BIOT patrol vessel is shark [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and therefore this poaching can be considered minimal in terms of impacts on reef fishes. Our results suggest that further research is needed to distinguish between possible latent fishing effects or natural biotic/abiotic drivers of some grouper and <italic>Lutjanus bohar</italic>.</p><p>A recreational fishery operates outside the MPA at the naval base in Diego Garcia and is having an impact on fish biomass [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our total biomass estimates with maximum values of ~3,500 kg/ha (12 families) do not include sharks and trevally and therefore cannot be directly compared with the estimates of &#x0003e;9,000 kg/ha reported from 2010&#x02013;2012. However, comparing relative biomass between atolls from the 2010&#x02013;2012 survey [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with our survey in 2014 shows similar differences, with highest values at Peros Banhos, followed by GCB, then Salomon, and the lowest values at Diego Garcia. This supports Graham et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conclusions that the recreational fishery is having an impact. Nevertheless, we measured extremely high biomass values at 10 of the 13 sites (1,501&#x02013;3,000 kg/ha at six sites, and &#x0003e; 3,000 kg/ha at four sites). These biomass estimates are similar, when the same families are considered, to biomass at other uninhabited and protected reefs of the French territories in the Mozambique Channel [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], providing strong support for using Chagos Archipelago as a reference benchmark for unfished reef fish populations in the WIO.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Trophic dynamics in the reef fish assemblages</title><p>Herbivory and detritivory contribute significantly to the trophic dynamics and hence biomass production on coral reefs [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Indeed, the diversity of herbivores and detritivores seen on modern reefs, illustrated by the parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarinae) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), has been linked to the massive expansion of shallow coral reef habitats over the last 5 million years [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the Chagos Archipelago, the grazer-detritivores was the trophic group that differed most significantly between atolls. This group comprises a suite of acanthurids (&#x0201c;ring-tail&#x0201d; surgeonfishes [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), such as <italic>Acanthurus tennenti</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>xanthopterus</italic>, that harvest mouthfuls of soft sediment on dead coral substrate, as well as on sand, which contain the diatoms and microbes of their diet [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Their highest densities at GCB and Diego Garcia (&#x0003e;500 and &#x0003e;600 individuals/ha, respectively) corresponded with low hard coral cover. In contrast, low numbers of these surgeonfishes were seen at Peros Banhos, Salomon and Blenheim (&#x0003c;130, &#x0003c;14, &#x0003c;170 individuals/ha, respectively), where hard coral cover was high. These results suggest that these &#x0201c;grazer-detritivore&#x0201d; surgeonfish species may thrive where their benthic food sources have increased due to coral mortality [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] so potentially may serve as indicators of reef degradation. The prevalence of the detritivory role is also supported by one of the most common reef fishes in the world, the bristletooth surgeonfishes <italic>Ctenochaetus</italic> spp. [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], with the combined density of two species <italic>Ctenochaetus truncatus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>striatus</italic> of ~850 individuals/ha, the second highest of all the 110 species surveyed (<italic>Caesio</italic> spp. density was the highest: 936 individuals/ha). We propose that the importance of detritivory in recovery of degraded reefs and in cycling carbon within coral reef systems is not well quantified and therefore an important area for future research.</p><p>A strong relationship between hard coral cover and corallivores has been widely reported [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and was confirmed here with significantly higher densities of obligate coral-feeding butterflyfishes at Peros Banhos and Salomon atolls where there was relatively higher live coral cover. These coral specialists are clearly highly vulnerable to coral mortality and, as such, have long been used as potential indicator species for monitoring coral reef health [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The third trophic group that differed significantly between atolls was the planktivores, comprising several acanthurids (three <italic>Naso</italic> spp., <italic>Acanthurus thompsoni</italic> and <italic>Paracanthurus hepatus)</italic>, two chaetodontids, two balistids and <italic>Caesio</italic> spp. The biomass of this group was three times higher at GCB, with a mean biomass of 1,045 kg/ha, compared to 338kg/ha for other atolls, and this was largely due to the caesionids and <italic>Naso hexacanthus</italic> and <italic>N</italic>. <italic>brevirostris</italic>. Further, three planktivores were strongly correlated with the ordination: <italic>Paracanthurus hepatus</italic>, <italic>Acanthurus thompsoni</italic> and the chaetodon <italic>Hemitaurichthys zoster</italic>. Drivers of planktivore populations on coral reefs are still poorly understood, but their food items are associated with reef edges and proximity to deep water [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These acanthurid species are all zooplanktivores [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], suggesting waters at GCB may be zooplankton-rich. Thus, higher Acanthuridae densities overall at GCB reefs appear to reflect two different and unrelated trophic pathways: increased access to soft benthic surfaces due to coral mortality for the grazer-detritivores and higher zooplankton densities for planktivores. Finally, it was notable that the density and biomass of the piscivore and omnivore trophic groups, species that represent important target fishery species [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], were not significantly correlated with fish assemblage patterns across the archipelago, suggesting that benthic differences did not directly affect these higher trophic level taxa. Thus, when data were aggregated by trophic group, only three groups differed significantly and these appeared to be influenced by reduced coral cover due to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and natural variability in zooplankton, both bottom-up control pathways.</p><p>It was surprising that none of the five herbivore trophic groups, which included all the parrotfishes, were significant in explaining differences in fish assemblages between sites. We found species-level analyses were more informative than aggregated trophic group analyses and demonstrated species from within seven trophic groups were highly related to differences in the fish assemblages across the reefs of the Chagos Archipelago. <italic>Scarus niger</italic> had the strongest correlation with fish assemblage structure across the archipelago, with highest biomass on the high coral cover northern atolls (182 kg/ha at Peros Banhos), and the lowest at Diego Garcia and the low coral cover reefs of GCB (3 kg/ha and 11&#x02013;27 kg/ha, respectively). This species is one of the most ubiquitous parrotfishes across the Indo-Pacific [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and feeds on the top 1&#x02013;2 mm of dead coral substrate [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], though it probably removes epilithic algae while feeding. <italic>Scarus niger</italic> was associated with the highly abundant surgeonfish <italic>Acanthurus nigrofuscus</italic>, known to graze similar substrate types but feeding on epilithic algae [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These two species correlated most closely with the assemblages at Salomon Atoll sites, particularly on the outer forereefs where live hard coral, <italic>Acropora</italic> and rugosity were highest, but also at the Peros Banhos lagoon sites where turf algae and dead coral were relatively high. This result may reflect &#x0201c;feeding complimentarity&#x0201d; by a parrotfish and a surgeonfish, accessing different algal prey within the same benthic substrate [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It also illustrates the challenges in using trophic categories as a proxy for ecological function. Herbivorous fishes have been implicated in the top-down control of reef benthos, as their grazing of recently dead coral substrate prevents the rapid colonisation of macroalgae. Further, over-fishing of herbivores has been invoked to explain declines in coral cover and they are consequently considered to play a key functional role in maintaining coral reef resilience [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Parrotfishes (Labridae; Scarinae) are a significant component of this herbivorous fish community on account of their size, numerical abundance and hence biomass [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They are also targeted in many reef fisheries and are frequently used as indicators for the condition or resilience of reefs [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, recent work on the intricacies of parrotfish feeding modes and diets [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] indicates that assigning species with similar feeding modes into broad trophic groups may over-simplify their functional role in reef resilience. Further, we show that parrotfish population densities can vary by up to 43-fold between reef sites in the absence of fishing and so caution against assumptions that declines in parrotfish populations are necessarily due to fishing.</p><p>The largest parrotfishes, <italic>Cetoscarus ocellatus</italic> and <italic>Chlororus strongylocephalos</italic>, showed completely opposing patterns in their distribution with <italic>Cetoscarus ocellatus</italic> closely associated with healthy reefs with high coral cover at the northern atolls (Peros Banhos and Salomon). In contrast, <italic>Chlorurus strongylocephalos</italic> was strongly correlated with reefs at GCB which had the lowest live coral and the highest cover of calcareous algae, soft coral and macroalgae. This opposing pattern in the distribution of these two high-biomass parrotfish, functionally termed &#x0201c;excavators&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], can be explained by their feeding behaviour. <italic>Cetoscarus ocellatus</italic> are territorial, non-schooling, harvest small areas of reef and are associated with reefs of high live coral cover (M. Samoilys, pers. obs.). In contrast, <italic>Chlorurus strongylocephalos</italic> prefers disturbed reefs which offer a larger benthic surface area for excavating the dead coral reef matrix [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. They feed on these substrates, typically in large schools if the disturbed substrate is of sufficient area (H. Choat, James Cook University, pers. comm. 2016). The Indian Ocean endemic, <italic>Chlorurus enneacanthus</italic>, was observed to have a similar feeding strategy to <italic>Chlorurus strongylocephalos</italic> (M. Samoilys pers. obs.). These <italic>Chlorurus</italic> species conform to reports from the Philippines where some parrotfish species prefer areas of reef that have become damaged, for example from cyclones [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The patterns seen here suggest bottom-up control of parrotfish populations by coral cover in positive (e.g. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>niger</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>ocellatus</italic>) or negative (e.g. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>strongylocephalos</italic>) relationships. These pathways therefore need to be considered when examining the role of parrotfishes in influencing coral recovery trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The isolated Chagos Archipelago provides a valuable ecological benchmark for understanding the structure of reef fish assemblages when fishing impacts are minimal. Differences in fish assemblages across the archipelago were associated with variation in reef benthic condition, which suggested a bottom-up response of fish populations to changes in coral cover. Our results support the concept that herbivory and detrivory are significant functions provided by reef fishes [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], but we propose that separating diet from the structural impact of these feeding modes will improve our understanding of their functional role in reef resilience. The large variation in parrotfish abundance found in the Chagos Archipelago supports studies (e.g. Russ et al. [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) that caution against assumptions elsewhere that parrotfish population abundances are largely driven by fishing. We found surgeonfish species that graze epilithic algae and parrotfish species that exploit bare substrate to access nutrients within the calcareous matrix [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] are two key taxa responsible for differences in fish assemblages among the atolls. Both may function to keep macroalgal levels down, but the drivers of their populations are different. Parrotfishes have evolved highly successful traits to exploit food sources on reefs and contribute significant biomass on coral reefs [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191448.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], including during declines in coral cover [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and some species are impacted negatively by fishing [<xref rid="pone.0191448.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Clarifying these trophic dynamics is vital to refine functional trait approaches for understanding the impacts of climate change and fishing on coral reef biodiversity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191448.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Fish and benthos survey sites with reef type descriptors at each atoll.</title><p>Two dive surveys for fish were done at each site. * = fish survey sites where no benthic data were collected.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191448.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191448.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Taxa surveyed for abundance and biomass and their trophic group and functional characteristics.</title><p>All taxa were recorded to species level (not all species are listed here).
