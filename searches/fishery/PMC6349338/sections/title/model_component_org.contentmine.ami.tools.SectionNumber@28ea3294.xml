 <div class="title">Model components and interactions in (A) EwE, (B) Gadget and (C) MSPM models of the Baltic Sea ecosystem.</div>
 <p>Grey shaded ovals represent the three fish stocks included in all models. Green ovals denote components unique to a model. Black arrows represent predation, the red arrow competition, and blue arrows abiotic environmental effects. Single-headed arrows represent one-way interactions and double-headed arrows dynamic predator-prey feedbacks. Fitting periods for the models were 2004–2013 (EwE), 1974–2013 (Gadget) and 1982–2013 (MSPM). EwE and MSPM have yearly, while Gadget quarterly time steps.</p>
