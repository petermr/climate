 <div class="title">Visual representations of how the three conceptual trade-offs (as identified by Mouchet 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (23)) may appear across the seven outcomes assessed in our study.
 </div>
 <p>Each example radar plot (A,B,C) shows all five focal outcomes (ecosystem health, migratory species, fishery resources, well-being of user groups (e.g., fishers), and well-being of users of the ecosystem (e.g., coastal residents, tourists), with the inner-most band representing a decline and the outside line representing an increase (indicated with ‘worst’ to ‘best’ on the radar plot). Key outcome trade-offs have been circled to aid understanding of the trade-off typology and how it applies to our data. Outcome abbreviations used in radar plot: Eco = ecosystem health change; WB_Eco = well-being change of the user of the ecosystem health indicator; WB_Fish = well-being change of the user of the fisheries indicator; Mig = migratory species change; Fish = fisheries change. 
  <span class="bold">A</span>: Supply trade-off: ecosystem health improving, but fisheries declining (or vice versa; conservation versus use). 
  <span class="bold">B</span>: Supply-demand trade-off: fisheries improving, but well-being of a user (fisher) declining (or vice versa). 
  <span class="bold">C</span>: Demand trade-off: differentiated impacts in the well-being of different users, with a well-being decline of a user dependent on fisheries, and a well-being improvement of a user dependent on ecosystem health (e.g. tourism) (or vice versa).
