   <span class="italic">CAb</span> follows a normal set up with a uniform lattice of squared cells (80 × 80 km) with rules based on a Moore neighbourhood of range two. Each cell is defined in terms of geographical coordinates and the state variable of the cell is the cod biomass in the water column at the geographical position of the cell. Hence, the spatial distribution of the cod biomass at one point in time is given by the matrix of state variables in the lattice. According to the definition of Moore neighbourhoods (Hogeweg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">1988</a>) the rules are given as the percentwise distribution of the mid cell of a 5 × 5 cells matrix into all the 25 cells (at range = 2). With a time unit of 1 month, the cod distribution is recalculated monthly on basis of the current state variables, month-specific rules and the cell-specific growth properties. Biomass within each cell grows linearly towards the environmental carrying capacity level at which local stock collapse occurs so that only the fractional part of the biomass is left (while standardising the carrying capacity level to one). The natural mortality in the model is mainly covered by these local collapses, depending on monthly variation in carrying capacity levels and biomass levels in each cell after redistribution of biomass and biomass growth.

  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The data sample from the period 2004 to 2010 was considered to represent the current environmental situation, rather than reflecting ongoing changes in climate. There are several reasons for this. The period is rather short and the datasets, although displaying significant variations in the distributional patterns, do not show any significant trends or systematic changes. The seasonal variations are extreme but the seasonal biomass centres of gravity are almost identical each year during the period. In terms of weighted biomass distances for each quarter during the time period from a given geographical point (in the calculations the coordinates of Tromsø was chosen), cluster analyses did not reveal any systematic changes and different years constituted the main cluster for each of the four quarters.</p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on this, the data sample was considered as a representative distribution related to the current climatic conditions. The average monthly spatial distributions of NEA cod stock biomasses during the period 2004–2010 were found by merging the different sources of information relevant for each month as explained in Eide (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2014</a>). Resulting distributional maps for each month are shown in Fig.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial and temporal distributions of the NEA cod environmental carrying capacity levels for each scenario have been estimated on the basis of constraining physical and biological factors in addition to the observed distributional patterns (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The NEA cod distribution as assumed to be constrained to ocean depths less than thousand metres and ocean temperatures higher than −1.5 °C (the monthly average at 50 m depths) (Eide 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2014</a>). In addition, a cell’s environmental carrying capacity is reduced by 80 % when small zooplankton densities fall below 2 g carbon per square metre, considering the density of small zooplankton being a proxy for food availability in the area.
  </p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Monthly estimated current carrying capacities are then modified according to 
   <span class="italic">SinMod</span> datasets of bathymetry, temperatures and zooplankton biomasses over the simulation period, representing the changes in environmental carrying capacities corresponding to the A1B scenario. As stochastic element is added to estimated environmental carrying capacities. As the mean deviation of the carrying capacity of each cell varies between 20 and 30 % (following the seasonal pattern of cod availability) during the period of observations (2004–2010), a normally distributed stochastic element with a mean value of one and a standard deviation of 10 % is assumed. The stochastic element also serves to establish the zero scenario monthly carrying capacities, repeating the current climate with the minor perturbations caused by the stochastic process.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2016</a>). Both the zero and the A1B scenario show ±10 % fluctuations related to the base year (2012), while the A1B scenario (upper panel in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>) in the mid 2030s displays a shift upwards, resulting in almost a 10 % increase in carrying capacity compared with the base year.

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When having established the cellular automata lattice with cell-specific carrying capacities, which develop according to environmental variables and observed distributional pattern in the cod population, the next step is to establish cellular automata distributional rules. Essentially, the rules describe how individual cod moves in terms of directions and distances within the time frame of 1 month. According to Rose et al. (
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">1995</a>), NEA cod may have a range between 210 and 720 km over a period of 30 days, indicating that three cells in all direction from a given cell in a 80 × 80 km grid represent a reasonable range (range = 2, assuming Moore neighbourhood).
  </p>
  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rules should in principle be able to move the cod biomasses over time according to previous observations. This boils down to a straight forward statistical problem minimising the sum of squared distances between the observed centres of gravity in the observed cod biomass and the centres of gravity in the by rule distributed cod biomass (described in detail in Eide 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2016</a>). The best model fit is indicated by the red cells in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, while the observed centres of gravity (based on surveys and catch information) are shown as blue cells in the same figure. The minimised sum of squares of the 12 observations equals 6.62 (measured in square units) within a distribution of monthly centres of gravity spanning over 8 (horizontally) times 2 (vertically) cells (Eide 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2014</a>). This means that the rules perform sufficiently well in replicating observed migratory pattern in the NEA cod stock. The rules are month specific and identical for all cells for each month.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The shifting carrying capacity distributions constitute the model environment and mimic the changes both in the physical and biological environment in which the cod stock lives, defining rich areas allowing the cod stock to expand and poor areas in which saturation levels are reached at low biomass levels. By affecting the distribution of biomasses also the migration pattern is affected, even though the cellular automata distribution rules are fixed for the whole simulation period (Eide 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2014</a>).

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
   <span class="italic">ABe</span> model includes four North-Norwegian fishing ports (Svolvær, Tromsø, Hammerfest and Vardø) and two fleet types (small and large vessels) placed in each of these ports (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The small vessels represent coastal fishing vessels with an assumed monthly range of four cells, while the large vessels may operate in the high sea, having a monthly range of eight cells.

Apart from being operated from four different ports (causing differences in variable costs due to different distances to home ports), each of the two types of vessels (small-scale and high sea vessels) is assumed to be homogeneous in terms of technology and economy. However, the two types of vessels differ from each other in both of these dimensions.

The problem is however to identify where the most profitable cells are positioned. The fishers search to solve this problem through the use of their best knowledge, experience and skills, including the use of fish finding technology, the information that may be obtained within the fishing community and from other sources, attitude towards risk and the economic factors constraining their activity.

A smartness parameter value equal one clearly is far below the expected smartness levels of today’s fisheries, while a smartness value equal 10 appears to be too optimistic with respect of level of insight and fishing aptitude. A qualified guess is that the most realistic smartness value is somewhere in the range of 2–3, depending on individual experience, knowledge, technical measures as well as social factors. In this study, a global smartness value is assumed to be global within each simulation. The model parameter setting is presented in Table

  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study includes different governmental constraints represented by four different management regimes of which one is no management (open access). The other three management regimes are all in principle structured similarly to the current management system, assuming different exploitation rates and perfect management control. A total allowable catch (TAC) is set according to a given target levels of the fishing mortality rate (
   <span class="italic">F</span>), assuming perfect stock information.
  </p>
  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NEA cod stock is equally shared between Norway and Russia, and a Russian catch of the same quantity as the Norwegian catch is included without defining specifically a Russian fleet. The Russian capture is assumed to be high sea catches following the distribution of cod biomasses in areas available for Russian vessels.</p>
  <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total Norwegian quota is shared between coastal (small) vessels and high sea (large) vessel in a fixed ratio (60/40), which is a slight simplification of the current quota allocation system. The high sea vessels are not allowed to fish inside four nautical miles from the baseline, which is implemented by limited access (25 % of total area) to cells along the coast.</p>
  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study investigates and compares distribution and variability in the two scenarios, in particular emphasising fleet diversity and spatial distribution of the fishing activity. While previous studies (Eide 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2007</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2008</a>) suggest that fisheries management may have a greater impact than climate change on the biological development and economic performance of Arctic groundfish fisheries, these studies did however not include spatial distributions of biomasses and fishing effort.
