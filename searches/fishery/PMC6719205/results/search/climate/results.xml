 <result pre="decreased. Thus, the changes in land use influenced the individual" exact="ecosystem services," post="which are shown in Figure 7. Bare land increased"/>
 <result pre="decreased by 30,642 hectares (−0.92%). Consequently, the value of forest" exact="ecosystem services" post="decreased by about US$0.57 billion. The most noticeable decrease"/>
 <result pre="increased correspondingly. The water system is the major contributor of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in all land-use types in Jiangsu Province. The area"/>
 <result pre="main reason for this trend is the change in per-unit" exact="ecosystem services" post="value. The desert appeared mainly as saline-alkali land in"/>
 <result pre="Table A5. For all types of land use and different" exact="ecosystem services" post="in this paper, the absolute value of all sensitivity"/>
 <result pre="close to zero. It means that the value of different" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province is stable to the changes of"/>
 <result pre="in Jiangsu Province is stable to the changes of per-unit" exact="ecosystem services" post="in different land-use types. Among them, only the sensitivity"/>
 <result pre="is negatively provided by paddy, and it means water supply’s" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is inelastic to per-unit ecosystem services of paddy;"/>
 <result pre="means water supply’s ecosystem services value is inelastic to per-unit" exact="ecosystem services" post="of paddy; other sensitivity coefficients of different ecosystem services"/>

 <result pre="analysis of ecosystem services is to analyze the relationship between" exact="ecosystem services" post="from the whole-time span. In order to further study"/>
 <result pre="to further study the degree and direction of interaction between" exact="ecosystem services" post="in different time periods, we introduced the ESTD model"/>
 <result pre="the ESTD model to quantify and evaluate the relationship between" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. From 2005 to 2018, ESTD is"/>
 <result pre="to Table A6, there are 100 groups of synergies among" exact="ecosystem services," post="of which 18 groups are negative, 82 groups are"/>
 <result pre="synergistic. This shows that synergy is the dominant relationship among" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. Among them, synergy mainly exists in"/>
 <result pre="Shandong Province. This brings about changes in the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. In order to reflect the changes"/>
 <result pre="in Jiangsu Province. In order to reflect the changes in" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province, ESTDs from 2005 to 2015 and"/>
 <result pre="can be found that both the degree and direction of" exact="ecosystem services" post="interaction in Jiangsu Province have changed after the operation"/>
 <result pre="2005 to 2015, the proportion of trade-offs and synergies between" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province was consistent with that in 2005–2018."/>
 <result pre="2015 to 2018, the proportion of trade-offs and synergies between" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province changed greatly, compared with that in"/>
 <result pre="compared with that in 2005–2018. From 2015 to 2018, all" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province were synergistic. Among them, the highest"/>
 <result pre="raw material production. According to the degree of interaction of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province, the absolute value of ESTD increases,"/>
 <result pre="while the changes in synergy degree of different types of" exact="ecosystem services" post="are different. In regulation services, the synergy between hydrological"/>
 <result pre="In regulation services, the synergy between hydrological regulation and other" exact="ecosystem services" post="increases; in contrast, in supply services, the trade-off relationship"/>
 <result pre="services, the trade-off relationship between water resources supply and other" exact="ecosystem services" post="has changed into synergy. In addition, the synergy between"/>

 <result pre="ecosystem services are included in the final compensation scope, namely" exact="climate" post="regulation, hydrological regulation, environmental purification, soil conservation and maintaining"/>
 <result pre="the main reasons for the change in the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. Through Section 4.1, we can find"/>
 <result pre="of land, bare land can provide the lowest value of" exact="ecosystem services." post="Therefore, with a large number of land types, such"/>
 <result pre="forests and grasslands transformed into bare land, the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province has declined significantly. Per-unit standard ecosystem"/>
 <result pre="ecosystem services in Jiangsu Province has declined significantly. Per-unit standard" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is another important factor affecting the value of"/>
 <result pre="services value is another important factor affecting the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. The value of ecosystem services is"/>

 <result pre="value of ecosystem services is obtained by multiplying the per-unit" exact="ecosystem services" post="value and land area. The per-unit ecosystem services value"/>
 <result pre="the per-unit ecosystem services value and land area. The per-unit" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is calculated on the basis of the market"/>
 <result pre="crops is subject to the economic environment, the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="is indirectly affected by it. According to Section 4.2.1,"/>
 <result pre="it. According to Section 4.2.1, we can find that the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value of Jiangsu Province reached the highest value in"/>
 <result pre="change of net profit will directly affect the per-unit standard" exact="ecosystem services" post="value. Therefore, the final per-unit standard ecosystem services value"/>
 <result pre="per-unit standard ecosystem services value. Therefore, the final per-unit standard" exact="ecosystem services" post="value in four years were US$340.03, US$586.53, US$227.52 and"/>
 <result pre="increases year by year; after all, seed cost, fertilizer cost," exact="agricultural" post="machinery use cost and labor cost are increasing year"/>
 <result pre="of food crops has changed dramatically, and the per-unit standard" exact="ecosystem services" post="value has also changed constantly. The purpose of accounting"/>
 <result pre="services value has also changed constantly. The purpose of accounting" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is to monetize ecosystem services, and then calculate"/>
 <result pre="The purpose of accounting ecosystem services value is to monetize" exact="ecosystem services," post="and then calculate the economic value of ecosystem services,"/>
 <result pre="monetize ecosystem services, and then calculate the economic value of" exact="ecosystem services," post="so that we can understand the evolution of the"/>
 <result pre="environment. However, the above analysis shows that the accounting of" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is not only affected by land-use area, but"/>
 <result pre="the ESTD model is used to study the relationship between" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. The three periods are 2005–2018, 2005–2015"/>
 <result pre="18 groups are trade-offs. Synergies are the dominant relationship among" exact="ecosystem services" post="in Jiangsu Province. These 18 trade-offs are all caused"/>

 <result pre="are synergistic. Human factors have become the main cause of" exact="ecosystem services" post="change in Jiangsu Province. On 12 December 2014, the"/>
 <result pre="in Jiangsu Province are reduced, which weakens the role of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in other parts, such as gas regulation, postponement regulation,"/>
 <result pre="research on watershed ecological compensation standards, when they use the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value method to determine watershed ecological compensation standards, they"/>
 <result pre="to determine watershed ecological compensation standards, they basically regard the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value in one year in the research area as"/>
 <result pre="should compensate for the improvement in the environmental effect. If" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is regarded by scholars as the final compensation"/>
 <result pre="that watershed ecological compensation standards should be the change of" exact="ecosystem services" post="value in different years, rather than the value of"/>
 <result pre="services value in different years, rather than the value of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in one year. Secondly, if the ecosystem services value"/>
 <result pre="value of ecosystem services in one year. Secondly, if the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value is taken as the final compensation standard, it"/>
 <result pre="the implementation of the watershed ecological compensation system. Therefore, the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value in one year cannot be directly used as"/>
 <result pre="ecological compensation standards. At the same time, the change of" exact="ecosystem services" post="value in different years can reflect Jiangsu Province’s efforts"/>
 <result pre="efforts in protecting the water environment. Taking the change of" exact="ecosystem services" post="value as the basis of determining the watershed ecological"/>
 <result pre="allocation in China: Regions with an obvious increase in the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value receive little or no compensation, while regions with"/>
 <result pre="or no compensation, while regions with less increase in the" exact="ecosystem services" post="value receive more compensation funds. Therefore, according to the"/>
 <result pre="and yielded positive results. Thus, from 2015 to 2018, Yangzhou’s" exact="ecosystem services" post="stabilized at a better level, without significant improvements being"/>
 <result pre="diversion projects. Since the projects contributed to the improvement of" exact="ecosystem services" post="in these cities, the final allocation of watershed ecological"/>
 <result pre="following limitations: (1) It only considers the supply value of" exact="ecosystem services," post="but does not consider its demand value. According to"/>
