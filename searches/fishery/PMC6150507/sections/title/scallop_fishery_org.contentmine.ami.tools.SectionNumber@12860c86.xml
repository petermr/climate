 <div class="title">Scallop fishery landings from RCP8.5 (top panel) and RCP4.5 (bottom panel) under the highest ocean acidification impacts (increased larval mortality, reduced growth rates, and increased mortality due to predation) with management strategies: No set catch limit, maximum allowable biological catch (ABC), varying fisheries reference points (ABC+F
  <sub>MSY</sub>), and area closures (ABC+F
  <sub>MSY</sub>+10% closure).

 <p>The purple line/band illustrates the same dataset as in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203536.g004" href="#pone.0203536.g004">Fig 4</a>. Bold line illustrates the mean, and shaded area is the 95% confidence interval for 100 model runs with stochastic recruitment. The 2000–2012 period is hindcast with observed recruitment.
