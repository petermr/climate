</p></notes></front><body><p>Predicting the flowering time of angiosperm taxa under projected climate conditions or in locations at which flowering has not been observed is essential to the prediction of a wide array of ecological processes, including risk of frost damage to floral tissues (Cannell and Smith, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>; Inouye, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), nectar and pollen availability to pollinators (Aldridge et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), and the intensity of competition for pollinators among co&#x02010;flowering taxa (Waser, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1978</xref>; Rathcke, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1988a</xref>, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">b</xref>; Feldman et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Phenological prediction can also be important to local tourism, and for determining the optimum time for herbicide or pesticide treatment. For example, accurate predictions of flowering time can prevent the planned application of pesticides during flowering, when beneficial insects and birds are visiting flowers. Similarly, the planned use of herbicides to suppress invasive plant species should occur before or during flowering, so as to minimize seed production. Consequently, the ability to predict the flowering times of angiosperm species is relevant not only to ecologists and other researchers, but also to land managers and other professionals across a wide array of disciplines. In recent years, some tools have emerged to predict phenological timing under various climate conditions, such as the phenological forecast maps produced by Phenology Forecasts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phenology.naturecast.org/">https://phenology.naturecast.org/</ext-link>) or univariate phenological models produced by the USA National Phenology Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.usanpn.org/data/visualizations">https://www.usanpn.org/data/visualizations</ext-link>). To date, however, species&#x02010;specific phenological models have been developed for only a small number of species, and such models have often required daily growing degree&#x02010;day or chilling degree&#x02010;day information, which until recently have not been readily available across the vast majority of locations, and have required significant technical expertise to utilize effectively. Furthermore, the output of such models is rarely bundled in such a way as to facilitate phenological predictions in the absence of extensive calculations or data manipulations on the part of the user.</p><p>In this paper, we present PhenoForecaster, a software package that allows users to predict quickly and easily the mean flowering date for each of 2320 angiosperm species. PhenoForecaster uses readily accessible climate data in combination with species&#x02010;specific phenological models that were generated by the authors using a simplified version of a method previously used to evaluate phenological responses to climate using digital herbarium records (Park and Mazer, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Specifically, PhenoForecaster uses estimates of five climate parameters (i.e., the quantity of winter and spring precipitation that fell as snow in a given year [PAS_wt and PAS_sp, respectively], the number of frost&#x02010;free days that occurred in a given winter and spring [NFFD_wt and NFFD_sp, respectively], and the date of the beginning of the frost&#x02010;free period [BFFP expressed as the Day of Year]) to predict the day of year (DOY) on which the selected angiosperm species will reach its mean flowering date (MFD) at a location experiencing those conditions. These parameters represent the climate cues to which MFD was found to be most sensitive across the majority of these species using similar data and modeling techniques to those used by PhenoForecaster (Park and Mazer, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In order to facilitate PhenoForecaster's use, all of the phenoclimate models that it uses were limited to these climate parameters, which were sufficient to retain the majority of the predictive power produced by more complicated models (Park and Mazer, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). This package allows both manual entry of climate parameters as well as bulk entry of data in cases where phenological predictions are required across multiple locations or climate scenarios. PhenoForecaster has been designed to accept climate input in a comma&#x02010;separated value (CSV) format that is compatible with climate data generated by ClimateNA (Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), a freely available software package that produces spatially explicit estimates of historical climate conditions throughout North America, and which utilizes a user&#x02010;friendly graphical interface and requires only that the user provide the latitude and longitude (either manually or as a CSV file) of all points of interest.</p><p>Thus, while predictions of phenological timing for a given plant species previously required extensive observation, modeling, and calculation, PhenoForecaster represents a simple&#x02010;to&#x02010;use tool through which the phenology of many angiosperm species can be readily predicted under any observed or theoretical climate scenario.</p><sec id="aps31230-sec-0005"><title>METHODS AND RESULTS</title><p>PhenoForecaster is an open source program written in Python 2.7 (Python Core Team, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The source code, as well as the code used to construct the phenoclimate models used by PhenoForecaster, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/isaacWpark/PhenoForecaster">https://github.com/isaacWpark/PhenoForecaster</ext-link>. A Windows installer package and source code, as well as a user's manual, are also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/mazer/susan/software">https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/mazer/susan/software</ext-link>. To install the package, the user simply needs to download and run the installer. The executable has been successfully tested on Windows 7, 8, and 10. PhenoForecaster has an intuitive graphical user interface that allows users with minimal prior experience with phenological prediction or with PhenoForecaster to predict the phenological timing of any targeted species by implementing the following steps.</p><p>First, the user must select the subset of species&#x02010;specific models from which they wish to choose, based on the minimum model reliability they desire. By default, only the 490 species&#x02010;specific models for which expected mean absolute error (MAE) &#x02264;15 days (indicating that phenological predictions are, on average, typically within 15 days of observed MFDs) were considered to be &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; model fits, and are therefore displayed for selection. Depending on user preference, however, this list of species may be expanded to include species&#x02010;specific models that exhibit higher MAE, or contracted to only display those species for which more accurate phenological models are available (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="aps31230-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Having filtered the species by the minimum MAE desired, the user must then use the species selection dropdown menu to select the species for which phenological predictions are to be generated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="aps31230-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Second, the specific climatic conditions for which phenological predictions are desired may then be entered manually (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="aps31230-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C) or uploaded as a CSV data file (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="aps31230-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). For the latter, the first line of the input file is a header line with column descriptions. The first two columns of the file, labeled &#x02018;ID1&#x02019; and &#x02018;ID2&#x02019;, represent any string data the user desires to include for the purpose of identifying each row of data in a unique fashion. The remaining columns may be in any order, but must include the following: &#x02018;NFFD_wt&#x02019;, &#x02018;NFFD_sp&#x02019;, &#x02018;PAS_wt&#x02019;, &#x02018;PAS_sp&#x02019;, and &#x02018;BFFP&#x02019;. Data in the column &#x02018;NFFD_wt&#x02019; should consist of a count of the number of frost&#x02010;free days from January 1 to March 31 in the year for which flowering time is to be estimated. Data in the column &#x02018;NFFD_sp&#x02019; should consist of a count of the number of frost&#x02010;free days from April 1 to June 30 in the year for which flowering time is to be estimated. Data in the column &#x02018;PAS_wt&#x02019; should consist of the total precipitation that fell as snow (in mm) from January 1 to March 31 in the year for which flowering time is to be estimated. Data in the column &#x02018;PAS_sp&#x02019; should consist of the total precipitation that fell as snow (in mm) from April 1 to June 30 in the year for which flowering time is to be estimated. Data in the column &#x02018;BFFP&#x02019; should consist of the DOY on which the annual frost&#x02010;free period began. PhenoForecaster allows any number of additional data columns (representing other data that may be associated with each location or year to be predicted) to be placed into the input file. In cases where the user desires that data from such additional columns be preserved in the output file created by PhenoForecaster, they may select the &#x02018;retain all input data&#x02019; option in the lower left of the user interface. If this option is selected, PhenoForecaster will preserve all columns from the input data, appending a new column with the header &#x02018;DOY_Predicted&#x02019; that consists of the predicted MFD for a given row of data, and output all data as a CSV file. Otherwise, PhenoForecaster will generate output in the form of a CSV file, with the headers &#x02018;ID1&#x02019;, &#x02018;ID2&#x02019;, and &#x02018;DOY_Predicted.&#x02019;</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="aps31230-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>User interface for PhenoForecaster.

Specimens that did not include either the decimal latitude and longitude from which the sample was collected or the precise date of collection were eliminated. Specimens that were not explicitly recorded as being in flower within either the Darwin Core fields &#x02018;reproductivecondition&#x02019; or &#x02018;lifestage&#x02019; were eliminated. Specimens that were only listed as &#x02018;in bud&#x02019; or &#x02018;fruiting&#x02019; were not considered to be in flower for purposes of this analysis. Duplicate specimens (i.e., specimens of a given species that were collected on the same date and from the same location) were also excluded from analysis. Each remaining specimen therefore represented a single phenological observation. Phenological models derived using herbarium&#x02010;based observations of flowering phenology have been found to accurately predict shifts in phenological events that were observed in situ in response to climate changes (Primack et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Miller&#x02010;Rushing et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Park and Mazer, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).</p><p>Species&#x02010;specific models of MFD for each species were conducted using elastic net regularization, which has previously been demonstrated to be an effective method for predicting the flowering times of angiosperm taxa using herbarium specimens (Park and Mazer, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). For the models used by PhenoForecaster, winter and spring climate conditions (consisting of NFFD, PAS, and BFFP) at the location and DOY from which each specimen was collected were first estimated using the software package ClimateNA (Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Each species&#x02010;specific phenoclimate model was then constructed using elastic net regularization, a multivariate regression method that, rather than selecting or removing parameters in a binary fashion as with forward or backward selection, enforces parsimony by penalizing model complexity using two penalty terms: the sum of the absolute value of all parameter coefficients (L1, Eq. 1a), and the sum of all parameter coefficients squared (L2, Eq. 1b [Zou and Hastie, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; De Mol et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>]).<disp-formula id="aps31230-disp-0001"><label>(1a)</label><mml:math id="nlm-math-1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>L1</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">&#x02016;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">&#x02016;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>

</p><p>A penalty weighting term (&#x003b1;) controls the degree to which model complexity is penalized. Similarly, the relative penalization of L1 versus L2 is controlled by a relative weighting term (&#x003c1;).

</p><p>This method has substantial advantages over stepwise forward selection or backward elimination regression techniques, particularly when handling data sets in which multiple explanatory factors are likely to exhibit some degree of collinearity, such as is common in climatic data (Rawal et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Elastic net regression has been found to generate models that remain highly stable in cases where multiple explanatory factors exhibit collinearity (Zou and Hastie, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), while avoiding the variance inflation that often occurs when using stepwise regression techniques (De Mol et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Raschkla and Mirjalili, <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).</p><p>For each angiosperm species that was represented by 100 or more specimens in our herbarium&#x02010;based data set, phenological models were constructed to predict the MFD of that species from local climate conditions using the elasticCV class contained within Scikit&#x02010;Learn 0.814&#x02010;4 in Python, which conducts an internally cross&#x02010;validated version of elastic net regularization that selects the optimal values for the weighting terms &#x003c1; and &#x003b1; in order to minimize both model complexity and standard error (Appendix <xref rid="aps31230-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).</p><p>The models used for each species in this study were constructed through iterative fitting along a regularization path, using 100 values of &#x003b1; and 22 values of &#x003c1; (ranging from 0.01 to 0.99). The optimal model coefficients were then selected using 25&#x02010;fold cross&#x02010;validation. The MAE for each model represents the mean MAE of the 25 iterations in which it was trained and tested using separate data sets; this value therefore represents the expected degree of error (in days) that may be expected for phenological predictions of a given species under novel conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="aps31230-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additionally, the accuracy of these species&#x02010;specific models was tested for three species using observations of mean flowering time derived from in situ phenological observations provided by the USA National Phenology Network database. The models used by PhenoForecaster predicted the timing of both in situ and herbarium&#x02010;based observations of mean flowering with similar accuracy (as measured by MAE, Appendix <xref rid="aps31230-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Species for which phenoclimate models produced MAE values of &#x0003c;15 days were considered to exhibit &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; model fits (and therefore available for selection in PhenoForecaster) by default. However, PhenoForecaster allows users to alter the MAE threshold that they consider to represent &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; model performance to accommodate cases where higher or lower predictive accuracy is required. For 186 of the 2320 species examined here, the cross&#x02010;validated MAE produced by the phenological model was identical to that estimated using the collection dates of the specimens alone (i.e., without selecting climate parameters). Although these species were retained for use in PhenoForecaster, it should be noted that no climate data may be entered for these species, and the resulting predictions of flowering time consist only of a constant value reflecting an estimate of the mean observed flowering date for that species, which is not influenced by local climate conditions. Additional species will be added and models will be updated as new data or superior modeling techniques become available.

PhenoForecaster provides a free, quick, and easy&#x02010;to&#x02010;use software package that allows researchers of any background to quickly predict the mean flowering date of angiosperm species under novel annual conditions, or at locations where the phenology of that species has not previously been observed. Its intuitive user interface and compatibility with existing spatial climate estimation packages such as ClimateNA (Wang et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="aps31230-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) make phenological prediction easy to accomplish by researchers of any background without the need for extensive training or familiarity with phenoclimate modeling. It should be noted, however, that the accuracy of predictions by PhenoForecaster is variable and depends highly on the species selected for prediction. The expected accuracy of PhenoForecaster output, as reflected by the MAE value for that species, should be kept in mind when dealing with predicted MFD values generated by PhenoForecaster. Furthermore, these models do not account for potential heterogeneity of phenological responsiveness among populations of a given species, but instead represent mean phenological responsiveness across all available specimens for each species. These data were also based on models trained using phenological observations throughout North America only, and using derived estimates of local climate condition produced using ClimateNA; these estimates may exhibit some differences from ground&#x02010;based observations of these climate parameters, or from estimates of these climate parameters derived using different methods. Thus, predictions of the phenology of these species outside of North America, or based on different sources of climate data, should be treated with caution. In addition, it should be remembered that PhenoForecaster models the timing of MFD only, and that the relationship of MFD to other phenophases, such as leaf&#x02010;out, date of first flower, or date of last flower, may be highly variable among species and across climate gradients. These predictions should therefore be treated as dates on which the individuals of a given species are likely to be in flower where they have experienced a particular suite of climatic conditions, rather than as the onset or termination date of any specific phenophase. Where possible, we also recommend cross&#x02010;checking predicted MFD values generated by PhenoForecaster against observed MFD values for that species, particularly when evaluating the phenology of a species under conditions that are outside of its historical range limits. Nevertheless, PhenoForecaster represents a freely available and powerful tool that allows any researcher to conduct rapid predictions of phenological timing under past, projected, or otherwise novel climate conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="aps31230-sup-0001"><caption><p>
