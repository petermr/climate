To investigate how warming may affect native and invasive species separately and together (intraspecific and interspecific competition, respectively) and whether any warming impact is resource dependent, we examined the performance of two competing herbivores (native <italic>Pieris canidia</italic> and invasive <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>) on two common host plants under three temperature settings (control, 3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warming using environmental chambers). The results revealed that warming benefited the development and growth of both <italic>Pieris</italic> under intraspecific competition, but the benefits were host-plant dependent. Notably, the native or invasive <italic>Pieris</italic> gained an advantage from interspecific competition (host-plant dependent), but warming neutralized the competitive advantages of either <italic>Pieris</italic> species. These findings raise the possibility that warming-induced shifts in competitive status may become a crucial mechanism shaping ecosystems worldwide, because most ecosystems are challenged by species invasion and warming. Moreover, this study revealed a discrepancy in species thermal&#x000a0;performance between intra- and interspecific competition. Therefore, to predict native-invasive species competition under warming, current thermal performance applications should use species performance curves derived from interspecific rather than intraspecific competition studies (although the latter is more readily available).</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105-2621-B-002-001</award-id><award-id>106-2313-B-002-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Chuan-Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University (NTU)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Chuan-Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Species invasion, a worldwide phenomenon, can threaten or alter biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functions in invaded habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. One of the underlying mechanisms for invasive species&#x02019; establishment and impact involves competition between invasive and native species, which has been highlighted in several leading hypotheses in invasion ecology. For example, invasive species can outcompete native species by releasing novel chemical weapons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, evolving to a level of competitive superiority<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, possessing a superior adaptation ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, or carrying an advantageous life history traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Although studies have explicitly demonstrated how interspecific competition leads to the establishment of invasive species, how this outcome might shift under subsequent environmental changes is unclear. For example, will climate warming (e.g., a higher average temperature or a hotter summer) increase or decrease the competitive advantage of invasive species against native ones? More worryingly, will invasive species in invaded habitats become more invasive under warming? While previous studies have investigated the interplay between climate warming and species invasion, the aforementioned questions remain to be answered. For example, studies have suggested that warming may benefit invasive species by lifting the thermal constraints of their new habitats (e.g., higher latitude)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although such studies are invaluable in predicting how warming may facilitate the colonization of new habitats by invasive species, they have offered few hints regarding how warming may affect the current competition between invasive and native species in already invaded habitats.</p><p id="Par4">Other studies based on species&#x02019; performance over temperature gradients (i.e., thermal performance) have suggested that warming may benefit invasive species because their thermal tolerance is higher than that of native species (e.g., the &#x0201c;tolerant invaders hypothesis&#x0201d;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Supplement&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, the use of this thermal performance concept (the tolerant invaders hypothesis) to predict species competition outcomes relies on the following assumptions that remain to be tested. (a) This thermal performance concept assumes that native species suffer more (or benefit less) than do invasive ones from warming. However, this assumption does not account for cases where native species can benefit from modest warming as much as invasive ones (e.g., through faster growth and development). These cases may be common; meta-analysis results have indicated that native and non-native species generally respond to warming to a similar degree, although non-native aquatic species may respond more positively to warming than native aquatic ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. (b) The thermal performance concept does not address the effects of resources on the competitive outcomes of native vs. invasive species. It is unclear whether we can assume the same competitive outcome across resource types (e.g., invasive herbivores uniformly outcompete native ones on different host plant species under warming). To advance the application of the thermal performance concept, we should verify whether the competitive outcome is resource (e.g., host plant) dependent, and whether the degree of this resource dependency is mediated by temperature (warming). (c) The thermal performance concept predicts the consequences of warming on interspecific competition based on the thermal performance curves of native and invasive species (Supplement&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Although not explicitly defined, these curves are most likely derived from experiments <italic>without</italic> interspecific competition settings, because almost all thermal performance data (curves) to date have been generated by studies with intraspecific- or no-competition settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Considering data availability, we need to determine whether we can use thermal performance curves from intraspecific- or no-competition studies (readily available) to predict interspecific competition outcomes under warming (e.g., species composition change) (Supplement&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This prediction is valid, for example, if the thermal performance curves from intraspecific competition are equal to those from interspecific competition.</p><p id="Par5">Whereas previous studies have proposed that warming may favor invasive species in a native-invasive species competition, we posited that the competition outcome depends on at least three factors. (1) &#x0201c;Hotter is faster&#x0201d;: Individual organisms commonly grow faster under modest warming conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, competing native and invasive species will likely both undergo growth acceleration under warming. (2) Degree of growth acceleration: If the growth acceleration under warming is symmetric between native and invasive species (i.e., the species exhibit the same degree of growth acceleration under warming), warming may not change the original competition outcome (e.g., invasive species maintain similar competitive advantages under both control and warming conditions). However, if growth acceleration under warming is asymmetric between the species, then warming will likely alter the original competition outcomes. For example, warming may reinforce, neutralize, or reverse the current superiority of invasive species over native species. (3) Resource dependence: When native and invasive species compete for the same resources, one species may develop more effective adaptations to certain resources than the other species, leading to resource-dependent competition outcomes. To predict warming impact on native-invasive species competition, we should clarify whether the impact is resource-dependent.</p><p id="Par6">To improve our understanding of warming impact on native-invasive species interactions, as well as examining the aforementioned thermal performance concept, we investigated (1) how warming may affect the performance of native or invasive herbivores alone (intraspecific competition) and their current interactions (interspecific competition); (2) whether this warming impact, if it exists, is resource (host plant) dependent; and (3) whether the application of the current thermal performance concept can predict the interspecific competition outcomes of native vs. invasive species through species performance curves derived from intraspecific competition across temperature gradients. Specifically, we experimentally examined the temperature effect (control, +3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, +6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) on two competing butterfly species in Taiwan (the native <italic>Pieris canidia</italic> and the invasive <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>) on two of their major host plants - variableleaf yellowcress (<italic>Rorippa indica</italic>) and cabbage (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. <italic>capitata</italic>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Temperature was manipulated using environmental chambers. The control temperature (18.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) reflected the average monthly temperature of <italic>Pieris</italic> peak season (details in Methods). The warming conditions (+3 or +6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) were comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction for the year 2100<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia and P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic> were among the most common local butterflies, with <italic>R</italic>. <italic>indica</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>oleracea</italic> as their major host plants in natural and agricultural systems, respectively.

Although previous studies have demonstrated the effects of this new norm on biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functions, further studies are required to understand how these effects may shift under environmental changes (e.g., a hotter summer or warmer average temperature). This study examined the warming impact on current competition of native and invasive herbivores (two <italic>Pieris</italic> butterfly species) on two host plant species and obtained the following main findings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1)</xref>. (1) Intraspecifically, warming accelerated <italic>Pieris</italic> development (larval period), but the warming impact on <italic>Pieris</italic> growth (body weight and size) was host plant dependent.

In other words, warming did not necessarily benefit invasive species as predicted by the current thermal performance concept (the tolerant invaders hypothesis).

Therefore, to more accurately predict native-invasive species interactions and the outcomes under warming (e.g., species composition change), the application of the current thermal performance concept may need to use species performance curves derived from interspecific rather than intraspecific competition studies (although the latter can be readily available). Based on the aforementioned main findings, we discuss below why warming can be good or bad news for native species, how warming could neutralize the current advantage of native or invasive species, why the warming impact on herbivore growth is host plant dependent, and how to improve the application of the thermal performance concept to more accurately predict native-invasive species competition.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Warming impact on native-invasive species competition</title><p id="Par12">Whether invasive species in invaded habitats will become more invasive against native species under warming is a major concern for ecologists and conservation practitioners.

When neither the invasive nor native <italic>Pieris</italic> gained an advantage from interspecific competition, warming by 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C did not change the pattern. In summary, warming seemed to homogenize the performance of the native and invasive species in this study. If this proves to be a common pattern, modest warming (e.g., by 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) can be expected to bring good and bad news for invaded habitats. The good news is that in habitats where invasive species currently dominate, native species populations may have a chance to bounce back under modest warming. The bad news is that in habitats where native species currently dominate, exotic species may become a greater threat under modest warming.</p><p id="Par13">How did warming neutralize the advantage for the invasive and native <italic>Pieris</italic> in an interspecific competition? This neutralization may be a result of &#x0201c;hotter is faster&#x0201d; and the asymmetric growth acceleration of each species under warming. First, the concept of &#x0201c;hotter is faster&#x0201d; is a common pattern in ectotherms &#x02013; individuals grow faster under modest warming conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Faster growth can lead to advantages in resource competition, such as in cases of asymmetric competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In our study, warming induced faster growth in both <italic>Pieris</italic> (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">a,b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and possibly made both <italic>Pieris</italic> equally effective at competing for food resources. Consequently, this warming effect may outweigh and mask the difference in competitive ability between the two <italic>Pieris</italic> that was originally revealed at the control temperature. Second, asymmetric growth acceleration between the two <italic>Pieris</italic> may lead to warming-induced neutralization (e.g., higher growth acceleration in the less competitive species under warming). A supporting example came from the <italic>Rorippa</italic> plant system, where <italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic>, but not <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>, gained an advantage from interspecific competition at the control temperature (red highlight in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). However, 6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warming accelerated the growth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic> by 79% (RGR 0.302 vs. 0.540) but that of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic> by 102% (RGR 0.262 vs. 0.530). The higher growth acceleration in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic> over <italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic> under warming (permutation test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033) may have been enough to offset the original competitive advantage of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic> (at control temperature), leading to the observed neutralization in interspecific competition.</p><p id="Par14">A further question is why the invasive and native <italic>Pieris</italic> gained an advantage (host plant dependent) in an interspecific competition. Although this study was not designed to examine the underlying mechanisms, we speculate that one species may adapt slightly better to a host plant than the other species, such as an ability to precisely locate more nutritious plant tissue on a single leaf or plant. Therefore, this species could gain an advantage under interspecific competition. We did not observe noticeable food partitioning between the two species or behavioral changes when the two species were put together. Therefore, food partitioning and behavioral shifts are probably not strong candidates for the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Warming impact is host plant dependent</title><p id="Par15">The warming impact on <italic>Pieris</italic> growth (body weight and size) was host plant dependent regardless of competition type, which highlights the need to consider the host plant (resource) effect in predicting the competition results of native vs. invasive herbivores under climate change. For example, warming generally increased <italic>Pieris</italic> growth performance on <italic>Rorippa</italic> plants but not on <italic>Brassica</italic> plants under intra- and interspecific competition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> vs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,e</xref> vs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> vs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>; Supplement&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Why was warming impact on <italic>Pieris</italic> competition host plant dependent? Although this question is outside the scope of this study, we suspect that the dependence is partially due to a different response of plant quality to warming. For example, warming increased leaf N content in <italic>Rorippa</italic> plants (1.70&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.11%, 2.36&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17%, and 3.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.17% for control, +3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and&#x02009;+&#x02009;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively [mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE]; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) but not in <italic>Brassica</italic> plants (5.46&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08%, 5.38&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15%, and 5.50&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06% for control, +3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and +6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, respectively [mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE]; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77). Considering that higher plant N content usually indicates higher food quality for herbivores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is reasonable that we observed a better <italic>Pieris</italic> growth under warming on <italic>Rorippa</italic> (increasing N%) but not <italic>Brassica</italic> plants (no change in N%). Because <italic>Rorippa</italic> and <italic>Brassica</italic> are major host plants for <italic>Pieris</italic> in natural and agricultural systems, respectively, our results call for research to investigate whether the warming impact on native and invasive herbivores commonly differs between natural and agricultural systems &#x02013; for example, because of systematic differences in plant N% and plant response to warming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Improving thermal performance application to predict native-invasive species competition</title><p id="Par16">We suggest that the application of the thermal performance concept should use species performance curves derived from interspecific competition to more accurately predict the competition outcome between native and invasive species populations in invaded habitats. Ecologists and conservation practitioners increasingly apply the thermal performance concept to predict such outcomes under climate change (e.g., species composition change). Although not specified, these predictions are most likely based on species thermal performance derived from intraspecific- or no-competition, rather than interspecific-competition, settings because of data availability. However, our study highlights the risk of this practice, because a native or invasive species could perform more favorably under interspecific rather than intraspecific competition (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic> on <italic>Rorippa</italic> at 18.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>; <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic> on <italic>Brassica</italic> at 18.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 21.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In other words, a prediction based on intraspecific competition results may underestimate the performance of native or invasive species under real interspecific competition.</p><p id="Par17">While our study highlights an existing discrepancy between species performance under intra- and interspecific competition, this discrepancy can be temperature dependent &#x02013; it may decrease or disappear under warming (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). Does this mean that the performance of native and invasive species will converge under climate warming? Does this also mean that the abiotic factor (temperature) will overpower biotic factors (e.g., interspecific competition and host plant quality) under warming? Future studies of different systems could verify the generalizability of our results and help advance climate change ecology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par18">As natural and agricultural systems increasingly face double jeopardy, namely species invasion and climate warming, this study demonstrated how competition between native and invasive species may proceed under climate warming (with potential caveats in Supplement&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The major findings suggest the following points. (1) Intraspecifically, modest warming (3&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) could benefit the development and growth of native or invasive species, potentially in a resource-dependent manner. (2) Warming did not necessarily benefit invasive species as predicted by the current thermal performance concept (the tolerant invaders hypothesis). Instead, native or invasive species may gain an advantage from interspecific competition (resource dependent), and modest warming (3&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) can neutralize the competitive advantages of either species. This warming-induced shift in competitive status may serve as a vital mechanism shaping natural or agricultural systems worldwide, because most ecosystems already contain invasive species and face climate warming. (3) To more accurately predict the competitive outcomes of native vs. invasive species under climate warming (e.g., species composition change), the application of the thermal performance concept should use species performance curves derived from interspecific rather than intraspecific competition studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Species</title><sec id="Sec13"><title><italic>Pieris canidia</italic> and <italic>P. rapae</italic> butterflies</title><p id="Par19"><italic>P</italic>. <italic>canidia</italic> lives in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>, originally from Eurasia, has been introduced to North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.
