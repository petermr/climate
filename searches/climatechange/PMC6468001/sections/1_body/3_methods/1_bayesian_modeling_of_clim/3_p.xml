 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and percentage change in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> between adjacent windows. This gives a total of five pairs of historical and future adjacent windows within 1960–2099. In each pair of adjacent windows, the historical window corresponds to the current time period in the SDP and the future window corresponds to the next 20-year period; this is necessary for the 1-stage transition probabilities needed in the SDP. The 20-year time interval was chosen so that interannual variability was not driving the trend in precipitation and temperature across time periods. The previous Bayesian model

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> denotes the time period and 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> denotes an index between 1 and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>, the possible virtual observations. Virtual temperature change observations range from 0 to 1.5 °C using discrete steps of 0.05 °C (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 31). Virtual observations of percentage change in precipitation range from −30% to 30% using discrete steps of 2% (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 30). These were chosen in order to be comprehensive of all potential future climate states. Therefore, they must be, first, granular enough that adjacent observations result in similar distributions and therefore approximate a continuous set of observations and, second, span a range that exceeds the full range of change predicted by models (i.e. a range of 0–1.5 °C per 20-years is equivalent to 0–7.5 °C of change after 100 years; the CMIP5 ensemble projections a temperature change in the range of 2–4 °C by 2100, fitting well within the range resulting from the virtual observations).
