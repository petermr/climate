<p id="Par40" class="p">Climate impacts on river runoff depend on changes in month-to-month variability in precipitation and temperature in addition to changes in the mean. We model these two changes separately. To develop monthly time-series of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>, we follow the 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>-nearest neighbors (kNN) approach as described in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup> applied to GCM projections. This non-parametric statistical approach allows us to impose the mean 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> from the SDP while also capturing the standard deviation in monthly values and month-to-month autocorrelation projected by the GCMs. This approach was chosen for its simplicity, ease of implementation, and application in long-term water supply; future studies could use other non-parametric approaches such as the local polynomial regression method developed in ref.

 </sup>. For each 20-year time period, we employ the kNN approach to generate 100 samples of 20-year long monthly time-series of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. The resulting time series are then applied to the rainfall-runoff model presented below.
