<p id="Par35" class="p">Stochastic dynamic programming is an optimization approach and control method that represents decision-making under uncertainty using multiple stages or time periods. The result is optimal policies, representing the best possible action as a function of the system state and time period. In our non-stationary formulation, it can also be understood as a form of closed-loop stochastic control, in which new information about the system feeds back into updated estimates for system state transitions over time. This is analogous to existing approaches in ecology, which have defined SDP transition probabilities with probability density functions that include the current system state as an input
