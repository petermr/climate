<p class="p">What then is Day Zero, one may continue to ask? Day Zero is not a static date as it is determined by a number of functional elements (Fourie 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), including rainfall, temperatures and wind speed that impact evaporation rates, the availability of new supply volumes and their timing and, lastly, the consumption rate that the provincial and national governments indicated should be less than 450 megalitres (ML) a day. Day Zero was then defined ‘as the point at which the dam levels fell to 13.5%, therefore requiring all taps in the city to be shut off’ (Arcanjo 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>:2–3). Given the above discussion, Day Zero projections for Cape Town kept on migrating from 12 April through the month to 09 July, and ultimately getting lifted with an announcement on 07 March 2018 (Isaacs 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>).
