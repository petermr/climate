 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>) patterns of risk are largely driven by the safety margin (tolerance) of vegetation to climate change. By contrast, only 2% of the continent is at risk from reductions in MAP by 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). Precipitation vulnerability is isolated to the southwest of Western Australia in places where both the safety margin for drier conditions in the typical species is low (low tolerance) and substantial reductions in MAP are projected (high exposure). Across the five GCMs analysed, MAP is projected to decrease by between 25–276 mm by 2070 in this region.
