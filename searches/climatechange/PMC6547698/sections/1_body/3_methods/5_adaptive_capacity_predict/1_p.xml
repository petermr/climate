<p id="Par45" class="p">We quantified the adaptive capacity of vegetation at each location by aggregating climate breadths calculated for each species. We assumed that a wider median climate breadth across all species at a location indicates a greater adaptive capacity to changing climate for the typical species in the vegetation
