  <title class="title">The spatial distributions of the species affected by the eight most important factors driving climate change vulnerability of threatened species in Australia.</title>
  <p class="p">The shading darkens as the proportion of species occurring in the bioregion is affected by each factor; a) reliance on particular abiotic features or derivatives for habitat, b) reliance on other species for habitat, c) reliance on a particular moisture regime or habitat, d) proximity to anthropogenic barriers, e) poor dispersal ability, f) pollinator versatility, g) reliance on a particular disturbance regime, and h) low genetic variation. To aid in the interpretation of proportions, the distribution of threatened species richness is shown in i). The spatial distributions of species’ vulnerability to seven supplementary factors is illustrated in (
