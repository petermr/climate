 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. It is important to assess the extent to which this is occurring and gaps in this response. Some reviews have examined this issue in South Africa [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>], but none have done so recently, or employed systematic review methodology. This study fills that gap and presents lessons from the response in South Africa that might be applied in other countries and, indeed, globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. In recent decades, South Africa has played a leading role in tackling public health issues affecting the African region, especially in the HIV field. The country has the potential, drawing on its research and programme expertise, to play a similar role in climate change adaptation, galvanising action in other parts of the continent. Thus, while the impacts of climate are somewhat unique to each country and even within different parts of a country, lessons drawn from this case study may provide useful insights for other countries in the region.
