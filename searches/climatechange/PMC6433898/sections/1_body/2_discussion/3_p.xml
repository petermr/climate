<p id="Par12" class="p">This study adds a further conceptual and empirical layer to the urgent need to develop ‘profiles’ of species facing risks of extinction. These profiles aim to summarize our current understanding of factors that contribute to altering the historical stability of populations, and thus, to reinforce the efficiency of actions developed to mitigate ongoing declines of biodiversity. However, one of the main limitations of this study is the bias generated by not considering the extremely endemic species in our analysis, which is related to the lack of enough geographic information to predict the potential distribution of these species.</p>
