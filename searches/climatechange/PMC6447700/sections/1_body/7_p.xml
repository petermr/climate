 <italic class="italic">Pinus uncinata</italic> seedlings (later saplings) were exposed to warming, one-time NPK fertilizer addition and/or interaction with the dominant shrub 
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron ferrugineum</italic>. Interestingly, they find that the nature of interactions with this shrub changed as the experiment went on, switching from facilitation by the shrub to competition and ultimately competitive release. Moreover, the impacts of warming and fertilization (including their interactions) differed depending on presence or absence of
