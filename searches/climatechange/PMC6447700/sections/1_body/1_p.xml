<p class="p">In trying to predict how ecosystems will respond to rapid climate warming, insights may be gained from warm periods in the past. Tree rings provide important information on historic temperatures at the treeline, where the primary limiting factor for tree growth is considered to be growing season temperature (Paulsen and Körner, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In this research topic,

 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> differed markedly between climate regimes. This could challenge the assumption that the correlation between temperature and radial tree growth limitation is stable over time. The micro-site climate is likely to play an important role here (Körner et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which has implications not only for temperature reconstructions, but also for other applications where absolute growth is important, such as dynamic vegetation models.
