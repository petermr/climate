<p class="p">The connection between the sources of local air pollution and the emissions that drive climate change is very clear. Estimations show that approximately 25% of urban ambient air pollution from fine particulate matter (PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) is contributed by traffic, 15% by industrial activities including electricity generation, 20% by domestic fuel burning (with a remaining 22% from unspecified sources of human origin and 18% from natural sources).
