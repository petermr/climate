<p class="p">Even more wide-ranging effects could be brought about by fiscal policy. Studies by the International Monetary Fund show that the global production and consumption of highly polluting fuels is indirectly subsidized with over 5 trillion United States dollars (US$) a year, which is more than all governments around the world spend on health care.

 </xref> This de facto subsidy exists because the health and climate damages that they cause are not reflected in fuel prices. Approximately half of these US$ 5 trillion are from the uncosted health impacts of air pollution, mainly from coal. Increasing the price of fuels, consistent with the damage that they cause to health and to the global climate system would remove this unfair advantage. Such increase would be expected to bring about a shift to cleaner energy sources that would reduce air pollution deaths by half, decrease global carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 20%, and generate about US$ 3 trillion a year in revenue.
