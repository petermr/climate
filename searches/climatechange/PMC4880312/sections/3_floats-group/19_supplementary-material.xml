   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0155137.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). The model was fitted to five imputed datasets using multinomial logistic regression. The mean null deviance = 1093.8, the degrees of freedom for the null model = 1656, mean residual deviance = 1081.3, and the residual degrees of freedom = 1652. The model fits the data significantly better than the null model (p = 0.014).
