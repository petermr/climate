<p id="Par12" class="p">The UK’s Adaptation Sub-Committee (ASC) has predicted that regional summer mean temperature will increase in Scotland between 0.9–4.5 °C by the 2050 s, of which 0.9 °C may already have occurred

 </sup> proposed that 10–20% of the 91% increase in UK surface water DOC over 15 years is explained by the 0.66 °C temperature increase, which equates to a 15.2–30.3% increase in surface water DOC per 1 °C temperature increase, or on average 22.7% per 1 °C. Based on these predictions, we developed a matrix of low/medium/high climate change scenarios, consisting of the various combinations of a 0, 1.8 or 3.6 °C increase in surface water temperature by 2050, and 15.2%, 22.7% or 30.3% increases in surface water DOC per 1 °C increase in surface water temperature. Considering the strong correlations observed in our case study we furthermore assumed that these changes in temperature and surface water DOC will correspond to those occurring in potable water at the point of disinfection.
