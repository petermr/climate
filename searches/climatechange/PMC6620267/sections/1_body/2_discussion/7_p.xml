<p id="Par23" class="p">Our analysis consequently suggests that environmental change affects surface water quality with implications for water treatment and its costs, as illustrated for the control of trihalomethanes formation in drinking water disinfection. Although this study focused on Scottish systems, implications of temperature change and associated changes in source water DOC are global. As such, equivalent studies are urgently elsewhere in the world to fully understand the health and cost implications of climate change on the world’s potable water supply.</p>
