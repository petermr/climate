<p id="Par19" class="p">Conducting the laboratory experiments not only firmly established the root causes of seasonal variation in THMs at our case study sites, but also quantified the sensitivity of THMs formation to changes in water temperature and DOC. These temperature and DOC sensitivities of THM formation measured in the laboratory, in combination with the observed changes in average monthly water temperatures and DOC concentrations during the calendar year, enabled us to predict and closely reproduce the seasonal variation in average THM concentrations in potable water observed at the five full-scale DWTPs. The close agreement between predictions and monitoring data gives us confidence in the use of the laboratory data for predicting future climate change related temperature and TOC concentration effects on THMs in full-scale DWTPs.</p>
