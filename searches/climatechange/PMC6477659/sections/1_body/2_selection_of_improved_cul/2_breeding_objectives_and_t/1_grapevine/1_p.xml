<p class="p">Hybridization between Euvitis species is efficient, opening the way for a large germplasm exploitation. The number of 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic> cultivars is estimated to be close to 5,000 and large germplasm collections are managed in most grape-growing countries (
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reisch et al., 2012</xref>). Some breeding objectives are common for wine and table grapes, concerning mainly disease resistances and adaptation to organic and sustainable viticulture, for which hybrids within 
 <italic class="italic">V. labrusca</italic> germplasm collection are used. Although not very widespread among grapevine-producing regions, adaptation to very cold temperatures (-20 to -35°C) is key in certain cultivation areas and, hence, considered in their respective breeding programs. For wine grape, the important traits are (a) the adaptation to vinification, and (b) aroma and flavors since these traits can be unfavorably affected when using other species than 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic> for breeding. For table grapes, the absence of seeds in berries is an important trait as well as the extension of the harvesting period. Rootstock breeding constitutes also an essential aspect in grapevine management and production. Adequate rootstock selection allows transferring resistance traits to the grafted variety such as soil-borne pests and diseases (including the damaging Phylloxera), nematodes, etc. In addition, rootstock provides several vigor and developmental advantages. Moreover, adaptation of plants to varying soil conditions and other abiotic constraints predominant in the Mediterranean region is also mediated by rootstock (
