<p class="p">Winegrape phenology is also very sensitive to climate change. Indeed, the timing of phenological events has changed between 1 and 2 weeks over the past decades (
 <xref rid="B267" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wolkovich et al., 2017</xref> and references therein). Regulation of timing of phenological events is a complex trait influenced by climate (determined by a subset of environmental cues), genetics, and a complex interaction of both factors. However, climate and more specifically temperature is the dominant factor controlling the pace of phenological events (

 <xref rid="B267" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wolkovich et al., 2017</xref>). The main phenological events linked to overall production and quality in grapes are (i) budburst, that requires daytime temperatures above 10°C to initiate growth, (ii) flowering that is generally accelerated by high temperatures, (iii) veraison (or color break) followed by (iv) ripening, these two being positively regulated by high temperatures although excessive exposure to high temperatures can be detrimental, and, finally, (v) maturity, that is determined by sugar accumulation, for which temperature is critical setting the optimal harvest date (

 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Martínez-Lüscher et al. (2016)</xref> evaluated the sensitivity of grapevine at different phenological stages to environmental conditions associated to climate change. According to their results, thermal time models seem to predict very accurately early phenological phases (budburst and flowering), but, as the growing season advances, other factors such as different cultural practices and water availability influence the timing of phenophases. According to 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ferrise et al. (2013)</xref>, the sequence of developmental processes will be accelerated advancing phenological phases, such as budbreak, flowering or ripening, with values ranging from 8 to 15 days. In general, the reproductive phase was the most affected resulting in shorter periods by an average of 6 days.
