<p class="p">As in other fruit crops, reproductive development is one of the main agronomical features that will be affected by climate change. Climate conditions before and during flowering and fruiting are of pivotal importance, first determining the number of flowers, initial fruit set and, subsequently, fruit yield. In olive trees, temperature and rainfall between autumn and spring (pre-flowering and beginning of flowering periods) determine the abundance and phenology of flowering (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aguilera and Valenzuela, 2012</xref>). Different flowering models coupled with climate predictions show that by the end of the 21st century, flowering could be anticipated by 10–17 days due to increasing temperatures during the pre-flowering period (

 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gabaldon-Leal et al., 2017</xref>). This could be advantageous, since shifting the critical flowering time frame from the warmer to the cooler periods would reduce heat-induced flower drop and, hence, increase the fruitlet success rate. However, within the current distribution area of olive tree orchards this might not be enough to cope with increasing temperatures during flowering in the southernmost locations, as the expected rise in spring temperatures and especially during flowering can have a deleterious impact on olive production (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gabaldon-Leal et al., 2017</xref>). Olive trees produce two types of inflorescences: perfect or hermaphrodite and imperfect or staminate, containing only a residual atrophied pistil. In a recent work, a 4°C temperature rise caused a reduction in the percentage of perfect flowers and fertile inflorescences as well as fruit set (

 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moreno-Alias et al., 2012</xref>). To this respect, selection of early-flowering varieties could constitute an alternative to adapt olive production to climate change in particularly sensitive areas.
