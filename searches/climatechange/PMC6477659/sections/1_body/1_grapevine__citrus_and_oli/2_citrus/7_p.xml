<p class="p">Changes in phenology derived from climate change are possibly the most important factor affecting citrus production in terms of marketability and profitability. Variations in the climatic patterns of citrus-producing areas will drastically influence tree phenology, flower and fruit development as well as its organoleptic composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Final fruit size is primarily determined during phase II of fruit development and it is associated to cell elongation, it is inversely correlated with number of competing fruitlets and also air temperature, as it regulates transpiration and, hence, water absorption. Optimal temperatures for enhancement of fruit growth rate appear to be in the 20–25°C range, temperatures outside this range will cause a reduction in fruit size either by slowing down growth rate or by increasing competition between developing fruitlets (

To this respect, soil moisture is also important to fruit growth rate throughout all stages of fruit development but particularly during early development. Flowering and fruit expansion characteristics need to be understood in relationship to fruit maturation and anticipated quality to maximize quality in subtropical-to-tropical climates.
