<p class="p">The ability of plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions and survive is dependent upon the activation of highly coordinated protective responses (
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peleg and Blumwald, 2011</xref>), resulting from the interaction between specific genetic components, the genetic landscape as well as with the particular environmental factors. This interaction is highly complex, therefore, the translation of genetic responses to field performance is not straightforward and many different factors may influence the outcome.
