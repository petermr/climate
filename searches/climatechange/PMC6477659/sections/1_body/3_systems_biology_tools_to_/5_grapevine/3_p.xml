<p class="p">In this new scenario, rational and precise breeding strategies require the unambiguous identification of ‘stress tolerant’ phenotypes to be associated to specific expression patterns. In a pioneering work,

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deluc et al. (2007)</xref> included transcript and metabolite analyses in vegetative and reproductive tissues of grapevine, respectively, depicting changes in response to abiotic stresses and during berry development. The manual integration of transcript and metabolite data allowed the identification of RuBisCo activase as an early response to water deprivation that was delayed under saline conditions. Moreover, water stress affected metabolism-associated transcripts whereas salinity had an impact mostly on protein synthesis and fate (

The transcript profiling data correlated well with metabolite profiles showing water-deprived grapevine tissues higher concentrations of glucose, malate, and proline than salt-stressed ones. Unfortunately, although this work included metabolite profiling data, no attempt to correlate transcript and metabolite profiling was carried out to provide a more insightful view of the regulatory processes involved in metabolite accumulation. In a recent work, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corso et al. (2016)</xref> performed RNA-Seq on leaves and roots of different grapevine genotypes with contrasting ability to tolerate water deprivation. Transcriptome analysis revealed the WRKY transcription factors (TFs)-dependent activation of secondary metabolism potentially leading to the accumulation of stilbenes and flavonoids. However, this extent could not be confirmed with a parallel metabolite analysis and no co-expression analysis to unbiasedly correlate specific TF activity with the induction of the biochemical response was attained. In both cases, the use of integrative approaches could have contributed to extract more significant knowledge from already collected data.
