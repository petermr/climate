<p class="p">Analysis of GCN has been applied in grapevine to identify ripening-associated functional sub-modules under water stress conditions (
 <xref rid="B229" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Savoi et al., 2017</xref>), revealing a strong interplay between key metabolites and structural genes and the involvement of VviMYBA1-2 in anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this work, GCN revealed major drought stress-regulated gene modules linked to central and specialized metabolites and multiple signal transduction pathways (e.g., anthocyanin and amino acid biosynthesis via members of VviAP2/ERF and VviNAC TF families). The activation of both abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and -independent pathways may act balancing the regulation of the stress response and the berry ripening program.
