<p class="p">Crop productivity in Southern Europe is already limited, mainly due to water scarcity and elevated temperatures. Taking as an example the heat wave that occurred in 2003, with temperature rises of 3–5°C and annual precipitation deficit of 300 mm that led to a decrease in gross agricultural production over a 30% in Europe, it is likely that climatic conditions similar to those of the year 2003 will be more frequent in the future (
