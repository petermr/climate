<p class="p">Changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations will be accompanied by severe water limitation and increases in average temperatures, posing several stress combinations with different outcomes (
 <xref rid="B282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zandalinas et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, 
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Medlyn (2011)</xref> showed that stomatal conductance and transpiration in woody plant species could decrease up to a 21% in parallel to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration rise, implying an increase in water use efficiency and subsequently an improvement of plant performance under water stress conditions. However, a concomitant increase of ambient temperature will increase evapotranspiration. Under these circumstances, the potential gain in yield caused by the higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels (
 <xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vara Prasad et al., 2005</xref>) would be compensated and even turned in net losses due to the negative effect of high temperature once the optimum values are surpassed (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fares et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B282" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zandalinas et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the identification of traits associated to greater yields under high ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> constitute a desirable breeding target in order to compensate losses due to episodes of extremely high temperatures (
