 <p class="p">Subsection “Genomic Analyses”, sixth paragraph – some logic behind the biggest differences in regions may include the following: The northern end is situated at a relatively high altitude (1,000 to 1,300 m) in a summer-rainfall zone and largely on basaltic soils. Altitude is associated with a whole suite of bioclimatic variables important for tree growth. The central region is the most complex in terms of geology and rainfall. Rainfall is also variable, generally decreasing with decreasing altitude and towards the west of the distribution. The southern inland section is in a winter-rainfall zone, has a wide altitudinal range (400 to 1,000 m) with the higher elevation areas receiving occasional falls of snow in winter, although the snow seldom persists on the ground for more than a few days. The underlying geology includes granodiorite and dolerite in the higher-altitude areas, siltstone, shale, and quartzite in the lower areas, plus small areas of basalt.</p>
