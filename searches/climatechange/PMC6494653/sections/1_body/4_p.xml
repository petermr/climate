<p class="p">A third of the world's population uses solid fuel derived from plant material (biomass) or coal for cooking, heating, or lighting. These fuels are smoky, often used in an open fire or simple stove with incomplete combustion, and result in a large amount of household air pollution. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate at room temperature. Many common household materials and products, such as paints and cleaning products, give off VOCs [

Several studies suggest that exposure to VOCs may worsen symptoms in asthmatics or are those particularly sensitive to chemicals.
