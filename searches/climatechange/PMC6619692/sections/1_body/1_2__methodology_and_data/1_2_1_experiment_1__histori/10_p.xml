Data for the period 1986–2010 are used for the calculation of three annual extreme rainfall timeseries using the RClimDex software. RClimDex is a user friendly graphical interface that facilitates the computation of up to 27 core ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme indices [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The indicator value for each country is obtained by averaging values of extremes timeseries over 2006–2011. The 2006–2011 period is the span over which demographic, socioeconomic and climate data are available across all 12 countries. As before the sub-index is calculated using an arithmetic average over the climate indicators.
