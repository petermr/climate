<p class="p">The studies all utilize aggregated vulnerability indices/scores that incorporate a range of indicators including proneness to natural disasters [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], risk of exposure to climate change and extreme events e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and economic losses that can be incurred with catastrophic events e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. An extensive review of country and community level vulnerability work for SIDS and the Least Developed Countries (LDC) is provided by [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Of note, [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] is the only report examined that includes climate change projections for the Latin America and the Caribbean in its aggregate approach. The report, however, does not focus on an increase or decrease to baseline climate parameters but rather measures the degree of change as representative of the necessity for that system (human or natural) to cope with a potential alteration of the current state.
