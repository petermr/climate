<p class="p">The change factor is obtained by calculating the difference between the average annual indicator value for the model baseline period and the average for each future period. The change factor is then applied to the historical intense rain indicator to obtain the future indicator value. For each location the future values of RX1, RX5 and R10 are then normalized (relative to other station values for the specific indicator) and combined to create the intense rain sub-index. In Experiment 2, this future sub-index is aggregated with the historical demography and socio-economic sub-indices to explore future comparative vulnerabilities across the region due only to a change in climate conditions. This process is undertaken for the SRES A2 (medium high emissions) and B2 (medium low emissions scenarios).</p>
