<p class="p">In this study statistical downscaling is used to determine changes in the heavy rainfall-sub-indices used in CVS for defined future periods (see Section 2). The climate projections are used to investigate the sensitivity of the relative vulnerabilities determined by CVS to global warming induced changes in the heavy rainfall profile of the Caribbean. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the only study to date that attempts to quantitatively incorporate climate model projected change in an aggregate vulnerability index for this region. The investigation is first done using the future climate projections with demographic and socio-economic sub-indices held constant (Experiment 2). The analysis using future climate is then repeated for two other scenarios–firstly with future demographic projections also incorporated and socioeconomic data held constant (Experiment 3); and secondly with different weightings applied to the climate (changing) versus non-climatic (constant) sub-indices (Experiment 4). The weightings used in Experiment 4 are explained in Section 2. All prior experiments assumed equal weightings for the sub-indices used in CVS. The aims of Experiments 2, 3 and 4 are respectively to examine (i) if projected changes in intra-regional variations in heavy rainfall due to global warming may alter present-day relative vulnerability rankings; (ii) the comparative influence of future changes in both climatic and non-climatic factors (relative to the present-day); and (iii) the potential sensitivity of the relative vulnerability assessments to the amount of influence assigned to the climate (changing) versus non-climatic (constant) sub-indices when formulating CVS.</p>
