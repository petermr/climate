<p class="p">Small island developing states (SIDS), including those in the Caribbean, are among the most vulnerable to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. A growing body of research suggests that for the region as a whole, climate changes already evident include more intense rain events, longer dry spells, higher and more frequent extreme temperatures and rising sea levels (see for e.g. [

This paper attempts to explore the role of intra-regional variation in exposure to climate extremes when determining comparative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean.
