<p class="p">In this study, the formulation of the CVS was guided by other aggregate indices of vulnerability found in the literature (
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). A deliberate attempt was, however, made to keep CVS simple in its formulation while still capturing potential variations in vulnerability to climate using climatic and non-climatic sub-indices. It was noted that of the 12 Caribbean countries examined in this study, locations in Jamaica, Guyana and Belize emerge as among the most vulnerable using historical values of the climate sub-index. This may suggest that these locations have a higher exposure to heavy rain hazards than many of the other locations examined in this study. Jamaica was again identified among the most vulnerable locations for the historical demographic sub-index suggesting an enhanced sensitivity likely due to a larger at-risk population. All three countries were also highlighted for elevated socio-economic vulnerability which likely indicates low adaptive capacity to risks posed by a changing climate. Furthermore, whether the scenario is less (more) intense rain events as generally suggested under the A2 (B2) scenario, Jamaica, Guyana and Belize are again identified as the most vulnerable locations for the 2030s and 2050s for the CVS premised on a changing climate with constant demographic and socioeconomic indices. Antigua was consistently identified as the least vulnerable.
