    <bold class="bold">Additional file 6: Figure S2.</bold> The additive logistic fit of 
    <italic class="italic">Lagopus muta japonica</italic> occurrence to four explanatory variables. Values on the y axis of (
    <bold class="bold">A</bold>) and (
    <bold class="bold">B</bold>), and contour lines in (
    <bold class="bold">C</bold>) show the linear predictor for the variables, which indicates the extent of positive and negative effects of each explanatory variable in the model. The dashed curves in (A) and (B) are pointwise two times of standard-error bands, which can be viewed as ~95% pointwise confidence intervals. Horizontal red dashed lines in (A) and (B) indicate the zero value of the estimate for each variable. Significant effects of explanatory variables on the model are shown in red, blue, and open boxes, which indicate positive, negative, and neutral, respectively, in (A) and (B). In (C), the warmer the color, the more positive the effect of the explanatory variables. Values on each contour line in (C) show the linear predictor for the two variables.
