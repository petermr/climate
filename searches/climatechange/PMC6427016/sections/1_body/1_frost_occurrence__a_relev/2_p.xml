<p id="Par5" class="p">The next step consists in applying the same spatial models to downscale climate change simulations (the “downscaling”

 </sup>). In such temperature estimates, the spatial variability is thus inherited from the statistical laws deduced, under current climate conditions, from the aforementioned interpolations, while the large-scale temporal variability of air temperature is derived from the global models involved in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 5

 </sup> (CMIP5). Using the same 200-m horizontal projected grid over the Mont-Blanc Massif and its surroundings, summer (JJA) and winter (DJF) mean temperature evolutions from 1850 to 2100 are compared to interpolated observations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Our data clearly show the heat wave for summer of 2003

 </sup>, while the trimester of DJF 1989–1990 holds the record for winter temperature over the period. Over their common period, the difference between observations and historical simulations allows for an estimate of the typical errors of climate models over this region (Supplementary Figure 2). Models over-estimate Tn both in summer and winter, and produce much more realistic results for Tx estimates. The amplitude of the future warming is strongly dependent on the emission scenario. Optimistic RCP2.6 produces stabilized temperatures at about +1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels: it is the only scenario that meets the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change locally, that is, a “temperature rise this century well below 2 Celsius degrees above pre-industrial levels”. Pessimistic RCP8.5 leads to a warming of roughly +2 °C in wintertime (+2.8 °C in summertime) by the mid-century, these values reaching respectively +3.8 °C and +5.6 °C for the late century. Although all downscaled models produce qualitatively similar results, uncertainties remain large, as denoted by the inter-model spread in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. For the late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century for instance, and from one model to another, summer temperature rise is comprised between +5 and nearly +9 °C for Tx (+4 °C to +7.5 °C for Tn). Depending on the models, the record heat wave of 2003 could become representative of a typical summer season between 2060 and 2075. The abnormally warm winter of 1989–1990 could represent the typical winters of the years 2070–2080.
