<p class="p">Our analysis focuses on historical precipitation and temperature change impacts on crop production and food security. Future studies should explore impacts from extreme temperature changes (for example determining thresholds [

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] both historically, as well as for the expected future warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and intensification of the hydrological cycle for larger number of crops as well as for livestock. Various agronomic changes and advancements can also mask climate change adaptation measures: irrigation expansion can occur for stabilizing crop production, expansion into new areas, or for double cropping in the dry season; but they can also serve as a measure to counter the effects of extreme heat [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Crop planting dates can advance in colder regions of the world as agronomic techniques advance but also because climate is getting warmer on average [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. These nuances should be explicitly modeled in future studies to tease out such individual contributions. Other related variables that could be considered in future global studies are radiation use efficiency changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], weed, pest and pathogen infestation changes [
