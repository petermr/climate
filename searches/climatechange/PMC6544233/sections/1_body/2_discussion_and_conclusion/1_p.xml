 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] (IPCC AR5) on climate change impact on crop yield/production notes that between the AR4 and AR5 the required connection of climate change impact to food security impact was missing. Our study directly addresses this by translating the potential impact of recent climate change on crop yields (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). While translating crop production change to consumable food caloric change, we accounted for the current dietary consumption pattern of individual crops per country, including bookkeeping for directly and indirectly consumed calories in each country [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We found that out of the studied 53 countries with a hunger index of serious, alarming, or seriously alarming [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] in 2008, 27 countries (or ~51%) had decreased consumable calories due to mean climate changes (~ -0.4% in these ten crops or ~ -0.3% across all food calories consumed across all 53 countries studied–

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), determining consumable food caloric changes at that level would require data not available globally: subnational dietary patterns, evaluation of the climate change impact in the entire food supply chain [
