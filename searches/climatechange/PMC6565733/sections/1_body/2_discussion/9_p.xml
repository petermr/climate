 </sup>. Based on the adaptive capacity model (Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref> and Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), we noted the majority of estimated highly adaptive communities are located in Nunatsiavut and Nunavik. Communities in Nunavik had high scores due to generally higher high school graduation and trade certificate attainment, as well as high presence of Inuktitut in households. For communities in Nunatsiavut, attainment of high school and trades certificates in the five communities increased relative scores. The lowest levels of adaptive capacity, as captured in the model, are distributed across the Central Arctic and Kivalliq region. This was due to lower levels of high school and trade certificate attainment and lower CWI scores.
