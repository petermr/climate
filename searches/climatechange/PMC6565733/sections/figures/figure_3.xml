   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Rain exposure maps. Rain exposure model for 49 Inuit Nunangat communities including baseline and future RCP 4.5–8.5 scenarios (2040, 2070, 2100). Boxplot includes baseline and RCP 4.5 (blue) and RCP 8.5 (red) scenarios mean values, max-min values and outliers (when applicable). The boxplot 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis represents the baseline and the subsequent scenarios and the 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>-axis the mean exposure values. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Communities rain exposure graph. Accumulative rain model exposure for 49 communities including baseline and future scenarios for the multiplicative equation. Yellow bars represent baseline period and orange gradient bars delimit RCP 4.5 and 8.5 future scenarios. The community of Quaqtaq was not included in the rain and snow models due to unavailability of physical features for its entire buffer
