 <result pre="in Southeast Asia Despite evidence of ROs focussing attention on" exact="climate" post="change and health (see e.g. [ 10, 13]), literature"/>

 <result pre="55]. Another weakness is that the project aim of reducing" exact="climate" post="change vulnerabilities of poor and marginalised populations is not"/>
 <result pre="objective of improving the coping capacity of governments to health-related" exact="climate" post="change impacts. It is possible that some of these"/>
 <result pre="organisations also report positively on outputs relating more directly to" exact="climate" post="and health. For example, in 2016 the APRF reported"/>
 <result pre="had produced a NEHAP, with nine of the 12 including" exact="climate" post="change as an environmental health issue [ 66]. Similarly,"/>

 <result pre="and UNEP, governments across the region can meet to discuss" exact="climate" post="change and health issues, reflecting &quot;their national interests and"/>
 <result pre="lack of CCTWG meetings is indicative of low prioritisation of" exact="climate" post="change and health, the re- endorsement of the CCTWG"/>

 <result pre="a strong possibility that any funds sought would be for" exact="climate" post="change and health because of the increasing global prioritisation"/>
 <result pre="means duplicated effort in national agencies responsible for health and" exact="climate" post="change concerns. For example, national agencies, such as the"/>
