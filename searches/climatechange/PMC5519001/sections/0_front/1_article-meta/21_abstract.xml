 <p class="p">Hantavirus, hosted by rodent species, causes HCPS, a disease with a 50% mortality rate in humans. The conversion of native vegetation to sugarcane increases the abundance of hantavirus reservoir rodent species, augmenting disease risk. Additionally, temperature also has positive effects on disease risk because it affects rodent population and the time the virus remains infectious in the environment. Here we evaluate the impacts of climate change and sugarcane expansion on HCPS risk. Expansion of sugarcane increases average HCPS risk placing 20% more people at risk for acquiring HCPS than under current conditions. Temperature anomalies increase HCPS risk even more and place 31% and 34% more people at risk (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively). Our results confirm the impacts of climate change and agriculture expansion on disease risk and highlight the need for timely and efficient planning of operational control programs in order to avoid disease propagation in the future.</p>
