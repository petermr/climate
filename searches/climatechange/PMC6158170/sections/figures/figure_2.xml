  <p class="p">Projected changes in Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) using the methods of Hargreaves (Har; left panels) and Hamon (Ham; right panels) for 2 °C global warming scenario (upper panels), 1.5 °C global warming scenario (middle panels) and the difference between the two scenarios (lower panels). Changes for 2 °C and 1.5 °C are expressed as a percent of reference period values. Differences between the changes of the two scenarios are expressed as percent of the 1.5 °C ones. Only areas where changes are significant at 90% are shaded.</p>
