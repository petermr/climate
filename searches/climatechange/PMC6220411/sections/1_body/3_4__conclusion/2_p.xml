<p class="p">Our study has a number of limitations. First, because of data limitations, we have used annual data to examine the relationship between the incidence of LD and climatic variables. Thus, we were unable to address the seasonality of LD cases throughout the year, as highlighted by Moore et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] and the climate change influences on the annual onset of LD, as studied by Monaghan et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Second, we have focused our analysis on counties from the highest incidence states, regardless of the spatial distribution of blacklegged ticks. Hence, we cannot comment on whether these reported cases were autochthone—most likely the vast majority of the cases—or imported. In an ongoing research project, we are examining the climate-LD incidence relationship over U.S. counties with established tick population versus counties with ticks reported, but not yet established. Third, although we have overcome a number of omitted variable bias issues with the fixed effects analysis, we have not scaled our results relative to areas with few LD cases. In work still in progress, we are using a border approach to compare our estimates for the places with high incidence of LD with estimates for their corresponding neighboring areas.
