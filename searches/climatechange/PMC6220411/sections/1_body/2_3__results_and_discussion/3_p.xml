<p class="p">We now describe the results from our preferred specification (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, column 3). Relative to counties with annual average temperature above 15°C, counties with annual average temperature below 5°C have 1.6 additional cases of LD per 100,000 population, but this estimate is not statistically significant (not distinguishable from zero, or alternatively not distinguishable from the reference group). That estimate jumped to 10.7 cases per 100,000 population for counties with annual average temperature between 5 and 7°C, and to 15.1 for counties with annual average temperature between 7 and 9°C. Then, it stabilized for counties with annual average temperature between 9 and 11°C—14.4 cases per 100,000 population—but dropped to 5.3 and 3.9 for counties with annual average temperature between 11 and 13°C, and 13 and 15°C, respectively. We display these estimates more clearly in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>, where we can see the approximately concave or inverted-U shape of the incidence of LD response to temperature.
