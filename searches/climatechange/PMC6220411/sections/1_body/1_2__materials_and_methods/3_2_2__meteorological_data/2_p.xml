<p class="p">Once we merged the information of LD cases with climatic variables, our sample contained a balanced panel of 468 U.S. counties over the period 2000–2016. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref"> Figure 1</xref> displays the counties in our sample in the map of the United States, with color code based on the incidence of LD. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> reports the summary statistics of our sample. Observe that most of the counties used in our sample come from Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Also, notice that the temperature bins with the highest shares of observations cover the range 7–13°C and the precipitation bins with the largest shares cover the range 70–220 cm.
