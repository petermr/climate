<p class="p">The gathered information from the relevant papers was scrutinized for topics and issues related to climate change that do or would benefit from integrated approaches to health and from which an added value of a closer cooperation of human and animal health could be expected, based on our previous experience as outlined above. In the selected papers, the topics of food security and safety and extensive livestock systems and pastoralism were found prominently cited in relation to climate change, environmental sanitation appeared as a further topic of the interaction of climate change and One Health followed by the potential of integrated surveillance and response systems in relation to climate change-related emerging diseases. These themes are clearly not exhaustive, and further potential of One Health to mitigate the effects of the changing climate can be expected in the near future.</p>
