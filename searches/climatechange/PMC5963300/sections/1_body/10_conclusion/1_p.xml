<p class="p">Here we presented an account of the unmatched value of a One Health approach over the conventional public health approach. Its advantages go beyond human and animal health. One Health is well suited for community-based contextual problem solving through transdisciplinary processes. It is this aspect of One Health which suggests the groundbreaking directions in the pursuit of high networking of different disciplines and that garnered the attention of both scientific and non-scientific communities. In the case of climate change, integrated One Health approach offers societally meaningful collaborative efforts to reconcile scientific disciplines, policy making and local knowledge by engaging non-academic stakeholders and different academic disciplines to act together locally, nationally and globally to address and solve health problems related to climate change.</p>
