<p class="p">The effect of methane production from rumination on climate change is known (Watts

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). A broader examination of this issue reveals that the ongoing increase of livestock production in the developing world elevates millions of small scale farmers out of the poverty trap (FAO 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). At the same time, enormous increases in meat consumption in emerging middle classes in low and middle income countries contribute, albeit not exclusively, to an epidemiological transition and double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (Boutayeb 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). As mentioned above, large areas of the world, for instance, semi-arid high and lowlands, could not sustain human life without use of livestock (Zinsstag 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Climate change with increased droughts requires a high flexibility of mobile pastoralists and may lead to increased social conflicts when they must move into areas used by others (Herrero 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). An integrated societal view on global livestock production argues that ruminant livestock rearing should, within the limits of capacity of such social-ecological systems, be concentrated in semi-arid areas which cannot be used otherwise. In parallel, ruminant feedlot production would be stabilized or even decreased to reduce the climate impact of ruminant livestock and reserve substantial cereal food resources for human consumption. Altogether, a stabilization or reduction of global ruminant meat consumption seems inevitable and may have additional positive health effects.
