<p class="p">One Health approaches show clear advantages over conventional public and animal health approaches not only for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change (Shomaker, Green and Yandow 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), but also for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and many non-communicable diseases. A main problem is lack of intersectoral collaboration, and particularly between the medical and veterinary communities, perhaps due to already full curricula with little time for adding integrated courses, despite evidence for the higher cost of overspecialization and lack of communication between sectors (Enserink 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). There is an urgent need to include One Health meaningfully into medical and veterinary curricula (Rabinowitz

There is no need for new ministries or academic institutions if people are well trained and informed. Existing legal systems are adequate to regulate professional services in all sectors, but mechanisms to work better together and to communicate fully between the involved sectors of human health, animal health and environmental heath are of high priority (Videla and Urzua
