<p class="p">Climate change adaptation policies may benefit from knowledge of the mental health risks associated with a changing climate, resources required to reduce these risks, and of key factors that can influence the magnitude and pattern of mental health outcomes. Health authorities can obtain this information through vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and in collaborations with partners to reduce the health consequences of climate-related hazards. Further, this information can be used by health care providers to support individuals and communities to more effectively manage mental health issues associated with climate variability and change.</p>
