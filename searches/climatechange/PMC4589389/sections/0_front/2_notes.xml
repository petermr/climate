 <title class="title">Data Availability</title>
 <p class="p">Some data are available within the paper and its Supporting Information. The General Social Survey and its background information is publicly available through NORC at 
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/</ext-link>. The authors are not authorized to re-publish these data because they were obtained from a third party, but anyone can access the data from NORC. For the authors' regional datasets (GSP and CERA/CAFOR), multiple human-subjects protection agreements explicitly state that individual-level data cannot be made freely available. De-identified subsets of the individual-level data are available upon request to interested researchers, pending Institutional Review Board approval. Please send requests for the data to the corresponding author, Lawrence Hamilton.
