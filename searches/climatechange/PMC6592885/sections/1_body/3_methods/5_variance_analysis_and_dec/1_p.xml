 </sup> were conducted using climatic and agro-climatic indices coming from downscaled outputs under conditions identified by four factors. A split-plot design with 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic> as main plot, and 
 <italic class="italic">GCM</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">RCP</italic> as sub- and sub-sub-plots was further extended to accommodate a fourth factor - weather generator (CLIMAK, LARS-WG, WeaGETS) - through additional subdivision of each sub-sub-plot into sub-sub-subplot. For the ANOVA, years were used as replication within each 20-year period. Here, the ANOVA tests were based on Rfit code

 </sup>. Though the nonparametric ANOVA adopted does not require the assumptions of homogeneity of variance between the groups and the normality of residuals, a balanced design (the same amount of index values for each level of each factor) is required to detect the differences between the groups. Flaws in the generation process ended in having a limited set of series fulfilling the requirements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). The reason is that the failure in one RCP × GCM × WG combination drives to failure for the whole location when trying to compare future projections. When one site encountered failures only in future scenarios, it was used in the analysis performed on the baseline (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Vice versa, when errors occurred only in the baseline generation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), series were only included in the analysis of future scenarios. In this way, all the ANOVA tests were performed according to a balanced design, depending on the occurrence of failures during weather generation.
