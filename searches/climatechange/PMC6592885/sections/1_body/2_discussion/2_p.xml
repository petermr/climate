<p id="Par12" class="p">While framing the uncertainty arising from using multiple WGs in the downscaling process, our study points out the (risk of) high dependence of climate change impact calculations on WGs (beyond the physics underlying the GCMs and the socio-economic scenarios driving the RCPs). Our results stress the need of verification of the appropriateness of several climate change studies using WG for downscaling, whose uncertainty - on the basis of what we observed - could be larger than expected. The application of our procedure to downscaled climate projections may provide information on the characteristics of uncertainty in local climate projections. In the context of agriculture and food security, this would consist of an ensemble of WGs, compared across an ensemble of crop models in a variety of agricultural regions. While there may be no best overall WG, the breadth of stochastic generation analysis can be used to provide end users with indication of the variability related to the stochastic weather generation. In conclusion, our findings advocate incorporation of alternative WG-based downscaling techniques as routine tools for the multi-ensemble methodology that already uses alternative RCPs/GCMs in impact studies. This would facilitate a move towards a complete assessment of uncertainty in simulations.</p>
