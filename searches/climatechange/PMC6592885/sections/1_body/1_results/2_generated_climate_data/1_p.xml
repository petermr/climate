<p id="Par5" class="p">Ensembles of baseline and future climate data (from four GCM × RCP combinations) were downscaled with three alternative WGs in mutiple sites worldwide (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). LARS-WG returned complete data series in each situation, whereas CLIMAK and WeaGETS did not generate data for some sites and for some GCM × RCP combinations. The analysis of CLIMAK results also revealed the occurrence of some abnormal numerical values in weather series that were thus not included in further analysis.
