<p id="Par9" class="p">For each climate index, the proximity of different GCM × RCP combinations was assessed by approximating the area of overlap of the probability density distributions of the index values obtained with each WG. The results summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,b</xref> return a quite high likelihood (0.7) to obtain the same value for different indices regardless of the GCM × RCP combination. This likelihood was indeed higher than the average resemblance of generated to reference baselines (&lt;0.5). While a strong dependence of results on geographical location (site-specific) was somewhat expected, the most interesting outcome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>) was that results from different GCMs and RCPs tended to cluster by WG (more than by site). Given the influence of the different WGs on climate scenarios, the additional uncertainty that may result from the interaction between generation (WGs) and projections (GCMs and RCPs) was analyzed. A series of nonparametric robust rank order ANOVA tests was thus conducted to assess the effect of different factors (
