<p id="Par8" class="p">Results from a robust rank-based ANOVA-like method (factors being 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic>) are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Most of the indices were significantly affected (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) by both 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic>. Their interaction was also often significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, indicated with red in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic> frequently resulted as the most probable source of differences rather than 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic>. However, for some indices (mainly those based on percentiles, since they are sensitive to extreme values, like tx90p - percentage of days having 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">max</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile), 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic> explained most of the variability observed. Some indices based on maximum and minimum daily air temperatures were often more affected by the 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic> than by the 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic>. For temperature-based indices, this was observded for monthly minimum of daily minima (TNN), as well as for monthly maximum of daily maxima (TXX).
