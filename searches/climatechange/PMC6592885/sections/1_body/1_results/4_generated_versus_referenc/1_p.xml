<p id="Par7" class="p">The analysis of generated weather series revealed the ability of each WG to reproduce the distribution of the values of an extended list of climate indices (reported in Supplementary Information) calculated on the reference series. The polar graph of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> represents the multivariate system created with the set of indices used, with indices plotted on each radial axis. In particular, the value plotted on each axis represents the probability for reference and generated series to be the same for that index. The closer the contour lines are to one (thick black circle in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), the more similar the probability density functions for the two populations. Therefore, for each index, values close to one indicate a good agreement between generated and reference distributions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows how the WGs differed for their likelihood to reproduce the most-probable value of each index (peaks in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Some indices scored poorly regardless of the generator and the site (probably in relation to peculiarities inherent to reference weather series). However, while WeaGETS and LARS-WG offered a relatively more stable performance across the sites, the series generated by CLIMAK were often the most similar to reference ones.
