<p id="Par4" class="p">This section first reports on the generated data and rice yield estimates obtained with a crop model, followed by an analysis of integrated climate indices calculated on both reference baseline and generated series. In the last part of the section, we address the effect of using alternative WGs on a set of climate indices by applying rank-based ANOVA to assess sources of uncertainty in the generation of downscaled future climate projections.</p>
