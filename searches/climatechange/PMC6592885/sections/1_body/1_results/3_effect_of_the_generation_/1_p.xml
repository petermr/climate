<p id="Par6" class="p">The ranges of variation in projected rice yields (percentage changes in future scenarios with respect to the baseline) differed widely across sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, distinct increases in rice yield were projected at the Brazilian site with all scenarios and WGs, whereas an opposite response was found in China but a more complex pattern was visible in other sites. With few exceptions, responses from different scenarios tended to cluster around the same WG; the same behaviour is advisable in aggregate aridity and climate classification indices (Supplementary Information). This indicates that overall variability due to alternate WGs (different colors in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) may be larger than that induced by GCM × RCP combinations (different shapes in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The study case in Italy shows that rank reversal might also occur in rice yield projections when different WGs are used. For instance, either positive (with LARS-WG) or negative (with WeaGETS) impact was projected using HadGEM2-ES × RCP8.5 scenario. With different WGs, changes in projected impacts on rice yield was about ±5%. This is not a trivial value if for a big rice producer like China
