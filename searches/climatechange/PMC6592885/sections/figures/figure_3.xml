   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Overall fit of weather series for each index (one monthly index for each axis with code labels as reported in Supplementary Information); solid black lines indicate perfect fit to reference data. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Distribution density of the fit of all the indices analyzed (the closer to one, the more the whole set of reference distributions is reproduced by the WGs).
