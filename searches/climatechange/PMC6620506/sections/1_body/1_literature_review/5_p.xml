<p class="p">A study on change impacts and adaptation of the Swaziland sugar industry by Knox et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) indicate that climate change is already affecting sugarcane farmers in the country. The authors indicate that climate change will likely render the current peak capacity of existing sugarcane irrigation schemes in Swaziland inadequate to fulfil the projected increases in irrigation demand in almost 50% of the years under unlimited water availability. Climate change will place more pressure on the existing challenges that include loss of farm productivity and change in land suitability for current agriculture commodities (Tsabedze
