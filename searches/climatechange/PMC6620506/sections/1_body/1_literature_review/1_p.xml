<p class="p">Adaptive capacity is considered by Engle (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) as the positive features of a system to reduce vulnerability. Adaptive capacity represents the set of both biophysical and socio-economic factors that determine people’s ability to cope with stress or change in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and impacts of weather and climate-related events (Nicholls, Hoozemans &amp; Marchand 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Research indicates that farmers’ ability to perceive climate change is a very critical precondition for their resultant choice to adapt (Gbetibouo 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Decentralising power to local levels such as SSFAs to promote adaptive capacity against climate change stresses will have to include planning, management and monitoring of natural and other resources (WRI
