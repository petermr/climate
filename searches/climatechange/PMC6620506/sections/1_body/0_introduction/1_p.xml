<p class="p">Climate change has become the primary environmental concern of the 21st century (Dessler &amp; Parson 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Africa remains one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change because of its poor adaptive capacity (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Among the representative key risks for the region are compounded stress on water resources, reduced crop productivity and livelihood as well as food insecurity. Researchers have observed temperature increases coupled with impacts on the physical and biological systems over the past century (Maponya &amp; Sylvester 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Literature indicates that any future change in climate will most certainly have some form of impact, not only on conditions of the physical environment but also on the overall socio-economic aspects of life. Climate change effects on rainfall and temperature render agriculture the most susceptible sector (Mahendra
