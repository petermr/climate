<p class="p">This article reviews published studies over the health impact of climate change in Chinese cities according to the following four climate change phenomena identified under the modified Watts Framework 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>): (i) raised average and extreme temperature, (ii) altered rainfall pattern, (iii) sea-level rise and (iv) extreme weather events. Pathway of impacts and health outcomes will be discussed under each component. Given the vast area of China, there are marked regional climate variations and concerns, which will be covered in the review where appropriate. For a more focused and in-depth analysis, our review confines to the exposure, pathways and outcomes covered by the Framework and does not cover other related concepts including adaptation co-benefits.
