<p class="p">Extreme weather events refer to disasters involving hydrological hazard (e.g. flood), meteorological hazard (e.g. storm) and climatological hazard (e.g. drought) and cause a number of health outcomes. For China, flood is the weather-related disaster that causes the highest number of mortality and the largest amount of economic loss, with inland river flood along the Yangtze River region particularly relevant, while storm/typhoon has the most number of occurrences.
