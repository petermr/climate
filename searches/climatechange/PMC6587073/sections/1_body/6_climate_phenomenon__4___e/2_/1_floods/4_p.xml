<p class="p">Mental health is an under-researched health outcome in climate change studies, and climate change-related impact on mental health is most often associated with extreme weather events. Only a handful of research papers were identified for Chinese cities, and they were mostly related to the flood in Hunan province in 1998. The research covered mainly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): from its prevalence, risk factors and recovery. Data from various researches suggested the prevalence of PTSD to be around 10% among the victims.
