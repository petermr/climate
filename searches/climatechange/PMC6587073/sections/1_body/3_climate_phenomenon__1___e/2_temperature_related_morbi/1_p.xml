<p class="p">Morbidity (all-cause and cause-specific) is much less frequently used as study outcome than mortality in examining the health impact of climate change in the reviewed studies. A number of studies examined the association between temperature variability (including maximum daily temperature, DTR, temperature change between neighboring days, heat waves, cold spells) and overall health impacts through proxy outcomes such as all-cause hospital admissions, emergency room visits and ambulance dispatches. Among those that measure cause-specific morbidities, cardiovascular diseases have been the main focus, with increasing attention on heat-related illnesses.</p>
