Places with high or growing human population as well as increasing climate variability, have a reduced ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for these services is most critical. A spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation often ensues in such places. We apply different global conservation schemes as proxies to examine the spatial relation between wet season precipitation, population change over three decades, and natural resource conservation. We pose two research questions: 1) Where are biodiversity and ecosystem services vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and population growth? 2) Where are human populations vulnerable to degraded ecosystem services? Results suggest that globally only about 20% of the area between 50 degrees latitude North and South has experienced significant change&#x02013;largely wetting&#x02013;in wet season precipitation. Approximately 40% of rangelands and 30% of rainfed agriculture lands have experienced significant precipitation changes, with important implications for food security. Over recent decades a number of critical conservation areas experienced high population growth concurrent with significant wetting or drying (e.g. the Horn of Africa, Himalaya, Western Ghats, and Sri Lanka), posing challenges not only for human adaptation but also to the protection and sustenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Identifying areas of climate and population risk and their overlap with conservation priorities can help to target activities and resources that promote biodiversity and ecosystem services while improving human well-being.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations development process was carried out through U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) cooperative agreement #G09AC000001 and #G14AC00042.

Already climate change impacts, such as phenological changes and range shifts, have been documented for many species [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As with human populations, species vulnerability to climate change is a function of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although predictive models have forecast dramatic rates of global extinction due to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], there is great heterogeneity in the sensitivity and response of individual species [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Relatively few recent species extinctions can be definitively attributed to climate change, because of interactions with other anthropogenic threats like habitat loss [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, it is widely agreed that the greatest cause of biodiversity loss is habitat loss and degradation resulting from land-use change [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Habitat loss and fragmentation affect species&#x02019; sensitivity to and ability to respond to climate change (e.g. climate-driven range shifts may be limited by landscape patterns), amplifying the negative effects of both stressors [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The processes of land use and land cover change and conversions, deforestation, and land degradation are driven by a complicated array of interacting factors that vary geographically and politically. Some underlying causes of change and degradation are shifting markets, commodity prices, poverty, political structures, policies and governance, and population growth (including in-migration) [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Growing human populations put increased pressure on ecosystems for food, fuel, fiber, and water.</p><p>Similarly, climate change is expected to shift agricultural production and potential. In some areas climate change is expected to make conditions more favorable for meeting growing demands on ecosystems and cultivated systems; in other regions conditions are expected to worsen, making it difficult for ecosystems to meet human needs [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Reductions in productivity in one region may increase demand in other regions where productivity has benefited from climate change [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. When technological advancement and agricultural intensification are insufficient to meet demand, agricultural expansion is a major source of land use and land cover change and conversion [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Recurring droughts affecting food security (combined with population growth and insecure land tenure) have been linked to land use/land cover changes. For example, Acacia woodlands have declined in the central Rift Valley in Ethiopia as farmers have shifted from predominantly pastoral livelihoods to a crop-livestock mixed farming system as a better strategy to reduce vulnerability to drought [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similar patterns were observed in the northeastern Afar Rangelands of Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the eastern part of the Gran Chaco, Argentina, an increase in rainfall improved rainfed agricultural conditions while simultaneously deforestation accelerated in comparison to the western part where rainfall did not increase ([<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Simulations in Burkina Faso predict transformation of grasslands of the Sahel to cropland due to increased precipitation in the north and conversion of woodlands into croplands in the south driven by demand for agricultural products, accompanied by changes in plant species distributions and diversity [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In some cases, however, growing urban population and urban and international demand for forest and agricultural products are stronger correlates of forest loss than rural population growth [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggesting that distal global forces can amplify or attenuate local factors leading to land use changes and conversions [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Human populations most reliant on natural systems and least responsible for climate change tend to be the ones most vulnerable to and most burdened by negative impacts of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Rural populations, particularly in developing countries, are uniquely vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate changes because they depend directly on climate-sensitive natural resources including local sources of drinking water, agricultural lands, livestock forage, and other natural products [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Both negative and positive impacts of climate change on agricultural potential may lead to deforestation and ecosystem degradation through land clearing and shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation. This reduces the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including carbon sequestration, and causes greenhouse gas emissions&#x02013;further contributing to climatic change. In some cases, activities that can help households adapt to climate change, such as agricultural extensification, intensification, or livelihood diversification may degrade and deplete the natural resources that act as a safety net, especially for vulnerable groups like women [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In response to the dramatic decline in biodiversity, a number of organizations have created global prioritization schemes for biodiversity conservation. These prioritizations are usually based on some combination of irreplaceability (usually measured as endemism of one or more taxa), species richness, and vulnerability (often assessed as habitat loss, threatened species, land tenure, or human population growth and density); sensitive ecoregions or biomes [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] form the basis of several of the schemes [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In recognition of the extent to which humans have altered ecosystems, Ellis and Ramankutty [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] developed the concept of &#x0201c;anthromes&#x0201d; or anthropogenic biomes to characterize and map human interactions with terrestrial biomes and subsequent modifications. Their research reveals notable heterogeneity in human impacts globally. Potential interactions of human population growth and biodiversity have yet to be assessed within the context of global climate change.</p><p>In this paper, we examine the spatially explicit relationships among change in rainfall during the wettest three months of the year (one metric of climate change), population growth, and biodiversity over 30 years. Our two overarching questions are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Where are biodiversity and conservation priorities vulnerable to climate change and population growth (primarily through agricultural extensification)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Where might human populations be at risk from negatively impacted ecosystem services?</p></list-item></list><p>We hypothesize that in regions experiencing drying or reduced agricultural potential, particularly where this drying coincides with population increase, there will be greater pressure on ecosystems to obtain alternative livelihoods [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170615.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although wetting may improve agricultural conditions in some cases, when increasing precipitation is concentrated in few rainfall events, chance of soil erosion and flooding greatly increase, making agriculture more uncertain. While agricultural productivity is a function of many hydrometeorological factors, monitoring precipitation as a surrogate for agricultural moisture availability captures the largest source of variability in the crop water balance. With this in mind, we use rainfall during the wettest consecutive three months of the year as a proxy for growing season water availability. In addition, we posit that areas experiencing wetting or improvement of agricultural conditions are likely to see an expansion of agriculture, particularly on formerly marginal and environmentally sensitive lands [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as they become more productive or are called upon to meet demands (both food and biofuels) unmet from declining productivity elsewhere. Where increased agricultural productivity coincides with population growth, these pressures will be greater; however, because demands are often regional or global, they may be decoupled from local population patterns [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Our approach consists of a multi-step combination of several spatiotemporally explicit datasets to identify areas of overlap between long-term precipitation changes, population changes and areas of concern for biodiversity conservation. We identified areas across the globe that have experienced significant changes in rainfall over the past 30 years. We use the climatological wettest three months of precipitation as a percentage of the mean annual precipitation received, measured as a standardized precipitation index (SPI). We chose this metric to account for variations in timing and in quantities of rainfall across the globe making comparisons possible. In areas of rain-fed agriculture, this metric may be a proxy for agricultural potential (along with temperature, evaporation rate and other factors we do not directly account for). We propose that areas experiencing greater magnitudes of change may experience greater direct effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as changes in species composition or rates of primary productivity. We restrict our analysis to between 50 degrees latitude north and south to align with the chosen precipitation product. This spatial limitation is imposed by rainfall training data, which identifies a relationship between cloud top temperatures and rainfall rate [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We combined the climate data with spatial data on population change, biodiversity conservation priorities, and human livelihoods and examined the spatial intersection of these datasets in ARCGIS 10.1.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Precipitation Data</title><p>We identify regions across the globe (between 50 degrees latitude north and south) where significant changes in rainfall have occurred during the main growing season months within the last 33 years. We use rainfall data compiled by the University of California Santa Barbara Climate Hazards Group known as the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations version 2 (CHIRPSv2, [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). Using the CHRIPSv2 dataset, for each 0.05 degree pixel, a 1981&#x02013;2013 time series of main growing season rainfall was produced. This primary growing season was defined at each pixel as the three-month period with the highest climatological mean rainfall. While this interval may not align with the primary growing season at every location, it does generally hold for rainfed agriculture, and in those locations where it does not align with the growing season it serves as a proxy for crop available water resources. Time series of these three month accumulations were then transformed into standardized precipitation index (SPI) time series using the gamma distribution to parameterize the historical values [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The SPI calculates rainfall anomalies from main wet season precipitation as normalized variables, which convey the probabilistic significance of the observed or estimated rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For each pixel, we calculated the trend (using a linear regression algorithm in IDL) in SPI over the time period. Finding the trend in SPI allows us to identify meaningful shifts in rainfall at each location in a way that looking at rainfall amounts may not capture. We screened out areas where the trend was not statistically significant at the <italic>p</italic> = 0.05 level to identify only those pixels with a statistically significant change in wetting or drying. These pixels were classified as wetting (positive slope) or drying (negative slope) and all other pixels were classified as neither.</p><p>To make sure that the trends identified in the SPI were also meaningful in physical terms, the regression coefficients were screened as both a change in millimeters per year and as a percentage of the mean annual precipitation. Those locations where the absolute value of the trend was less than 1.5 mm/year, or roughly 50 mm over the CHIRPS time series, were classified as "no trend" to make sure that fairly small trends in rainfall accumulation were not highlighted as meaningful in biophysical terms. The second step of the analysis included checks to ensure that the absolute value of the trend is one-half of one percent of the average rainfall in the wettest three months, or roughly 15% over the entire CHIRPS time series. This check avoids including seemingly large trends in terms of millimeters, but which are dwarfed by the mean in exceptionally wet areas, and therefore fairly inconsequential to vegetation and agricultural growing conditions. Conversely, in drier areas, relatively small changes in rainfall could produce large percent changes due to the small average (i.e. dividing by a small number), even though the change in rainfall is not physically meaningful for plant physiology. In this way, the screening of trends in terms of millimeters and percent change identifies locational and phenologically important trends in rainfall. While these conditions may seem rather conservative, it allows us to focus the analysis on only those places that exhibit clear and important precipitation trends. The resulting map captures statistically significant trends in precipitation that potentially impact vegetation and agricultural development in the critical part of the rainy season. One important issue to note is that off-season rainfall is not considered in these trends, and while that is generally not a significant source of rainfall, there are some places where rainfall outside of the three wettest months can be impactful to agricultural productivity, rangeland biomass and water resources.</p><p>While the chosen thresholds screen for only the most significant trends are a bit restrictive, the result is that only the most critical of trends are highlighted. To be sure, some locally important trends are removed through this screening process, but this paper seeks to identify the most certain trends and assess their impacts. The map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g001">Fig 1</xref> identifies those areas with significant trends during the wettest three-month period of the year according to the CHIRPSv2 dataset from 1981&#x02013;2013.

GPW gridded population data consists of estimates of human population for different years (1990, 1995, and 2000) at 2.5 arc-minute grid cells and uses a proportional allocation gridding algorithm based on more than 300,000 national and sub-national administrative units to assign population values to grid cells. We used the population density grids that are derived by dividing the population count grids by the land area grid and represent persons per square kilometer. The Future Estimates population data consists of estimates of human population for the years 2005, 2010, and 2015 by 2.5 arc-minute grid cells with population values that are extrapolated based on a combination of sub-national growth rates from census dates and national growth rates from United Nations statistics. All of the grids have been adjusted to match United Nations national level population estimates. We calculated zonal statistics for ecoregions and hotspots to estimate percent change in population density as the difference between 1990 and 2015 population density divided by 1990 population density. We estimated population density change as the difference between 1990 and 2015 population density divided by the area of the zone of interest.

These realms account for approximately 70% of temperate grasslands. Relatively little change in precipitation was seen in the Neotropics (accounting for 20% of the biome, mainly in Argentina). In North America, in mixed agriculture and rangeland, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Kansas have experienced substantial drying, while further north in the Northern Prairie G200 region in Montana and North Dakota, which is mainly rangeland, there has been significant wetting. In the Palearctic the most substantial area of drying is in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, where livestock mortality among pastoralists has made news headlines in recent years. There has been a small amount of wetting in temperate grasslands in eastern Australia and New Zealand.

On the other hand, in the Neotropics, more than 15% of the biome has been drying, mainly in the Pantanal and northeastern Argentina; whereas the Orinoco wetlands in Venezuela, a G200 priority, have experienced drying. The Pantanal is the largest tropical wetland and both a Ramsar and UNESCO World Heritage site. There were some areas of wetting in the Florida Everglades, a G200 conservation priority. Some wetlands in the Caribbean Islands Hotspot have also gotten wetter. Although the IndoMalay accounts for a small portion of the biome, more than 90% of its Flooded Grasslands and Savannas have experienced wetting, all of it in the Ran of Kutch flooded grasslands, a mainly pastoral anthrome and G200 priority, in Gujarat, India. There has been little change in precipitation in flooded grasslands in the Palearctic, but some drying in the northeast corner of China.

Nearly 25% of mangroves have experienced wetting and population has increased more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170615.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Mangroves have seen a mix of wetting and drying in the Neotropics and Afrotropics, with wetting in Mexico, Caribbean Islands, Venezuela, and Colombia and drying in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This includes parts of the Amazon-Orinoco, Caribbean, and South America Pacific Mangroves G200 regions. Similarly, there has been wetting of mangroves in Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Nigeria and drying in Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Tanzania. This includes the East African mangroves G200 (Coastal forest of East Africa Hotspot). But there has mainly been wetting in Australasia and IndoMalay in India, Myanmar, Sumatra, and West Papua, overlapping in part with the Indo-Burma and Sundaland Hotspots. Population increase has been under 50% in IndoMalay (156 people/km<sup>2</sup>) and Neotropic (31 peopl/km<sup>2</sup>) realms but 100% (1 person/km<sup>2</sup>) in Australasia and 87% (94 people/km<sup>2</sup>) in the Afrotropics. Mangrove forests are extremely important for biodiversity and a multitude of ecosystem services including coastal protection and very high carbon storage [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].

High population growth and the continuing conversion and degradation of mangrove forests, as well as sea level rise, are greater threats to this biome than precipitation change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our dataset we found that globally there has been relatively little wetting and very little drying during the wettest three months over the past three decades that meet our criteria. While this is encouraging, there is nuance in where this wetting and drying has occurred. Furthermore, we used just one metric of changing climate, specifically a change in the wettest three months of the year at each location across the globe. That timing captures a critical period for the agricultural or general vegetation development at any given location, but may miss some meaningful changes in other parts of the year. For instance, some of the drying noted in the Greater Horn of Africa is not identified in annual trends because of increases in rainfall during the second season. Furthermore, our criteria for screening removed many locations where large changes in millimeters weren&#x02019;t large enough relative to the mean. This was done with agriculture in mind, but certainly other vegetation types may be adversely impacted by trends (large or small), that didn&#x02019;t pass through our screening process. Furthermore, we are examining historical precipitation trends that include both census-based and projected data. As such, these data may not necessarily be indicative of future trends in all areas.</p><p>Tropical ecosystems have been the source of most new agricultural lands in recent decades [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and are predicted to continue to face even greater pressures due to agricultural expansion. These tropical ecosystems harbor high proportions of global biodiversity and are conservation priorities according to most schemes. Simultaneously, they encompass a large proportion of developing nations and populations with high vulnerability and exposure to climate change and low adaptive capacity. While we found that tropical forests in Africa have not experienced a great deal of precipitation change in the last three decades, high rates of population increase are putting substantial pressure on these forests and threaten food security. African rural communities are predicted to be among the most vulnerable to climate changes [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Relatively small increases in population density but large increases in rate of change are likely to put great pressure on agroecosystems. Independent of climate change, agricultural expansion is expected to be greatest in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa, including both humid forests such as the Amazon and Congo Basins, and large areas of semi-arid land, such as the Cerrado, Pantanal, Miombo and Guinea savanna-woodlands [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although we did not find a great deal of significant wet season drying in the Amazon, the reports of Amazon die-back are hypothesized to be caused by drying during the dry season [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>Grasslands are important ecosystems that have already experienced a high degree of conversion already [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and are some of the most anthropogenically-impacted biomes in the world. Furthermore, Searchinger et al. [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] warn that conversion of African savannahs to cropland would likely be accompanied by high biodiversity and carbon costs. We found that grassland biomes have experienced both high population growth and substantial areas of wetting, which could convert grasslands to croplands via agricultural extensification. Similarly, areas that have undergone sustained drying over the last three decades could arguably experience further conversion of grasslands to croplands to, for example, make up for lowered productivity.</p><p>Based on Ellis and Ramankutty&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] anthromes, more than 70% of rangeland and rainfed agriculture in our dataset have experienced wet season wetting or drying over the last three decades. Increases in extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, and higher temperatures, may make rain fed agriculture and livestock forage unreliable. This could create a feedback in which people are forced to put increased pressure on ecosystems (e.g. additional land clearing to make up for low productivity, increased bushmeat consumption to meet basic needs, or intensified grazing). These pressures degrade ecosystems reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for them becomes most critical. Growing populations increase pressure on ecosystems as well. This creates a spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation. Furthermore, this type of deforestation and ecosystem degradation lessens the ability of lands to sequester carbon, and causes greenhouse gas emissions&#x02013;further contributing to climatic change.</p><p>Human demographic changes (e.g. population growth, age structure, urbanization) have important implications for global greenhouse gas emissions [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. While the rate of population increase (% change) is greatest in the Afrotropic realm, the increase in population density (people per km<sup>2</sup>) -because of very high starting population- in the Indo-malay and parts of the Australasian and Palearctic realms is substantially greater. Human population growth is both a primary driver of climate change and a key factor in climate change vulnerability and adaptation. More people use more resources, which causes more emissions. It has been estimated that if the unmet need for family planning were filled, by 2050 emissions could be reduced by 0.7&#x02013;1.25GtC/y, or approximately 8&#x02013;15% of what is needed to avoid warming of more than 2&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Simultaneously, population size impacts the ability of people (at the scale of families, communities, and nations) to adapt to climate change. For example, climate change is already challenging food production systems. Yet as populations continue to grow, more people need to be fed even in the face of climatic challenges to food production systems. Modeling of climate change and population growth in Ethiopia showed that under climate change, reducing population growth reduced the food security gap compared to high population growth both with and without climate change [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>However, the interaction between climate change, agriculture, and population growth with land cover change is complicated. While rural population growth causes direct pressure on natural resources for land and water, the relationship between human population and ecosystem degradation may be spatially decoupled. Ecosystem degradation in the form of demand for charcoal, agricultural products, and timber, often comes from urban centers or from a globalized market. For example, the global demand for palm oil, in everything from shampoo to crackers to biofuel, is responsible for significant deforestation throughout Southeast Asia, and increasingly in South America and Africa [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Much of this deforestation has occurred in biodiversity conservation priority areas such as Indonesia. Similarly, a great deal of African demand for charcoal, which is less efficient than fuel wood, comes from growing urban populations; this urban demand is a major driver of deforestation in many countries [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As another example, in the Brazilian Cerrado, agriculture threatens biodiversity independently from human population. This is largely due to the increase in mechanized agriculture and expansion of cattle ranching [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Furthermore, particularly when rural to rural migration at the forest frontier leads to repeated clearing of new lands during a lifetime&#x02013;often in relatively low population density areas&#x02014;the per capita impact on forests and biodiversity can be disproportionately high [<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170615.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Nevertheless, patterns of human population density and rate of increase remain good proxies for environmental impacts as well as for the spatial demands for agricultural products and ecosystem services.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Areas with high population growth and changing precipitation patterns, such as the horn of Africa, are vulnerable to environmental degradation and food insecurity. Healthy ecosystems are critical for maintaining livelihoods. The patterns we have found indicate areas where changes in precipitation and population increase could lead to ecosystem degradation and loss of ecosystem services. In addition, this analysis can be used to test hypotheses about the impacts of wetting and drying on agricultural extensification and habitat conversion by examining remote sensing data in similar areas that have experienced different types of precipitation change. Future research may usefully integrate finer scale population and climate variables and additional time periods of human socio-economic vulnerability data. While more research is needed to advance more carefully informed policy solutions, building on the growing literature in the area, our results reveal acute confluence of human population pressures to climate change in areas of high biodiversity priority, such as Eastern Africa, Himalaya, Western Ghats, and Sri Lanka, suggesting opportunities for economic, health, policy, and healthcare sectors to synergize targeted efforts towards ameliorating coupled human and planetary health and wellbeing in areas of high priority for both.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170615.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Summarized biome, hotspots, and G200 data.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170615.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank B.
