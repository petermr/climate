<p class="p">This study used historical botanical and environmental data to highlight the importance of land management in restoring boreal rich-fen vegetation in a changing climate. The changes detected here can therefore be interpreted with confidence, in contrast to multiple short-term studies that may fail to detect important trends [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Our results suggest that the effect of mowing is an important factor in determining vegetation composition at these rich fens in Central Norway. In the period between the initial survey and re-survey of these two rich fen study areas, concurrent climate change has occurred, with significant increases in temperature sums. Local environmental conditions differ markedly between regions, but play a secondary role. Vegetation change since the beginning of the experiment appears to be greater at the continental site than the oceanic, and in the mown than the unmown plots. However, although mowing prevents the encroachment of
