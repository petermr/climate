<p class="p">Future community composition of rich fen vegetation is likely to depend both on local management and on climate change. Without mowing, shrubs and graminoids, particularly

 <italic class="italic">caerulea</italic>, are increasingly likely to out-compete the specialist fen species that we are aiming to restore, particularly at oceanic sites where higher productivity induced by warmer temperatures could result in increasingly favourable conditions for

 <italic class="italic">caerulea</italic> growth. Although mowing re-sets the fen system to some extent, this may not be sufficient to ensure the persistence of specialist bryophyte species, especially in the face of climate change. Despite mowing not being effective in restoring all fen specialist species, particularly bryophytes, the potential of this type of management to mitigate against climate change impacts on fen vegetation, by removing increased plant biomass generated by extended growing seasons to create the more open conditions required by fen specialists, is considerable. Traditional management by mowing at least every second year should be continued, as abandoned fens lose habitat specialists and can lead to 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">caerulea</italic> encroachment, particularly in the margins and in oceanic areas. More intensive management measures such as annual mowing for shorter or longer periods may be required to restore fully the cover of fen bryophyte species. Mowing practices could be scaled up to be carried out in similar fens where abandonment has led to the loss of typical fen species. Hydrological “buffer zones” around fens should be implemented to protect the hydrology of the sites in view of continuing temperature increases. Finally, species and communities that are broadly distributed geographically are likely to vary in their responses to change due to regional and local differences in habitat heterogeneity; these differences must be accounted for when addressing the dual effects of land management and climate change.
