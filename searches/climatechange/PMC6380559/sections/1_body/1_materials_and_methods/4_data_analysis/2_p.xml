<p class="p">The change in the cover of shrubs, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">caerulea</italic>, specialist vascular plant species and specialist bryophytes was calculated for unmown and mown plots at each site. See 
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> (taken from [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]) for species designated as being moderately or extremely rich fen specialists. To estimate the effect of different plot size on the number of species per plot, the number of species were counted in plots of increasing size within a few of the localities, and species-area curves were drawn so that the appropriate values could be interpolated (Øien &amp; Moen, unpublished data). These change metrics were then used as response variables in a linear mixed effects model (
 <italic class="italic">lme</italic>), with mowing treatment and the interaction between mowing treatment and time between surveys (years) as fixed effects, and locality as a random effect, as the mown and unmown pairs are not independent of each other. The interaction between mowing treatment and time between surveys was included as there were differences in the length of the intersurvey period between plots. Further, we proceeded with one-way ANOVA (
 <italic class="italic">aov</italic>) and Tukey 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> tests (
 <italic class="italic">TukeyHSD</italic>) comparing the change metrics between the unmown and mown plots for each site type, i.e. two sites and two treatments.
