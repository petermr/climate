<p class="p">In the S3 scenario, a larger increase of air temperature at 2°C leads to further reduction of soil moisture, thus causing a decrease in the habitat index for 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. However, we find an increasing trend of malaria incidence under this scenario (Δ
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> ≈ 11%, Δ
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> ≈ 8%). The increase of malaria incidence found in S3 is attributed to the non-linear effects of air temperature on the life cycles of malaria vectors and parasites. In all scenarios, we find similar changing patterns in both exposed and infected cases in human population.
