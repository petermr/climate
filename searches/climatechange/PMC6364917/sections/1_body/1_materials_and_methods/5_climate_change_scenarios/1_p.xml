<p class="p">We run the SLIM model for current climate conditions and contrast with simulations performed under elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] and air temperature increases at different magnitudes. Firstly, reanalysis forcing data obtained from ECMWF with [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] set equal to 385 ppm is used to run the model (S0—baseline). The average ERA-Interim air temperature used in S0 is approximately 0.8 ± 0.1°C above the 1720-1800 pre-industrial level [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] is set equal to 550 ppm projected for 2050 in the region [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] but no change in air temperature is assumed for this scenario (S1). It is unlikely that S1 will happen in the future as elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] will be accompanied by air temperature increase. However, scenario S1 allows us to analyze independently the impacts of increasing only [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] on malaria dynamics. Finally, increase of air temperature at 1°C and 2°C compared to S1 is also considered along with [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] set equal to 550 ppm (scenarios S2 &amp; S3, respectively). These scenarios highlighted the joint effects of expected air temperature change from elevated [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] on malaria transmission dynamics. Summary of climate scenarios for model simulations are shown in
