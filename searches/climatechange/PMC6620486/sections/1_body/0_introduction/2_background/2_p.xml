<p class="p">Research suggests that health is the human dimension that will suffer most the consequences of climate change. The World Health Organization (WHO 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) identified health hazards emanating from climate change as death from thermal extremes and weather disasters, vector-borne diseases, higher incidence of food-related and waterborne infections, photochemical air pollutants and conflicts driven from depleted natural resources. Earlier, the IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) had summed that food, water, industry and settlements will be affected by climate change, consequently worsening the health status of millions of people by increasing deaths, disease and injury because of heatwaves, floods, storms, fires and droughts. The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) called for more evidence on localised partial perceptions and responses to climate change-induced hazards. It further commented that disaster prevention encounters difficulties where local knowledge, culture and beliefs are unexplored. Similarly, Lotz-Sisitka and Urguhart (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) reiterated the need for specific and localised knowledge and capacity needs on climate change. Most studies at local levels have concentrated on establishing the impact of climate change, adaptation and mitigation efforts as well as response to climate change impacts, thereby limiting evidence on community understanding of climate change-induced health hazards and their coping strategies (Munaku &amp; Percyslage 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). This is so despite the signalised importance of community knowledge regarding climate change (Maibach, Nisbet &amp; Weathers 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>).
