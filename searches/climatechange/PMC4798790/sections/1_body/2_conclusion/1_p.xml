<p class="p">Many of the controversial topics in the biological sciences represent some of the most challenging concepts for communication and education in the sciences. The utilization of a variety of teaching tools to cover these subjects effectively and the continued investigation of new teaching methodologies for the education of students of all ages will be necessary to improve the appreciation for and understanding of subjects to which there is popular opposition. With citizen science in particular, there also exists an additional beneficial outcome: the ability to generate large-scale, publishable data for studies that may exceed traditional limitations. As both scientists and educational researchers, we can expand the opportunities for engaging nonscientists in research in the hope of strengthening the appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population, the “students” of any age. In turn, this positive experience may create excitement for scientific topics and empathy for the preservation of our only habitat.</p>
