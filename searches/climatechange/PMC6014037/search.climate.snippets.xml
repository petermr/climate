  <result pre="et al. 2005), concerns about rural people’s ability to perceive" exact="climate" post="change impact is equally increasing. Maddison ( 2007) is"/>
  <result pre="that rural farmers may take time to realise that unusual" exact="weather" post="represents a permanent shift in the climate. Claas et"/>
