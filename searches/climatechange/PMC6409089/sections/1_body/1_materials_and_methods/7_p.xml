<p class="p">To predict whether suitability conditions of each species might potentially change in the future we projected the estimated ENMs to future climate scenarios (i.e., for the year 2070). We used the “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) RCP 2.6 and 8.5 climate scenarios that represent the most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, respectively. The RCPs are coherent with an ample range of probable changes in future human greenhouse gas emissions with the objective or representing their atmospheric concentrations. RCP 2.6 expects that global annual greenhouse gas emissions will reach the highest point between 2010 and 2020, and that they will descend substantially thereafter while the RCP 8.5 expects that emissions continue to rise during the 21st century (

In addition, two different general circulation models (GCMs) for each of these scenarios were used to obtain the geographic predictions. These GCMs were CCSM4 and MIROC-ESM. All future environmental layers were based on the WorldClim database version 1.4 (
