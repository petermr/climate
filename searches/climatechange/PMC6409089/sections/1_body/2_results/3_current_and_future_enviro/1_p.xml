<p class="p">Estimates of environmental resistance based on the prediction of current ecological niche models are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. The most important temperature and precipitation variables were assigned resistance costs ranging from zero (no resistance to movement) to 100 (strong barrier to movement). 
 <italic class="italic">B. trifoliolata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. aspera</italic> had the most elevated changes in environmental resistance under present and future climate scenarios with a predicted increase in environmental resistance that would lead to lower gene flow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The other species have a similar degree of environmental resistance under current and future climate scenarios (
