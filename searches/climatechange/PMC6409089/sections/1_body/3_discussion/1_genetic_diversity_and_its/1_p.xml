<p class="p">In plants, higher genetic diversity has been frequently found in zones that had a stable climate during glacial periods and for which post-glacial migration was identified (

Higher genetic diversity has been found as well in environments that fluctuate in time or space, in which different genotypes can be favored at different times or locations and shifting selection can support higher genetic variation in fitness, even when stabilizing selection is acting to reduce genetic variation (

In particular for the Chihuahuan Desert southern areas such like the Mezquital and the Tehuacán Valleys, have been proposed as areas of refugia for the biota of this warm desert because they were isolated during periods of glacial-interglacial cycles, with semi-arid climates and it has been discovered that a number of plants from these areas have high genetic diversity (
