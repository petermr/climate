<p class="p">In summary, this study shows that even shrubby species adapted to arid conditions will be affected by climate change; the five species will have suitable climate conditions for expanding their distribution to the west of the Chihuahuan Desert according to the future climate scenarios. However, for species with low ecological resistance, climate change can have the effect of allowing gene flow among populations. Based on suitability of habitat and haplotype diversity, we suggest preserving two hotspots of genetic diversity in the Sierra Madre Oriental, located in areas without protection.</p>
