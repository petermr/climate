<p id="Par54" class="p">We show model actual and model satellite-like-derived Chl-a relative to the OC-CCI-derived Chl-a product (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The model-derived Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) closely captures the actual Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), though slightly overestimates the equatorial Chl-a. Comparing the model derived Chl-a to the OC-CCI product (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), we find that the model captures the patterns of high and low Chl-a values between upwelling high latitude, equatorial and nutrient limited subtropical zones. The model has Chl-a too high relative to the OC-CCI product in high latitudes (sometimes by a factor of 2 or more), and there are some patches of the subtropical gyres that are too low. Regions of the equatorial Atlantic and Indian oceans are too high in the model. The region of high Chl-a in the equatorial Pacific is narrower in the model than the observations. Some additional regions of high productivity are not captured in the model, especially along coastlines where the model resolution is too coarse to capture the important coastal physics. The model also does not capture the polar regions well, either in the physics or sea-ice extent and we do not adequately parameterize sea-ice and sea-ice edge phytoplankton communities. The model also captures the patterns of interannual variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>), but does overestimate it in regions where it also overestimates the 18 year mean composite. Particularly noticeable is that the high variability in the equatorial Pacific is shifted relative to the observations, suggesting the physical manifestation of the El Nino/La Nina response is slightly misplaced in the Earth System Model (unsurprisingly given the too narrow upwelling band as seen in the Chl-a composite). The model also does a good job at capturing the patterns of the ratio of the interannual variability to the 18-year composite (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>), though overestimates in the Equatorial Pacific (where there is a mismatch in the physical manifestation of El Nino/La Nina), but otherwise has a low bias elsewhere. This latter is expected as we do not capture all the sources of variability (e.g. mesoscale features) found in the real ocean.
