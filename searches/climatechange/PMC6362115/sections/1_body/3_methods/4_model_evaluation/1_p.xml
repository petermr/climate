Composites are derived from all monthly means where there are satellite measurements. Thus for instance, high latitudes only have input for months where there is sufficient light and some equatorial regions miss months when there are too many clouds. Model composites are derived with the same missing months to match the observations. The model internal interannual variability does not match the real world (i.e. El Ninos do not occur in the same years), thus we compare interannual variability in terms of a temporal standard deviation of annual composites from 1998 to 2015 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). To evaluate the skill of the model, we compare to satellite observations, which constitute only an estimate of true Chl-a, and

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>–
