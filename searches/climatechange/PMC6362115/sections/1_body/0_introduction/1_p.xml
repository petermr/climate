<p id="Par3" class="p">Phytoplankton in the sunlit layer of the ocean are important both as the base of the marine food web, and so fuelling fisheries, and in regulating key biogeochemical processes such as export of carbon to the deep ocean. Satellite ocean colour measurements over the last two decades have allowed the scientific community an unprecedented dataset to study phytoplankton on a global scale and at regular, frequent intervals. Ocean colour satellite sensors measure the radiance at the top of atmosphere over a range of wavelengths. After taking account of the optically significant constituents in the atmosphere (which can include a substantial error)
