<p id="Par30" class="p">The metric of true colour, the hue angle, which is composed of the full visible reflectance spectra does not show a particularly strong signal of change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10f</xref>). Where some of the reflectance bands do not show a strong trend, they will dampen the signal of the change in true colour. While surface ocean colour harbours important information on the ocean ecological and biogeochemical response to climate change our results indicate that it is necessary to resolve blue-green bands (nominally 467–510 nm) to obtain the most sensitive indicator. This is not due to overall changes in Chl-a per se but rather due to combined changes in optical constituents, and particularly phytoplankton community structure.
