 </sup> to provide a value between 0° and 360°. Open ocean values range between green (~100°) where there is high productivity to blue (~230°) in the oligotrophic subtropical gyres (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). We find a change in the hue angle by up to 10° in some locations and a decrease of up to 5° in others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). We note that these are relatively small shifts, unlikely to be easily registered by eye. Increase in the hue angle can be interpreted as a shift to bluer water, while a decrease suggests greener water. In general, the pattern matches that of the change in Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>): bluer water where there are decreases in Chl-a and greener waters where Chl-a increases. These results can be understood by the changes seen in the blue

 <sub class="sub">RS</sub> (shown for 475 nm, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>), which increases in most regions where Chl-a decreases. Chl-a absorbs strongly in the blue, such that a larger amount of blue light is reflected when there is lower Chl-a. The reverse occurs for most regions where Chl-a increases: increased blue reflectance and greener colour. There is less impact of the changes in Chl-a in the green waveband (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). This strong impact of Chl-a concentrations on the blue reflectance, but less on the green, is used by many algorithms that determine Chl-a concentrations from space
