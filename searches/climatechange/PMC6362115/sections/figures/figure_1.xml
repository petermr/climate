   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>. Model actual Chl-a is the sum of the dynamic Chl-a for each phytoplankton type that is explicitly resolved in the model. It is equivalent to the Chl-a that would be measured in situ. This is distinct to satellite-derived Chl-a which is calculated via an algorithm derived from the reflected light measured by ocean colour satellite instruments
