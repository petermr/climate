<p class="p">Hence, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>, the main effect of Audience is based on the difference between the control condition (pure recall) and the retelling conditions. In the control condition, similarity to the OS is generally greater than in any of the retelling conditions, except among participants assigned to the hierarchism world view (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>); no differences emerged between the three different retelling conditions. In addition, though the pattern is not significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.08), we can see from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> that for any world view, similarity is greatest if the person with that world view retells his or her story to a listener with the same world view, which is opposite to Hypothesis 2.
