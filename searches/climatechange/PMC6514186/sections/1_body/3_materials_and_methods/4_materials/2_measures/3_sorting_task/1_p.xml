<p class="p">The sorting task aimed to provide a measurement of the cognitive structure of the story as mentally represented by the participant. The procedure closely followed that of 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones and Song (2014)</xref>. Participants saw a list of 30 terms that were related to the original story. Participants were asked to carefully read the list of terms and then to sort them into boxes so that terms that belonged together in the story were placed together in the same box. The sorting task was done on screen via drag and drop. Participants were free to group all or only some terms into boxes, and to choose how many boxes to use. From the sorting task, we created for each participant a symmetric co-occurrence matrix with 30 rows and 30 columns, representing the 30 terms, and a 1 in each cell 
 <italic class="italic">i, j</italic> if the terms i and j were placed together in the same box (otherwise 0). The aggregated co-occurrence matrix was used as an indicator of the relations among the key terms of the story as represented by the participants.
