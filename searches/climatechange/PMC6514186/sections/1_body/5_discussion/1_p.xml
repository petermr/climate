<p class="p">People’s evaluation of contentious social issues such as climate change is often only to a small degree influenced by their factual knowledge about these issues; cultural values and world views often play a stronger role in shaping such evaluations (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kahan et al., 2011</xref>). When people communicate about an issue, they tell and retell narratives that embody their beliefs as well as appraisals of the causes and evaluations of the consequences, conferring meaning to the issue (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown, 2017</xref>). One reason why these narratives and associated evaluations are so persistent and resist change might be due to memory processes which are at work during the communication process. Repeated telling and retelling of narratives can be expected to strengthen those aspects that are told and to weaken those aspects left out. Consequently, narratives may become more and more coherent and compatible with the person’s own core values and beliefs. Especially when conversing with like-minded people, a plausible assumption is that world views mutually reinforce each other and narratives are increasingly adjusted to these world views.
