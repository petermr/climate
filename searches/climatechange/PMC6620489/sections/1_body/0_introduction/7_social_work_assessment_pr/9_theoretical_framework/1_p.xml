<p class="p">The ecological systems theory was appropriate in assessing and describing the role of social work in the assessment of households affected by climate change.

This framework was applied to understand how social workers intervene in disasters in rural communities in addition to withstanding and dealing with climate-change-induced disasters. The ecological systems theory affirms that individuals are situated ‘within layers of systems from immediate family up to wider society’ and any assessment is required to take account of these layers of connections and influences (Coulshed &amp; Orme
