<p class="p">The study envisages providing clarifications on the role of social work in disaster management. This article argues that the role and involvement of social workers in climate-change-induced disasters is necessary (Jones &amp; Truell 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Social workers need to understand the social, cultural, economic, political and historical contexts of the locality in which the disaster occurred in order to intervene appropriately (Gray et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The research will contribute to the problem-solving knowledge of social work in intervening in communities affected by natural disasters. This will be in line with the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development’s commitment to work towards environmental sustainability in responding to the impacts of natural disasters by conducting research in social work in cooperation with communities (Jones &amp; Truell 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The research output will assist policy-makers, such as national DSD, in planning and assessment for future climate-change-induced disasters.
