<p id="Par8" class="p">We find that vigorous (moderate) warming increases global climate-exposed energy demand before adaptation around 2050 by 25–58% (11–27%), on top of the expansion due to socioeconomic development. We find broad agreement among ESMs that energy demand increases by more than 25% in the tropics and southern regions of the United States, Europe, and China. The number of low-income people exposed to increased energy needs varies greatly across SSPs.</p>
