 </sup>. The methods used by these models are fundamentally different from our econometric approach. IAMs provide simplified representations of human and natural systems and integrate the energy systems in the macroeconomic system. Our econometric elasticities do not capture large structural changes in the economy or changes in energy demand patterns over different stages of development. Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref> show a comparison between the range of IAM quantifications of the SSPs and our econometric method (red dots) for each sector, energy carrier combination for the years 2010 (Supplementary Fig.
