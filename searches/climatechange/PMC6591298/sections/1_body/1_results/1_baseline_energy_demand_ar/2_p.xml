<p id="Par10" class="p">Across SSP scenarios, global population around 2050 ranges between 8.4 and 10 billion people, with modestly varying geographic distribution that concentrates the bulk of future population change in northern mid-to-low latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). Per-capita GDP increases from 2010’s global average of $9763 to between 18,000 and $42,000, with geographic patterns of economic development differing by SSP—especially latitudinally (cf SSP4 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). Combining these spatial patterns with the income elasticities (specified by energy carrier, sector, and climatic zone) results in a northward-shifted and peaked latitudinal distribution of baseline future energy demand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c). Across SSPs, energy demand is more sensitive to income growth as compared to population expansion, with the largest energy demand increases occurring in the rapid economic growth SSP1 and SSP5 scenarios.
