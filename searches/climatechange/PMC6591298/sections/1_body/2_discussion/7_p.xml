<p id="Par26" class="p">Our work shows that it is possible to identify a globally comprehensive relationship between temperature and energy, and what the potential consequences would be in the light of climatic and socioeconomic uncertainties, but also shows that better data availability would greatly enhance this work. Strengthening the empirical basis for global-scale projections of energy impact thus necessitates fundamental advances in the data collection.</p>
