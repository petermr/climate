<p id="Par25" class="p">Notwithstanding these limitations, the demand for electricity that is a key driver of our projected impacts exhibits localized, high temporal frequency responses, whose shape can be well approximated by linear schedules outside of an intermediate moderate temperature range

 </sup>. We exploit this property to reconcile top–down and bottom-up estimates of the response of annual electricity demand to warming (see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Local conditional mean energy demand and the fraction of demand that is sensitive to variations in weather are crucial determinants of local impacts. However, these are not observed for the various fuel × sector combinations in grid cells across the world, and our projection methodology assumes that over the long run, all energy demand is responsive to temperature. This assumption likely overestimates the response of demand to warming, but lack of availability of local data makes it impossible to assess the magnitude and geographic distribution of the resulting bias. Our findings should thus be interpreted as worst-case projections of the impact of a given amount of warming, especially in tropical and subtropical regions that see large increases in extreme high-temperature days.
