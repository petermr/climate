  <p class="p">Permutation test of regional summed probability distributions, highlighting mid-Holocene asynchrony in the period 9 k – 3 k cal BP. Top: Tropical Highlands, the Northern Andes and Pacific Coast, Middle: Tropical Lowlands, Amazonia and circum-Amazonia, Bottom: Southern Cone, Southern Andes, Patagonia, and Pampas. Regional SPDs are compared against a 95% confidence envelope generated by randomly permuting the regional affiliation of each radiometric date (1000 runs). Significant deviations above (magenta) and below (cyan) the continental trend (95% confidence, grey) are asynchronous and frequently in antiphase between tropical South America and the Southern Cone.</p>
