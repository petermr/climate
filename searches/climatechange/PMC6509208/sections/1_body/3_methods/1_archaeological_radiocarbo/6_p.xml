 </sup>. Our initial results with this exploratory null model suggest statistically significant relative population decline during the Middle Holocene. Nonetheless, the initial formulation of the null hypothesis may be responsible for this finding (a Type I error) and thus we extend our model testing further to resolve this issue.
