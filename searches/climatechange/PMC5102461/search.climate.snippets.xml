  <result pre="Discussion In this paper, we quantified mammal local exposure to" exact="climate" post="change and identified areas in the Brazilian Amazon with"/>
  <result pre="actions, aiming to increase population resilience against negative effects of" exact="climate" post="change [ 23, 40]. However, exposure itself does not"/>
  <result pre="vulnerability. Although our results highlight a general pattern of local" exact="climate" post="exposure in the Amazon, the overall picture of species"/>
  <result pre="vulnerability depends ultimately on their sensibility and adaptability to new" exact="climate" post="conditions [ 4, 41, 42]. Studies have pointed out"/>
  <result pre="larger, exclusively diurnal or nocturne mammals are more sensitive to" exact="climate" post="change than smaller mammals and those with flexible activities"/>

  <result pre="geographically restricted and thereby expected to be more sensitive to" exact="climate" post="change [ 7, 17, 49]. In addition, these species"/>
  <result pre="these species will probably be unable to keep pace with" exact="climate" post="change even at relatively low magnitude of climate change"/>

  <result pre="We also found that the magnitude of species exposure to" exact="climate" post="change was uneven across the Brazilian Amazon territory. Species"/>
  <result pre="inhabiting south-western regions are likely to experience high magnitude of" exact="climate" post="change in the future. Although the number of critically-exposed"/>
