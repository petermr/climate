 <p class="p">Forecasting the impacts of climate change on 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>-borne viruses—especially dengue, chikungunya, and Zika—is a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3–34.0°C for 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>; 19.9–29.4°C for 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>), we can expect poleward shifts in 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>, but not by 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.
