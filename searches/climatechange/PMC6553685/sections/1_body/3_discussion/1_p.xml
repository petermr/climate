<p class="p">This study has shown how social processes can influence climate dynamics, according to one possible way of modelling social dynamics and norms. However, other frameworks for modelling human behaviour could yield different predictions. For instance, the socio-climate model of Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] does not include social learning. Individuals respond directly to changes in the climate, and not through interactions with one another. As a consequence, the rate at which individuals adopt mitigative strategies only varies with the current climate situation, and not with current population consensus. Mitigation efforts can therefore be expected to closely follow the severity of climate change in the model. In our model, social learning manifests as a feedback within the social system, resulting in qualitatively different socio-climate trajectories. Mitigative behaviour is initially suppressed–even as temperatures rise to levels that should incentivise mitigation–due to low numbers of mitigating individuals and therefore little turnover of behaviour in the population. However, social learning creates a positive feedback loop once there is a net positive utility to mitigate, and so as the numbers of mitigators increases, so too does the rate at which non-mitigators switch to being mitigators. This results in a sharp non-linear increase in mitigators, as a combined outcome of both the social and the climate system dynamics. We note that, all else being equal, adding social learning to a model has the effect of slowing down behaviour change in the human population (since a process takes time, by definition), and therefore the mitigation response of human populations.
