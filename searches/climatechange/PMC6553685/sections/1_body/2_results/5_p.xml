<p class="p">A sensitivity analysis reveals the relative influence of each parameter on the peak temperature anomaly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The time horizon of individuals’ temperature projection, social learning rate and costs of mitigation are major factors, all of which may be influenced by appropriate intervention. The importance of social parameter uncertainties in determining climate predictions indicated by our model has also been predicted by other socio-climate models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the system is relatively insensitive to the initial proportion of mitigators, suggesting that the mediation of social processes, as opposed to the current social state, is key to guiding the socio-climate system to a trajectory of reduced emissions. Sensitivity analyses such as these can help investigators determine priorities for data collection: the parameters exhibiting the greatest influence on predictions should be targeted for data collection so we can best reduce model uncertainty.
