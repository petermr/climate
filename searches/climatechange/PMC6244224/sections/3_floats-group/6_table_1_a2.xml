Since the climate affects how people’s emotions, it can also cause people to change their beliefs. If we unite we have better chance at solving climate problems and influencing the next generation’s attitudes towards nature. This is important since the climate influences the growth of crops and production of food, and we have to act now to prevent further changes to the climate’.</td>

Because of this, the climate is just a natural part of the world that we have to accept and it is not affected by people’s behaviour. Climate change is not related to the burning of fossil fuels, climate is just unpredictable. I’m open to changing my beliefs, but I think the best way of solving any possible environmental problems is by returning to the ways of our ancestors. Things were better when I was younger, and I think that today’s technology plays an important part in the changes we see. In others words, I don’t believe that there is anything wrong with the climate and I don’t think environmental problems are a sign that the world is ending’.</td>

    <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="td">‘The climate is determined by God and climate change is a sign that the world is ending. I will not change my belief and the climate influences neither me nor other people emotionally. The climate is not that complicated seeing as the changes are mainly related to the burning of fossil fuels. This means that we can also control the climate through technology, and that natural disasters are largely caused by people’s actions. The next generation will be influenced by our behaviour towards nature, but that doesn’t mean we should return to the ways of old. The climate was not better when I was younger, and I think young people can help the older generations get educated about climate change. This is important, since we have to act now to hinder further damage to the environment’.</td>

    <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="td">‘The climate plays an important part in our lives and we need to respect the environment. We have the right to know about climate issues that affect us directly and indirectly. Even though the climate is changing, it’s not caused by population growth and is not a sign that the world is ending. Sometimes I think that traditional healers can cause the climate to change, but I also believe that the changes in the climate are related to the burning of fossil fuels and people damaging the environment when they are trying to make money. This means that we should rather try to use sustainable technologies, since this would benefit the environment. It may not be possible for humans to control the climate through technology, but if we work together, we can make a difference’.</td>

    <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="td">‘There is something wrong with the environment, but returning to our old ways is not the way to solve problems. Seeing how the climate is both complicated and unpredictable, the government plays an important part in informing people about the changing and drafting laws as an effective way of protecting the environment. There is no way around the fact that the changes we see today are consequences of people’s behaviour, and if we continue the way we are now we will destroy the earth. However, it might be difficult to educate people about the problems because of their beliefs, but I for one am open to changing what I believe to be true’.</td>
