<p class="p">This framework relies on a normative framing of climate change and health in which distributional climate justice and reduced adverse health effects are desired outcomes of adaptation. Harriet Bulkeley et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] propose adding the notion of recognition to the concept of climate justice, which links socio-economic to cultural injustice [
 <xref rid="B6-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. This notion in turn applies the concept of climate justice to sub-national and local contexts as well. Likewise, the role of social and cultural determinants on human health has long been recognized in Public Health [
 <xref rid="B49-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and needs merely to be extended and reframed for the climate change era. The framework thus combines previous research on environmental justice and health determinants [
 <xref rid="B70-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] and links it with climate change aspects. Where the influence of social, environmental, and cultural determinants on human health is acknowledged, this framework helps link these influences to climate change adaptation. Justice can therefore be promoted through reduced health inequities with society overall, not only if linked directly to climate change adaptation. Climate justice has developed into an important movement that has much to offer to Public Health [
 <xref rid="B72-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Major requests posed by the climate justice community, such as increase participation of diverse population groups [
 <xref rid="B21-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], gender equality in representation [
 <xref rid="B73-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], financial support to those suffering most from adverse effects [
 <xref rid="B45-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], and procedural rights in the political climate change arena [
 <xref rid="B72-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], are chances to remain healthy as well [
 <xref rid="B74-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Learning from these movements can therefore support adaptation and health research and practice. Our proposed framework wishes to establish synergies between justice efforts and Public Health efforts.
