<p class="p">Can climate justice become a Public Health ethics issue for the anthropogenic climate change era? While the two have been linked, the role of justice in adaptation and specifically health-focused adaptation has rarely been discussed. This comes as a surprise, particularly in light of the long research tradition in Public Health focusing on the social, environmental, and cultural determinants of health. Climate change is fraught with ethical implications, such as vulnerability to increased weather extremes, fuel poverty, access to clean air, and safe housing. This theoretical framework acknowledges these connections and aims to provide a template to be filled with contextually appropriate variables in evaluation.</p>
