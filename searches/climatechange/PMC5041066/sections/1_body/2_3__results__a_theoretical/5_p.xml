<p class="p">In this framework, adaptation is positioned between climate change and the seven domains, and acts as a mediator of climate change effects on the determinants of health. At the same time, societal developments within each of these fields influence adaptation scope, design, implementation, and effects. The paths between adaptation and the seven domains are therefore the targets of evaluation in this framework: as a proxy for direct effects of climate change adaptation on health outcomes (which are difficult to measure), effects of adaptation on the seven domains can be assessed.</p>
