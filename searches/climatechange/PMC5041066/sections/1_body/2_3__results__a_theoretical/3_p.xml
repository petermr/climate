<p class="p">The aim of this proposed framework is to aid in assessing whether adaptation targets current inequities and determinants of health that may reduce unequally distributed health outcomes. To evaluate health-related climate change adaptation for its climate justice contribution, the theoretical framework draws from two main concepts: (i) health inequity [

 <xref rid="B52-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In more detail, these two concepts can be illustrated using seven domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="healthcare-04-00065-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), which illustrate variables and contents with which to measure possible climate justice advancement. Susan Cutter et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] describe six of these domains which are relevant to disaster resilience: social, economic, infrastructure, institutional, community, and environmental domains. As current research shows that culture can limit or facilitate “opportunities to become healthier” [
 <xref rid="B54-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], we propose adding culture as a further domain. Together, these seven domainns cover the range of likely determinants of human health potentially affected by climate change. They serve as the overarching evaluation frame.
