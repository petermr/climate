<p class="p">The underlying principle of the proposed framework is an adaptation strategy’s potential for climate justice that serves as proxy indicator for effectiveness in adaptation evaluation. Our definition of climate justice refers to distributional justice [
 <xref rid="B27-healthcare-04-00065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] of the burden of adverse health effects, closely linked to the concept of environmental justice in the Public Health context. Environmental justice is based on the notion that environmental hazards and exposures disproportionately affect people with lower socio-economic capital, people of color, people in lower income regions or city districts, children, and people with less political power [
