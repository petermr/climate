<p class="p">Exploring rural transport and climate change priorities is an area requiring further investigation. This study would be aimed at improving the understanding of climate change impacts and how they impact livelihoods (Nhemachena

At the same time, there will be a need to validate climate change models and response strategies through long-term environmental observation and research systems. There is also a need for in-depth studies that quantify the costs of climate-related impacts on transportation for planning and adaptation measures (DEA

There is also scope for joint publications through fostering collaboration among social, biological and physical sciences and recognising the role and opportunities for all sectors of society in contributing towards enhanced mitigation and adaptation of climate-related impacts on transportation. Although the study touched on aspects related to the need to improve transportation, climate change communication did not do this exhaustively.
