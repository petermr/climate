<p class="p">The effect of climate change will lead to roads and paths being flooded more frequently. This will impact mobility and accessibility to goods and services. Roads in flat areas are at great risk from simple flooding, and roads in mountainous areas are more at risk of damage from the actions of rapidly flowing water in the drains and in cross streams. Both see communities becoming cut off and journeys taking much longer. At the very least, this leads to problems in transporting crops to markets and delivering agricultural inputs to villages. It will also lead to fewer visits being made by clinic staff to all sections of the community and to increased absenteeism from school. Even the collection of safe drinking water and fuel wood can become more difficult.</p>
