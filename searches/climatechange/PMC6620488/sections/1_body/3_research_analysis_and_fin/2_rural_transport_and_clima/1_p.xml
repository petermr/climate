<p class="p">In rural areas, roads represent a lifeline for economic and agricultural livelihood, as well as a number of indirect benefits including access to healthcare, education, credit, political participation and more (Sayeg, Starkey &amp; Huizenga 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Roads may be sparse through geographic locations, making each road critical (every road matters and counts). Extreme events pose a costly hazard to roads in terms of degradation, necessary maintenance and potential decrease in lifespan because of climatic impacts. Climate change poses costly impacts in terms of maintenance, repairs and lost connectivity (Schweikert et al.
