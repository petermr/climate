<p id="Par24" class="p">The CESM is a state-of-the-art CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) climate model. The CESM community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM–LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM–LE realizations use a single model version (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5) at a resolution of 192 × 288 (1.25° × 0.94°) in latitudinal and longitudinal directions, respectively, and at 30 vertical levels. The core simulations “replay” approximately two centuries, years 1920–2100, under an external forcing that is historical

 </sup> afterward. The ensemble members have small differences in the initial conditions. In this study the first 35 members of CESM–LE have been used because the remaining 5 members show a small systematic difference from the others. For the utilized realizations the ensemble mean of the global mean surface temperature from 1990 to 2080 increases by about 3.5 °C. For the details of the CESM–LE project see ref.
