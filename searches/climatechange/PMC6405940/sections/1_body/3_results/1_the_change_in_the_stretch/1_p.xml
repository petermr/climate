 </sub> of the stretching rates for the latitude of 30 °N for JJA indicating the data of the whole ensemble of PlaSim and also highlighting one particular member for illustrative purposes (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and constant surface temperature (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> in Methods), and, therefore, they represent a stationary climate, while colors from blue to red illustrate the years of the doubling of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (years 50–150). When considering only a single member (dashed line) large fluctuations can be seen, and it is hard to decide whether any trend exists for years 30–49. At the same time, taking into account all of the members, it is clear that there is no trend in 
 <italic class="italic">h</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">λ</italic>,
  <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 </sub> for the years of the stationary climate (violet). For years 50–150, red circles exhibit smaller values than blue ones in general, and also the values along the dashed line become smaller on average, that is, a decrease in the stretching rate can be observed. Studying the time series of the remaining latitudes, we find regions where the existence of a trend cannot be determined by utilizing one single ensemble member, because the fluctuations among the years are also on the order of the assumed trends (see Section 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> in Supplementary information).
