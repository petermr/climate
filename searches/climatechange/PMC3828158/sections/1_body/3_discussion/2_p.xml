<p class="p">We showed that weather significantly influences dengue incidence in Mexico. However, all these relationships are highly nonlinear. Tmin
 <sub class="sub">1∶2</sub> has the biggest impact on dengue with almost zero risk below 5°C, a modest increased risk above this temperature, and a rapid increasing risk when average minimum temperatures rise above 18°C. The sharp increase in dengue incidence at minimum temperatures beyond 18°C provides a partial explanation for the strong seasonality observed in tropical provinces where seasonal variations in temperature are not greater than a few degrees 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Focks1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[39]</xref>. These effects are consistent with the biology of both the dengue vector and the dengue virus because rising temperatures shorten the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of the virus, as well as the development time and the gonotrophic cycle of the mosquito resulting in an increased likelihood of dengue transmission
