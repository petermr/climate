<p class="p">To represent land-use, we used ISIMIP2b simulations of current and future land-use associated with the relevant RCPs and GCMs based on the MAgPIE and REMIND-MAgPIE model (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Land-use change models accounted for climate impacts (e.g., on crop yields) and were driven with the same climate input as the SDMs. The ISIMIP land-use scenarios provide percentage cover of six different land-use types (urban areas, rainfed crop, irrigated crop, pastures, as well as rainfed and irrigated bioenergy crops) at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°. We averaged annual land-use data for each of the two different time periods (1995 and 2080), across the four GCMs, and combined irrigated and rainfed crop categories into a single crop category.
