  <title class="title">Scallop whole stock biomass from RCP8.5 (top panel) and RCP4.5 (bottom panel) under the highest management strategy (catch limits, variable reference points, and 10% area closure) with varying additive ocean acidification impacts: Decreased larval survival (L), reduced growth rates (L+G), and increased predation on small scallops (L+G+P).</title>
  <p class="p">Bold line illustrates the mean, and shaded area is the 95% confidence interval for 100 model runs with stochastic recruitment. The 2000–2012 period is hindcast with observed recruitment.</p>
