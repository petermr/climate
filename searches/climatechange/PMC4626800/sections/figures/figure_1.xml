   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Annual anomalies of remote sensing based global land ET estimates from 1982 to 2013 for the global land area (snow/ice covered areas excluded), global land air temperature and NDVI. The vertical brown dashed line indicates the June 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The grey area denotes the min-max ensemble range and provides a relative measure of uncertainty for the ET and NDVI due to differences between the third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) and University of Arizona Vegetation Index and Phenology lab (VIP) NDVI time series. Another data-driven global land ET estimate from a previous study

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>, is shown with vertical color shading, where red and blue shades denote respective positive (El Niño) and negative (La Niña) phases, and darker shades indicate greater MEI intensity. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Spatial pattern of global land ET trends from 1982 to 2013; areas with non-significant (
