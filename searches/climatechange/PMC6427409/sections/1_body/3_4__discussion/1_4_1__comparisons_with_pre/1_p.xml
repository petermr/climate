<p class="p">In this paper, the temporal and spatial distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in cold regions of Heilongjiang Province under historical and future conditions were studied. The high-latitude record of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields simulated by the DNDC model was refreshed. The dynamic process of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in this region was well simulated by the calibration and validation of the site experiment. Compared with previous studies, some similarities and differences exist. Zhang et al. [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] studied the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux dynamics of Sanjiang Plain in eastern Heilongjiang Province from 1990 to 2010 by the DNDC model. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes were more sensitive to temperature, soil clay content, and SOC, but less sensitive to rainfall, soil bulk density, and pH, which was consistent with the results of this study, but he did not carry out a sensitivity analysis on crop parameters. His research results showed that the average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were 71 kg C/ha, 137 kg C/ha, and 180 kg C/ha, respectively. In this study, the average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were 138 kg C/ha, 189 kg C/ha, and 199 kg C/ha, respectively, which were higher than the results of the previous study. The main reason may be due to the difference of the site experiment results for DNDC model validation. The average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux of the site experiment used in this study was larger than that of his study. Therefore, in regional simulation, the calibration and validation of the model has a greater effect on the simulation results. In future regional simulation, multi-site experiments should be carried out in order to calibrate and validate the model and thus increase the reliability of the simulation. The results from another paper of Zhang’s showed that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux from paddy fields in Sanjiang Plain is mostly concentrated in the range of 50 to 600 kg C/ha, which is larger than that in this study area. The main reason is that the soil database used in this study is different from that in this paper. The spatial distribution of simulation results is quite different when using grid data to construct regional simulation. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] pointed out that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under A1B and B1 scenarios in the three northeastern provinces from China (including, Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and Liaoning Province) would increase from 160 kg C/ha to 200 kg C/ha between 2010–2050, which is similar to the change of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 in this paper. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories recommended a CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> baseline emission factor of 1.3 kg CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>/ha/d for estimating CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in regions or countries [

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The growth period of rice in Heilongjiang Province is about 115 days, so the calculated CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes is 112.13 kg C/ha, which is less than the results of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes at all of the historical periods in this study. This is mainly because the SOC in the black soil in Heilongjiang Province is higher compared with other regions, which provided a greater carbon source for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. In this study, many ecological driving factors affecting greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields, such as climate, soil, and farmland management measures, were considered. Therefore, compared with the method recommended by the IPCC, the method adopted in this study has greatly improved the estimation of regional CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes. There are few studies of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province under future climate conditions. This study pointed out that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes and the climatic tendency of northern Heilongjiang Province under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 conditions were relatively small. With the increase of accumulated temperature in the study area under climate change, the appropriate development of rice cultivation in this area would have better CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission reduction advantages than other areas.
