<p id="Par83" class="p">Our results emphasize that not only climate change and adaptation appraisal affect the formation of agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance, but personal, farm and regional characteristics are also of importance as well. This finding supports conceptual and empirical literature proposing that adaptation is often a response to a mix of climatic and non-climatic factors (Berrang-Ford et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2008</xref>; Mitter et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2002</xref>). Farmers indicating that economic factors are of major relevance for decision-making and even more important than climatic factors, e.g. the cost-benefit calculators, can be interpreted in the context of the ‘finite pool of worry effect’ (Hansen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2004</xref>; Weber 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2010</xref>), which suggests that increased concern, e.g. about market development, may result in decreased concern about climate change. It may also be useful to follow the concept of ‘multi-purpose’ and ‘hidden adaptation’ (Grüneis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2016</xref>), when referring to measures that are mainly motivated by non-climatic factors but contribute to climate change adaptation as well. For instance and following the argumentation by the integrative adaptors, changes in crop rotations may result from the desire to support humus formation (environmental factor) but may positively affect crop production through changes in the growing period (climatic factor) as well.
