<p id="Par25" class="p">The face-to face interviews were carried out on the farms of the interviewees during the growing period in 2016. An interview guide with open-ended questions was designed (see SM 1) covering the concepts of the theoretical model introduced above. Open-ended questions were asked in order to encourage farmers to report more rather than less, to gain farmers’ personal information, and to elicit new phenomena and unexpected structures, as recommended by Lamnek

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2007</xref>. The interview guide supported the interviewer in tailoring the questions to the interviewees and in ensuring that all relevant aspects were covered. It was pre-tested with farmers who were not included in the original sample and slightly changed based on the received feedback. Each interview started with the introductory question: “
 <italic class="italic">To start with, would you please share your view on climate change?”</italic> with the intention of stimulating narration, and obtaining information on farmers’ belief in and attitude towards climate change. Further topical areas of the interview guide were (i) perceived and expected changes in climate conditions, (ii) perceived and expected climate change-related impacts, (iii) adaptation measures already implemented or planned to be implemented in the future, and (iv) factors stimulating or impairing the implementation of adaptation measures. The sequence of the questions and their particular wording were adjusted to the interview situation in order to keep up the ‘narrative line’ (Weller et al.
