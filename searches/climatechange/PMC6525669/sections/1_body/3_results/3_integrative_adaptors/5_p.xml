 <bold class="bold">Adaptation intention</bold> is expressed as continuation or expansion of environmental-friendly or organic production, which is perceived as the basis for taking advantage of new opportunities. However, the fundamental belief in the effectiveness of the chosen farming practices and production methods for climate change adaptation may lead to overconfidence and thus avoidance. Expressions of 
 <bold class="bold">avoidance</bold> can be interpreted as religious faith or denial (gallows humor) as illustrated by the following example:
 <disp-quote class="disp-quote">
  <p id="Par47" class="p">“We won’t be affected very much if temperature increases by two degrees or more. Unless all glaciers melt and the water comes and stays, as floodplain or as a lake for swimming. … In that case, we will build a wine tavern over there (laughs).” (M2)</p>
