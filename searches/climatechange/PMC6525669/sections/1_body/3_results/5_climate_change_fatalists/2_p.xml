<p id="Par63" class="p">Farmers forming part of this group perceive a higher frequency of extreme weather events, rapid changes in weather conditions (warm/cold, dry/wet), and warmer winters. They articulate strongly negative feelings about 
 <bold class="bold">changes in regional climate conditions and related impacts</bold> even though they report only individual years with lower yield levels, higher pest pressure, or aggravated workflows.
