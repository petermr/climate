<p id="Par14" class="p">The reviewed theories and models have been empirically tested, modified, or refined for the agricultural adaptation context at different locations. For instance, Roesch-McNally et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2017</xref> combine TRA and TPB with the ‘anatomy of adaptation’ suggested by Smit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2000</xref> to build a new conceptual framework for investigating adaptation intentions under a climate change scenario. They show that U.S. Corn Belt farmers intend to implement particular adaptation measures if they believe in their efficacy which farmers may learn from own experience or experience of their peers. Niles et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2016</xref> apply TPB in two farming regions in New Zealand and find that intended and actual implementation of adaptation measures are influenced by different factors. They highlight that climate change attitudes and beliefs are only related to intended but not to actual adaptation. Arunrat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2017</xref> use TPB and show that adaptation intention of farmers in a Thai region is mostly affected by perceived behavioural control factors, followed by attitude and subjective norm. Behavioural control is operationalized by assessing farmers’ self-confidence in adjusting current farming practices in the next three years, attitude refers to perceived importance and usefulness of adaptation, and subjective norm relates to perceived social pressure on adaptation behaviour. Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2006</xref> use TPB to examine farmers’ use of weather and climate forecasts in eastern Nebraska and the U.S. Corn Belt. Their results suggest that farmers perceive the usefulness of forecasts as rather low and depend on expert knowledge for a regular use.
