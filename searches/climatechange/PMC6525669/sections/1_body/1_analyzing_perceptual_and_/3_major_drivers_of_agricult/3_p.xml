 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref> base their investigation on PMT and find that Dutch farmers’ motivation to adapt to droughts can be explained to a significant extent by cognitive factors, i.e. perceived severity of potential consequences, perceived control efficacy, adaptation cost and self-efficacy. McClaran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref> use PMT to structure their analysis on livestock ranchers in the U.S. state of Arizona. Their findings suggest that the perceived efficacy of selected drought adaptation measures is positively related with implementation. Dang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2014</xref> draw on PMT to explore farmers’ perceived risks and adaptation intentions in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, and find that risk perception increases with belief in climate change, experienced impacts and lack of public adaptation programs. Building upon PMT, Truelove et al.
