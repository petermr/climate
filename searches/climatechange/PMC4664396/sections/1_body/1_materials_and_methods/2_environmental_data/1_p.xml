<p class="p">To develop the niche model, present environmental data and future predictions were downloaded from the Worldclim database website. For present (1950–2000) environmental data, a total of 19 bioclimatic layers were downloaded from Worldclim database version 1.4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] for three different future climate scenarios. These were Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5)—each of which is based on one of three different levels of radiative forcing. These RCPs were developed by three different institutes. RCP 8.5 is characterized by increased greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 21st century that lead to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time. This RCP assumes there are no policy changes to reduce emissions in the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0143724.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. RCP 6.0 is Intermediate emission scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized shortly after year 2100 by using range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. RCP 4.5 is a more optimistic scenario with emissions peak around 2040 and then decline [
