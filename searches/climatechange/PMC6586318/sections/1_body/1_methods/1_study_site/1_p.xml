<p class="p">Kanakaleonui Bird Corridor (KBC), which lies between 2,000 and 2,500 m asl on the east slope of Mauna Kea, Hawai‘i Island (19° 15’ 58” N, 155° 21’ 2” W), is a culturally important area in need of ecological restoration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218516.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). KBC experienced over 100 years of cattle grazing, feral pig activity and logging prior to fencing in 2007, and is now considered severely degraded. Although introduced herbivorous mammals have been removed, invasive pasture grasses such as 
 <italic class="italic">Cenchrus clandestinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Holcus lanatus</italic> continue to dominate the mountain parkland ecosystem. Appropriate high- and low-elevation sources for seeds of important native plant species were available from the adjacent Mauna Kea Forest Reserve (&gt;2,500 m asl) and Piha section of Hilo Forest Reserve (&lt;2,000 m asl). Microclimate monitoring and outplanting plots were selected along a 500 m elevation gradient each approximately 60 m apart in elevation within KBC. Plot locations were identified using a GIS and assessed to ensure they consisted of substrate similar to other plots, and relocated as necessary so that microclimate variables constituted the primary difference between sites. All plots lacked canopy cover. Rainfall ranged from 2,085 mm annually at the low-elevation boundary to 985 mm annually at the high-elevation boundary [
