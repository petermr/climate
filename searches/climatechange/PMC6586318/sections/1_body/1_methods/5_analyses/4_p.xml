<p class="p">Mixed effect models were used to account for variation due to microclimatic variables not captured by fixed effects. Plot was treated as a random effect and elevation was included as a fixed effect despite their correlation to explain additional variation in models. All data analyses were conducted in R 3.3.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We analyzed seedling survival using logistic regression models (generalized linear mixed models with logit link function) due to the binary nature of the data. Growth models were fitted using linear mixed effect models [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) due to unbalanced samples. We used AICc reverse stepwise model selection for both growth and survival models [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Fixed and random effects were evaluated using packages ‘sjstats’ and ‘sjPlot’ [
