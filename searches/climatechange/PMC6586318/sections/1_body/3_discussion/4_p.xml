<p class="p">The short-term nature of our experiment precluded meaningful findings about enhancing genetic enrichment to build resiliency in restoration strategies; however, limited as is was, it represents one of the few attempts to examine the effects of local climate adaptation within species’ current ranges while conducting restoration experiments in the presence of competition and disturbance from invasive species. Other studies have examined upper-elevation extension of species ranges by observation [
