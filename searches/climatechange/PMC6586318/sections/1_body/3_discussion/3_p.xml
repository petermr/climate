<p class="p">Larger-scale climate changes such as the trade wind inversion that limits upward movement of prevailing moisture-laden trade winds is an especially important influence of temperature and rainfall in montane environments of Hawai‘i [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Weather variability, warming, and rainfall patterns are affected within the inversion layer [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] found that the mean trade wind inversion strongly influenced species assemblages on Maui. The inversion layer on Hawai‘i Island has a diurnal base height range of 2,201–2,255 m, which included three of our study plots in the upper portion of KBC. Documented effects of increased number of trade wind inversion days, and their associated drier and warmer conditions have increased mortality and decreased recruitment of Haleakalā silverswords (
 <italic class="italic">Argyroxiphium sandwicense</italic> subsp. macrocephalum), particularly near range limits, over the last decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. There is evidence that the inversion layer has been decreasing in elevation, and the lifting condensation level is increasing, which may result in reduced cloud thickness, rainfall, and overall size of the rain-belt on mountain slopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. This shift could reduce the extent of wet and mesic forests at their upper-elevation limits, and favor drier mountain parkland communities. Restoration strategies may benefit from incorporating these future scenarios. Provenance trials within restoration plantings would be relatively simple to conduct and could determine if more drought- and exposure-tolerant variants are appropriate for these transition zones.
