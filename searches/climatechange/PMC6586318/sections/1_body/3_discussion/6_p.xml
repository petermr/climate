<p class="p">While overall high seedling survival rates during this study suggest that seedlings can survive in highly exposed conditions despite provenance, invasive species removal efforts were required to reduce competition. A suite of aggressive invasive plants such as matt-forming grasses and bull thistle (
 <italic class="italic">Cirsium vulgare</italic>), lack of native tree canopy, and herbivory by non-native birds presented formidable obstacles to conducting our experiment at KBC. Introduced pasture grasses present perhaps the most pervasive obstacle to restoration of many native ecosystems in Hawai‘i as in other locations [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] suggests that while climatic conditions of tropical montane forests will shift upward in elevation, the upslope movement is much less dramatic than previously reported; continued invasion and land use activities may remain the most significant obstacles to restoration success. Quantifying invasive plant regrowth for inclusion as a model predictor may provide understanding of competitive effects on survival and growth in similar future efforts.
