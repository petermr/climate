<p class="p">Our objective was to determine if important native Hawaiian montane plant species may benefit from enrichment with seeds from climatically appropriate sources to enhance survival, growth, and adaption to changing precipitation patterns by relocating conspecifics to more favorable climate regimes. Native montane species were largely absent from this mountain parkland system in need of restoration; we sought to identify local sources of each species from appropriate climate zones to increase tolerance to contemporary and future climate conditions, and connectivity between existing high-elevation subalpine woodlands and lower-elevation montane wet and mesic forests. Given the pattern of findings that plant species are moving upslope with warming temperatures, we hypothesized that plants from a lower-elevation forest ecotype would have higher rates of survival and growth compared to high-elevation forest conspecifics when grown in common plots along an elevation gradient. Alternatively, we sought to determine if seeds from a high-elevation forest ecotype would outperform those from a low-elevation origin due to more favorable precipitation conditions when planted along the same elevation gradient. In addition to climate, we also considered if distance from seed origin was related to plant survival and growth.</p>
