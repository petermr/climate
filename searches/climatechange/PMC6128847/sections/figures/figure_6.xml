   </sup>. The open circles are the average PCB concentration observed in SRKW and Chinook salmon and error bars are 95% CI. By normalizing the PCB concentrations to low lipid fractions observed in killer whales (i.e. lipid content = 9.6%) and Chinook salmons (i.e. lipid content = 0.87%), the concentrations of PCBs are amplified in these species as an indication of a bioamplification process.
