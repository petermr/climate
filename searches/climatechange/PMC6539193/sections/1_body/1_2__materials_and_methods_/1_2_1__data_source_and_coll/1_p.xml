<p class="p">Data were obtained from the China Meteorological Administration and Provincial Meteorological Administration, encompassing 759 national standard meteorological stations across China. Unfortunately, complete long-term monitoring soil temperature data were not available for every station. The quality of the soil temperature data was poorer and it was less complete compared to the air temperature data, especially in the 1950s. This was due to instrument malfunctions and changes in administration. Hence, we started our study from the 1960s.</p>
