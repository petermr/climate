<p class="p">An advisory committee provided guidance and expertise throughout the assessment process. This committee included members from Dominica’s Ministry of Health and Environment as well as international experts from PAHO/WHO, WMO, HC, and CIMH. The project team also included an international consultant who travelled twice to Dominica to collect data, participate in stakeholder engagement activities, analyze the data, and lead the development of the assessment report. Based on the advisory committee’s expert judgment, four priority health areas were identified for examination in the assessment—vector-borne diseases, waterborne and water-related diseases, foodborne diseases, and food security. Extreme weather events were not initially scoped into the V&amp;A due to time and resource constraints, although they were recognized as an important threat to human health. Tropical Storm Erika struck Dominica while the V&amp;A was being conducted; this resulted in the inclusion of a case study of Erika in the final assessment report.</p>
