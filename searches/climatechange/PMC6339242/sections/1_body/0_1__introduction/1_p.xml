 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Regional weather and climate changes, including increasing severity and frequency of extreme weather events (EWEs) and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, can lead to direct and indirect impacts on health and well-being through mediating factors such as social capital, age and gender, health status, demographics, and public health infrastructure. Health effects, including mental illness, malnutrition, allergies, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, injuries, respiratory diseases, and poisoning, arise from direct pathways of climate change effects, such as increasing severity and frequency of storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves, or indirect pathways through changes to water quality, air pollution, land use, and ecosystem changes (e.g., ocean health) [

These health impacts, particularly to those most vulnerable, can increase pressures on health systems, including damage to infrastructure and disruption of health services, thereby testing the resilience and capacity of the health system to withstand increased shocks and stresses [
