<p class="p">Here, we aim to quantify the shifts in the floristic composition of Amazonian tree communities, and test the hypothesis that recent climatic drying is already impacting the composition of Amazonian forests. The data set derives from 106 long‐term, tree inventory plots distributed across intact closed‐canopy moist forests in lowland Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru and Venezuela (Supporting Information Appendix

We analyse monitoring records from as early as 1985 onwards to as recently as 2015, deliberately excluding any possible influence of the 2015–2016 El Niño drought from our analysis. We investigate trends within the overall community composition, as well as among recruits, trees that died, and in the growth rate that occurred within each census interval (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). We analyse compositional shifts along these three trait axes, which we demonstrate to be independent: life‐history (using wood density as a proxy), potential size, and bioclimatic distribution (Supporting Information  
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Based on predictions from plant physiology supported by experimental studies, we expect increases in dry season duration or intensity to shift floristic composition towards dry‐affiliated and smaller‐statured genera with high wood density (McDowell &amp; Allen,
