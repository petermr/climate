<p class="p">Changes in biodiversity attributed to climate change have already been documented in a wide variety of ecosystems (e.g. Bowler et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), including in some tropical locations, but so far there is remarkably little evidence of widespread impacts of climate change on the composition of tropical ecosystems which harbour much of the planet's diversity (Duque, Stevenson, &amp; Feeley, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Van Der Sande et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In contrast, there is evidence for widespread changes in the structure (i.e. aboveground biomass) and dynamics (e.g. mortality and productivity) of old‐growth tropical forests. In many forests, apparently undisturbed by humans, both aboveground biomass and the rate of ecological processes such as growth and recruitment have increased (e.g. Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lewis, Lopez‐Gonzalez, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Phillips &amp; Gentry, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0094" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Qie et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), while in Amazonia increases in mortality have caused a recent weakening of the biomass carbon sink (Brienen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these structural and dynamic changes are also associated with concerted changes in the species richness and composition of Amazonian forests.
