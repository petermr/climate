<p class="p">Genus‐level trait data were missing for 6%, 9% and 0.04% of all stems for PS, WDA and WD, respectively. For these cases, the mean trait values from the family were used, following established conventions (Baker et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Flores &amp; Coomes, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and considering the phylogenetic conservatism of PS and WD for Amazonian trees (Coelho de Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). For the small proportion of individuals belonging to families for which no trait information was available, we used average trait values of the community in the same census was used. For those stems not identified to family level (3.9%), we applied the mean trait for all dicot individuals of the plot census during which the tree was recorded. Considering the low proportion of missing data the imputation technique is unlikely to strongly affect our results (Penone et al.,
