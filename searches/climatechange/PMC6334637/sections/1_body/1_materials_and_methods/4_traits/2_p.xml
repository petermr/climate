 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>); Water deficit affiliation (WDA; mm): derived from relative abundances across 513 inventory plots distributed along a large gradient of MCWD across the Western Neotropics (Esquivel‐Muelbert, Baker, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This metric quantifies the preferred dry season severity for each taxon and is calculated as the dry season severity (measured as MCWD) where a taxon occurs weighted by the taxon's relative abundance in each location (Esquivel‐Muelbert, Baker, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Taxa affiliated to dry conditions show the most negative values of WDA, while the most wet‐affiliated ones have values of WDA equal to zero; Wood density (WD; g/cm
