<p class="p">The diversity of Amazonian flora hinders us from performing consistent species‐level analyses as comprehensive trait data are still missing for the large majority of Amazonian tree species. Therefore, our analyses were performed at the genus level, and the mean trait value of the genus was assigned to each individual. Our approach is expected to be adequate to capture the actual functional shifts in Amazonia as it captures most of the trait variation of Amazonian trees, which is mostly accounted for at the family and genus level (see Baker et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although genus‐level analyses still miss some information on trait variation, analyses at this taxonomic resolution are also potentially more conservative with respect to the hypothesis of environmental‐driven floristic change than analyses at the species level, as they use mean genus‐level values instead of (more extreme) species‐level values. Results of analyses using species‐level traits, for those taxa where data are available, do not differ from genus‐level results (see Supporting Information Appendix
