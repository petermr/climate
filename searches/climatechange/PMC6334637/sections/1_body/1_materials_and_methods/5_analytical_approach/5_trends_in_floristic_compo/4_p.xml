<p class="p">Next, we investigated which genera contribute most to the significant functional changes that were detected. When trends in functional composition were significantly different from zero (see Section 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sec-0007" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2.4.1</xref> for details), we estimated Kendall's 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic> coefficient of correlation between Amazon‐wide slopes (calculated for the whole community, for recruits, and for losses) for each genus and their trait values (WDA, WD or PS). To ensure that abundance trends were estimated with reasonable levels of uncertainty, we restricted the investigation of the trends in abundance versus traits relationship to only include genera within the upper 20% quantile of abundance across the whole data set.
