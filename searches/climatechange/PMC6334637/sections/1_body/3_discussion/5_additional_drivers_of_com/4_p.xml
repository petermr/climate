<p class="p">There has been considerable concern regarding the ecosystem impacts of widespread removal of large‐bodied frugivores. In particular, it has been repeatedly suggested that hunting will or may have already altered tree composition in tropical forests (e.g. Doughty et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Peres, Emilio, Schietti, Desmoulière, &amp; Levi, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Peres &amp; Palacios, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Terborgh et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) via dispersal failure of zoochoric trees (Chapman &amp; Chapman, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). These tend to have high wood density and large stature, so a recruitment failure is predicted to lead to a reduction in the prevalence of both of these traits and thus in Amazonian biomass (Bello et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Peres et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This study was designed to understand floristic dynamics in intact Amazonian forests and not to evaluate the effects of hunting pressure, which is likely to more strongly affect areas adjacent to rural communities, roads and rivers (Peres &amp; Lake, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, the increase in potential size and the lack of change in wood density within the recruits (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) contradict expectations of the hunting hypothesis as a driver of recent community composition change in intact forests, which, again, does not rule out the possibility of hunting pressure causing shifts in composition in particular locations where this activity is stronger.
