<p class="p">The observed pace of change is a reflection of the nature of these communities. Recruitment and mortality of trees ≥10 cm D averaged nine trees per hectare per year between 1985 and 2010 across the basin (Brienen et al.,

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and mean plot‐monitoring length is 14 years, we can expect by the final census an accumulated turnover of ≈24% of stems. Thus, we should expect a priori that whole community‐level composition would not only be affected by changes over the measurement period but would also reflect legacy effects of recruitment and mortality processes occurring decades prior to the onset of the monitoring period (Davis, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Our results provide empirical evidence of the inertia within this system and clearly raise concerns about whether forests here will be able to track further climate change anticipated over coming decades.
