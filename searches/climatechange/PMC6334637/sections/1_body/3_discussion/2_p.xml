<p class="p">Here we report the first Amazon‐wide analyses of temporal trends in functional and floristic composition of lowland tree communities across 106 Amazonian inventory plots analysed over three decades. We find evidence of climate‐induced shifts in community compositional fluxes. Recruits have become more dry‐affiliated (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and the mortality of wet‐affiliated trees has increased in the areas where the drying trend was stronger (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), suggesting a direct effect of climate change on functional composition. This compositional shift is consistent with the detected intensification of the seasonal drought across the majority of permanent monitoring plots in Amazonia. The trends in potential size (PS) and wood density (WD) further indicate that changes within the Amazon forest are likely to be a consequence of a combination of drivers. However, our data also highlight the relative inertia of tropical forest communities in their ability to respond to environmental changes. For instance, the detected change in tree community fluxes, with recruits becoming more dry‐affiliated by 0.45 mm/year, is substantially smaller in magnitude than the actual climate trend of 1.1 mm/year.
