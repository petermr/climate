<p class="p">The forests analysed here have on average experienced a strengthening of the dry season, as measured by maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD). The plot‐level annual MCWD became more negative by on average 1.1 mm/year (95% CI = 1.4, 0.9) since 1985 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This represents a marked intensification in MCWD across our plots by on average 36% between 1985 and 2014. There are exceptions to the overall drying trend, with some plots near the Andes becoming wetter during this period (Figure
