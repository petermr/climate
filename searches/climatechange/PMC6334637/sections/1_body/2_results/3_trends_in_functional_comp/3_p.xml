<p class="p">For the recruits, dry‐affiliated genera have become more abundant, with water‐deficit affiliation (WDA) becoming significantly more negative for this segment of the community by 0.45 mm/year (CI 95% −0.9, −0.03 mm/year) or 0.3% per year (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). This trend was marginally significant across the basin when calculated using LMM (Figure
