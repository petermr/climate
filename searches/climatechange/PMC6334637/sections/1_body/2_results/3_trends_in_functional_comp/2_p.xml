<p class="p">Overall, there has been a significant increase in the potential size (PS) of tree communities: the community weighted mean (CWM) of PS when weighted by basal area increased by 0.03 cm/year (95% CI = 0.02, 0.05 cm/year) or 0.06% per year with basal gains increasing in PS by 0.06 cm/year (95% CI = 0.01, 0.12 cm/year) meaning that plots have been progressively occupied by larger statured genera (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The increase in basal area‐weighted community‐level PS holds regardless of the analytical technique, that is bootstrapped means or LMM (Table
