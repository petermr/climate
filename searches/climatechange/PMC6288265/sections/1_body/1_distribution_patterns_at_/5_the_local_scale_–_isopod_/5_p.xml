<p class="p">The crucial role of key habitats for isopod communities has been shown in detail by 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sfenthourakis and Triantis (2009)</xref> who identified freshwater-related habitats (riparian etc.) as the critical factor allowing for a significant representation of specialist species in Mediterranean island communities. A small core group of generalist species that forms the basis of such communities can be present even on very small dry islets, but the occurrence of freshwater-related habitats enriches insular communities with a wide range of mostly specialist species. In fact, the erratic distribution of such habitats especially on very small islets lies behind the Small Island Effect, at least for terrestrial isopods (
