<p class="p">If this pattern proves actually true and not an artefact of sampling or other biases, what would it imply for possible effects of predicted climate change on isopod distribution? On one hand, if regions around the Mediterranean become drier, thus more hostile to isopods, then we should expect a significant decrease in diversity, especially regarding locally adapted endemic forms. On the other hand, a plausible explanation for this diversity pattern could be provided by the high levels of habitat heterogeneity in Mediterranean countries, coupled with the semi-isolated and sparsely distributed favorable humid habitats, conditions that enhance allopatric differentiation hence evolutionary divergence of isopod populations. A further increase of such environmental heterogeneity through climate change might not be fatal for isopod diversity, then, but might even act as a trigger for further diversification. At the same time, positive effects could be expected for central and northern European regions, where increased rainfall and temperature might allow for range expansion of southern species, enriching diversity.</p>
