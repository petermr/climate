<p class="p">Furthermore, isopods do not seem to conform to Rapoport’s rule (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>), indicating that their distribution might not be controlled by competitive interactions, as found also in studies at local scales (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zimmer 2003</xref>). Of course, more detailed data on species occurrences and distribution ranges, especially from tropical regions, are desperately needed, before we can rigidly support any general conclusions. Nevertheless, the patterns exhibited by whole species-rich families, such as 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Armadillidiidae</named-content>
 </named-content> and 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Porcellionidae</named-content>
 </named-content>, whose global distribution is relatively well known, are highly indicative for such ‘deviating’ trends of isopods. These families are restricted in mid-latitudes and contribute to a large percentage of the global species richness, something that is not expected to change much even if groups of a more tropical ‘flavor’ (e.g., 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Philosciidae</named-content>
 </named-content>) prove to be much richer than it is known today.
