 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hornung et al. (2008)</xref> analysed distribution data from Transdanubia, the western part of Hungary that hosts the vast majority of Hungarian species, using UTM grids and recording altitude and habitat characteristics. The authors found species richness to decrease from undisturbed wet habitats to disturbed dry ones, as well as a relatively uniform richness pattern but with high compositional turnover among geographical regions and habitat characteristics. Degree of habitat degradation was identified as the main factor shaping the composition of isopod assemblages.
