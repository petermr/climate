<p class="p">It is surprising, then, that just a handful of researchers have addressed this issue. The first such study was made on Mt. Cameroon, by 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmalfuss and Ferrara (1982)</xref>, who found that isopod diversity sharply declines above the treeline. A few more studies were conducted on Greek mountains, namely by 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sfenthourakis (1992)</xref> on three mountains of continental Greece, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lymberakis et al. (2003)</xref> on mountains of Crete, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sfenthourakis et al. (2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) on mountains of Peloponnisos (southern Greece) and 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sfenthourakis et al. (2008)</xref> on five mountains of Greece. Most of these studies reported a general decrease of diversity with altitude (except in 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sfenthourakis et al., 2005</xref>), and generally similar patterns of species richness on most mountains. The most striking common finding, though, was that on the highest elevations, above the treeline, there is usually one species that dominates in population density reaching high values of total population size. The identity of this species on each mountain-top seems to be determined by historical factors: different species of

This effect might be partially due to ecological release, in the absence of lizard and/or several invertebrate predators that cannot tolerate alpine environments. Nevertheless, additional factors should be responsible, given that it is exhibited by only one species even though more species often occur at the same elevational zone, albeit in much lower population sizes. It is important to note that species confined to the alpine/sub-alpine zone are very rare, and most species occupy broader elevational ranges. In Greece, at least, the only species that may be confined to high elevations is

 </italic> Schmalfuss, Paragamian &amp; Sfenthourakis on Lefka Ori Mt. (Crete), but even for this species there is some evidence for occurrence at lower sites (Lymberakis, personal communication). Evidence for extensive endemism of mountainous isopods, as found in 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beron (1997)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmalfuss (2003)</xref>, may not contradict the former finding, since the latter authors do not report elevational ranges of the respective endemic species. Therefore, there might be many endemics on mountains, but these may occur at several altitudes, exploiting a variety of mountainous habitats.
