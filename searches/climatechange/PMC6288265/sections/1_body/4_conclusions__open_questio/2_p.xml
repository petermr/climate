<p class="p">As far as terrestrial isopods are concerned, we still need to gather more detailed data before we can provide reliable estimates of expected changes in distribution patterns. Based on available evidence, as presented in this paper, though, we may attempt some general tentative hypotheses. Most scenarios predict increased drought in circum-Mediterranean regions, which are assumed to become even more arid than today. Since the highest known species richness of isopods is found in this region, it is very probable that a significant part of isopod diversity, primarily those more dependent on humid habitats (such as riparian etc.), will be negatively affected. Such effects will be more extensive in insular assemblages where water availability is even more restricted. Given that Mediterranean islands host many endemic species, the expected problems will be also of qualitative importance. On the other hand, higher latitudes (and, also, altitudes) may experience an increase in isopod diversity, if species will be able to expand their distribution ranges following increasing annual temperatures. Nevertheless, in most regions that will not experience pronounced habitat alterations, we do not expect to see significant effects on isopod assemblages, given that these animals are not particularly sensitive to intermediate levels of disturbance.</p>
