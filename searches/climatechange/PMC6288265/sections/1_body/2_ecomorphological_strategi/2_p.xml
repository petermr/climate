 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schmalfuss (1984)</xref> identified five ‘ecomorphological strategies’, namely rollers (able to conglobate), clingers (broad and flat bodies, attaching to the substrate), runners (long legs and narrow bodies), creepers (short appendages, body with ornamentation) and spiny forms, plus ‘non-conformists’, for species not possible to be included in one of the other five, while 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hassall et al. (2006)</xref> added also ‘jumpers’ for one species of

 </italic> Collinge. These are actually ‘body plans’ presumably showing responses to special ecological roles, and described the general ecology of each. The former author provided also some restricted information on possible latitudinal trends in the relative contribution of each strategy to communities from different geographic regions (see Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). Even though in the strict sense of the terms we should probably refer to these plans simply as ‘baupläne’ (‘body plans’), we shall maintain the term here to conform to isopod literature. Generalisations regarding possible responses of different ecomorphs to environmental change cannot be easily made, given a certain degree of vagueness in the current description of ecomophological strategies. In fact, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dias et al. (2013)</xref> showed that activity budgets under different relative humidity conditions were mostly related to phylogenetic relatedness than to ecomorphological strategy, since species of 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Oniscidae</named-content>
 </named-content> following different such strategies were predicted to be more susceptible to desiccation than members of either 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Porcellionidae</named-content>
 </named-content> or 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">Amadillidiidae</named-content>. Members of 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Oniscidae</named-content>
 </named-content> lost mass most quickly and also suffered higher mortality in drier atmosphere. We can actually assume that ‘rollers’ should be better protected from desiccation under warm and dry conditions, but this strategy seems to be related mostly to defense against predators given that it is followed by both xeric species and very hygrophilous species (e.g., several endogean, riparian or humus-living 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name" class="named-content">
  <named-content content-type="family" class="named-content">Armadillidiidae</named-content>
 </named-content>). On the other hand, ‘creepers’ seem to exploit a more narrow range of habitats compared to all other ‘strategies’, being found almost exclusively in very humid micro-sites, such as the dense plant litter-layer, wet humus and/or in caves. Therefore, a possible dramatic decrease of humidity might have negative effects for ‘creepers’ at dry regions.
