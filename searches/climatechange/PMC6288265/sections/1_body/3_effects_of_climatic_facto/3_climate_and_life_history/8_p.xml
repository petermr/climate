<p class="p">A great number of studies prove that there is a general relationship between female size and clutch number. Stochastic environmental changes modify the actual results on different scales (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hornung and Warburg 1998</xref>) and species show significant phenotypic variation (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dangerfield and Hassall 1992</xref>). There is intra- and interspecific, annual, and geographic variations in timing and duration of reproduction in sympatric species as well (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zimmer and Brauckmann 1997</xref>). Individuals might postpone reproduction and/or decrease output by oosorption, converting energy back when faced with extreme conditions (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hornung and Warburg 1993</xref>, 1994). Females of equal size belonging to different species may carry very contrasting offspring numbers according to idiosyncratic life histories and reproductive strategies, or to phylogenetic effects.
