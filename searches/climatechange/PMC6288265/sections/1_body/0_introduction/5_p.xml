<p class="p">In the present paper we try to overview the current knowledge on isopod distribution at different scales, as well as related issues such as diversity gradients or their role in invasions, etc. We make an attempt to evaluate climate change effects on isopod diversity, especially in view of their tolerance to humidity and temperature. Nevertheless, we should stress from the start that, despite a relatively large literature on this group, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of their spatial patterns and the underlying processes. There are still many areas of the world that remain unexplored, especially in the tropics. Exact distributions remain poorly known, even in regions from where good species lists exist (with some exceptions, of course).</p>
