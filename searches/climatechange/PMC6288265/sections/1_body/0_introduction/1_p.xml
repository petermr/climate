<p class="p">The present global distribution of terrestrial isopods is the result of historical, palaeogeographical, palaeoecological, and evolutionary processes filtered through more recent effects of climatic (mostly temperature and precipitation regimes), topographic, edaphic, and biotic (mostly vegetation providing shelter and food, and controlling microclimate) factors at different scales. Currently, humans exert strong effects on all terrestrial biomes and biota, mainly through habitat fragmentation, elimination and/or change, urbanisation and pollution. At the same time, humans also provide new kinds of anthropogenic shelter sites, which often favour habitat generalists and result in faunal homogenisation.</p>
