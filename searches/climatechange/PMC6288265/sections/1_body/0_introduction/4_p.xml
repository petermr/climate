Such changes are expected to impact ecosystem structure and function, especially where water availability is the major limiting factor for soil organisms. Furthermore, climatic factors modify the quality and quantity of substrate upon which microbes, a main food source for woodlice, act, bringing about further consequences on soil quality and productivity (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kumar et al. 1992</xref>), keeping in mind also that the duration of dry periods between rainfalls is a more important determinant of organic matter decomposition than total precipitation (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cable et al. 2008</xref>). The microbial community is also dependent on the temperature regime, and may change accordingly. Soil temperature directly influences biomass, microbial activity, and community composition with potentially interactive effects on ecosystems’ carbon balance (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wall et al. 2012</xref>). The general consensus found is that a warmer climate will increase metabolic activity of microbes as well as the rate of litter decomposition (Kirschbaum 1995).
