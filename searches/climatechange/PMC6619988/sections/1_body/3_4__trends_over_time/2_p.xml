<p class="p">We have more data on the climate-change question, which was asked on the same POLES, northeast Oregon and North Country surveys, but also on other nationwide surveys in 2011, 2012 and 2014, along with 35 New Hampshire surveys 2010–2018.

 </bold> tracks these regional and national results. On climate change, New Hampshire public opinion is never far from national opinion, and might be viewed as a reasonable proxy. Hamilton et al. describe the older national surveys in more detail, and tracked New Hampshire results through spring of 2015.[

This graph also notes some major events that were widely proposed, at the time, to potentially shift public opinion on climate change. The most recent such events in this timeline are the disastrous US hurricane seasons of 2017 (Harvey, Irma and Maria) and 2018 (Florence and Michael). But these hurricane seasons, like the earlier events of Hurricane Sandy (2012), the IPCC 5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> report (2013), and Pope Francis’ encyclical on climate change (2015), produce no visible change. Together with science communication, however, such events might contribute to the cumulative rise.[
