 <xref rid="pone.0217608.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, confirm the upward drift of support for renewable energy and acceptance of ACC in both New Hampshire and Oregon data (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We also see odds ratios below 1.0 for 
 <italic class="italic">age</italic> across all four models (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). That is, older respondents in both New Hampshire and Oregon are less inclined to prioritize renewable energy, and also less inclined to believe that humans are changing the climate. (Note that 
 <italic class="italic">age</italic> is entered as a measurement variable—simply, age in years—for the models of 
 <xref rid="pone.0217608.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, although we grouped age for readability in the graphs.) The 
 <italic class="italic">year</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">age</italic> effects agree with simpler results visualized in Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g009" class="xref">9</xref>: clear ordering and wide separation of response preferences by 
 <italic class="italic">age regardless of trend</italic>, but also 
 <italic class="italic">upward trends regardless of age</italic>.
