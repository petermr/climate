 </bold> charts response to the climate-change question (
 <italic class="italic">climate</italic>) in parallel fashion. Again, only the most recent years of each project are shown; in New Hampshire the 
 <italic class="italic">climate</italic> question was asked more frequently than 
 <italic class="italic">renew</italic>, so we have more observations. US, New Hampshire and North Country results are quite similar: 64 to 67 percent agreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities. In contrast, fewer than half of the northeast Oregon respondents (48 percent) accept this consensus. The gap between northeast Oregon and US views on this item is 16 points (48 vs. 64), double what we saw on renewable energy. The Oregon respondents are comparatively more likely than nationwide or other regional respondents to think climate is changing mainly for natural reasons (38 percent) or even that it is not changing (6 percent), despite summer warming that has worsened the wildfires affecting their region.[
