 </bold> charts responses to renewable-energy (
 <italic class="italic">renew</italic>) responses from the most recent year of each project: 2016 for the US POLES survey, 2017 for North Country, or 2018 for northeast Oregon and New Hampshire. Large majorities of the respondents on each survey, between 64 and 82 percent, consider increased use of renewable energy to be a higher priority. The lowest number, 64 percent favoring renewable energy, represents northeast Oregon—politically a very conservative region, where 67 to 73 percent of the voters in each county supported Trump in 2016. Despite that region’s general conservativism, support for renewable energy is only 8 points lower in northeast Oregon than it is nationwide (64 versus 72).
