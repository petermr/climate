<p class="p">Although research objectives varied across projects, and to a lesser extent across stages within each project, many surveys carried two standard questions asking about renewable energy and climate change.

  <xref rid="pone.0217608.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>
 </bold> gives the wording of these 
 <italic class="italic">renew</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">climate</italic> questions, along with codes used for modeling later. The surveys asked also about respondent background characteristics, for the most part with identical wording. One exception is that the New Hampshire surveys asked respondents for their ideological identification, here coded from –2 (extremely or fairly liberal) to +2 (extremely or fairly conservative). The Oregon surveys recorded political party identification but not ideology, so our analysis employs a simple three-party scheme from –1 (Democrat) to +1 (Republican) with these data. Political and education variables are centered at zero for use with interaction terms later.
