<p class="p">In this paper we elaborate earlier analyses, drawing on new data (more than 3,000 additional interviews) that extend the Oregon and New Hampshire timelines through fall 2018. We also draw on a larger set of historical data from New Hampshire, so the total now exceeds 18,000 interviews for some analyses. Extended timelines broadly confirm earlier results, while enabling new analyses including tests for public-opinion impacts from the disastrous hurricane seasons of 2017 and 2018, detailed breakdowns that find similarities in the 2018 social profiles of renewable-energy and climate views in two different regions, comparisons of trend lines for different age groups across each issue and each region, and more precise estimates of interactions as well as distinct age and trend effects.</p>
