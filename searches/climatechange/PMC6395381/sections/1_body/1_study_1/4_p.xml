<p class="p">Finally, an ancillary objective was to compare two self-report scales measuring psychological distance from climate change: an extended version of the scale used by 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Spence et al. (2012)</xref>, and a scale used by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McDonald et al. (2013)</xref>. There is currently little consensus in the literature regarding how to measure psychological distance from climate change. Our goal was to establish the degree of correspondence between these two scales, and to determine which better predicts engagement with climate change. We also compared two scales measuring construal level, a commonly used measure called the Behavioral Identification Form (BIF), based on work by 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vallacher and Wegner (1989)</xref>, and a more quantitative method proposed by 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krüger et al. (2014)</xref>, based on Pettigrew’s Category Width measure (1958).
