<p class="p">As psychological distance and construal level have both been theorized to–and have been empirically shown to–affect one another (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Soderberg et al., 2015</xref>), it was expected that construal level might also predict willingness to undertake environmental actions. However, the results in this study indicate that construal level predicted engagement in the reverse direction, at least in the case of support for emission reduction policies. That is, those with a more abstract construal of the environment were more likely to support more expensive and more effective emission reduction policies, although this result was not statistically reliable.
