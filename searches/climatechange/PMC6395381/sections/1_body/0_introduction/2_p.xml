<p class="p">Research on this topic has been guided by the construal level theory of psychological distance (CLT; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trope and Liberman, 2010</xref>), according to which objects or events that are perceived as psychologically close tend to be construed in a “concrete” manner (yielding a specific representation of those objects or events), whereas objects or events that are perceived as psychologically distant tend to be construed in an “abstract” manner (yielding a broad representation of those objects or events). If people’s perceptions of distance from climate change are governed by a construal level process, then the level at which people construe climate change should be an important determinant of their support for climate action. For example, a concrete construal level may lead climate change to be perceived as psychologically close, which may result in greater acceptance of the problem and willingness to address it; conversely, an abstract construal level may lead climate change to be perceived as psychologically distant, which may result in lower acceptance of the problem and willingness to tackle it.
