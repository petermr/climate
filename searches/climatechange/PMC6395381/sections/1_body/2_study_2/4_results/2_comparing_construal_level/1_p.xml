<p class="p">Correlations between the environmental form of the BIF and psychological distance, the RCW, and other related variables are shown in 
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>. The BIF-E was positively correlated with behavioral control and ductile worldview, and negatively correlated with PD1, PD2, elastic worldview, and skepticism. The BIF-G showed weaker, but still significant correlations with some of these variables, but no relationship with skepticism, and PD2. The BIF-E and BIF-G were moderately correlated with one another, but notably, neither correlated with the RCW scales. As in Study 1, the RCW items showed no significant correlations with any variables besides themselves (PCA shown in
