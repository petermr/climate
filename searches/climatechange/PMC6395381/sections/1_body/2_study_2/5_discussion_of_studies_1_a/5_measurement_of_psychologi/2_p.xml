<p class="p">There is strong evidence to suggest that both PD scales measure the same underlying construct. Aside from possessing the same relationships with several criterion variables, both measures load primarily on one component. Further, PD1 and PD2 correlate highly with one another, as full scales and as separate dimensions. One difference is that PD1 (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Spence et al., 2012</xref>) appears slightly superior to PD2 (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McDonald et al., 2013</xref>) in its capacity to explain pro-environmental behavior, and it has consistently higher correlations with related variables. Length of scale is an important factor in these calculations, so we conducted an analysis using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula (a test of psychometric reliability that predicts reliability as it varies with scale length), which indicated that if PD2 had the same number of items as PD1, the discrepancy in reliability would disappear. However, the estimated correlations, after correction for attenuation, were still higher for PD1 (see

In its current form, the scale does not allow for the answer that climate change will affect all regions and people, regardless of closeness or distance from the self.
