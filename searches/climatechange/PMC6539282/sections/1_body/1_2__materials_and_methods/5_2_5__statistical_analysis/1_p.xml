<p class="p">This study adopted structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the structural relationship between attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, environmental concern, food neophobia and purchase intention, and model fit. The SEM is an effective model test and improvement method that enables theoretical models to be tested and can explain the causal relationships among the variables in hypotheses which are related to the models based on statistical dependence. The analysis used the SPSS version 21.0 statistical software package (IBM Corp.: New York, NY, USA) and Amos version 21.0 (IBM Corp.: New York, NY, USA).</p>
