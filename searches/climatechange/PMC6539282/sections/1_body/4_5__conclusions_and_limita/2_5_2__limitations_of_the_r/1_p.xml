<p class="p">In the context of global appeals for environmental issues, modern consumers are attentive to environmental, ecological, and sustainable development topics. However, insect foods are environmentally friendly and sustainable products, like organic foods and green products, and although relevant magazine articles have reported this fact, this has yet to be widely accepted by consumers. As such, it is recommended that future studies compare consumer attitudes towards different environmentally friendly products (e.g., organic foods and insect foods), including environmental awareness, behaviors, and values, and compare the variation among consumer knowledge. Additionally, it is recommended that future studies analyze the knowledge and perspectives of consumers belonging to various age groups or different cultural backgrounds (e.g., Thai and Indian consumers). One of the study’s main limitations is the use of a purposive sampling technique, which does not allow the findings to be generalized to the overall population of the customers’ attitudes toward insect food in Taiwan. Future research could also investigate the effect of other customer-related constructs, such as living in different regions, between urban and non-urban responses. In addition, the cost of purchasing insect foods is another future research limitation.</p>
