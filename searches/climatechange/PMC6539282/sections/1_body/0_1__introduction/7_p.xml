<p class="p">In summary, this study uses the TPB as a theoretical core for investigating the effects of consumer attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control on the willingness to purchase insect foods. It also adds the two elements of environmental concern and food neophobia. Through this, the study aims to provide an understanding of the likelihood of insects being used as food in Taiwan. In the event that the insect food-product industry develops, these results can serve as a reference for the development of marketing strategies.</p>
