<p class="p">Consumers’ perceived behavioral control is positively and significantly correlated with purchase intention (β = 0.564, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), thus supporting H3. This indicates that when a consumer believes they can easily obtain insect foods, their purchase intention will increase. According to TPB, perceived behavioral control influences customers’ intention and behavior because customers use perceived behavioral control to judge the likelihood of successfully performing the behavior or accomplishing the task [
 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Perceived control can increase as a result of a convenience channel to use, a channel which the customer is comfortable with or has experience using, or a channel which provides clear and transparent information about the process from purchase to delivery. If a channel provides a customer higher perceived control, then their purchase intention also increases [
 <xref rid="B92-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. On the other hand, the perceived difficulty of using a channel can result from obstacles and challenges in searching for products or interacting with the vendor, which can easily prevent the customer from making a purchase [
 <xref rid="B93-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. The results of this study are the same as those of previous literature, which state that consumers’ perceived behavioral control with regard to green skincare products positively and significantly affects their purchase intention [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>]. Perceived behavioral control is also an important factor in determining consumers’ intentions to purchase local pork products [
 <xref rid="B95-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>]. In other words, accessibility is an important factor related to purchasing products. With regard to environmental concern, this study reveals that it is not significantly correlated with purchase intention (β = 0.075, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and therefore, H4 is not supported. This indicates that consumers do not purchase insect foods as a result of environmental influences. The results of this study are consistent with those of Asif et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], who conclude that environmental concern does not significantly influence consumers’ intentions to purchase organic food products. However, Prakash and Pathak [
 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>] state that consumers’ environmental concern positively and significantly affects their intention to purchase products with environment-friendly packaging. This study postulates that although insect foods, organic foods, and products with environment-friendly packaging are helpful for the environment, conceptually, consumers do not consider insect foods as environment-friendly, and therefore environmental concern is not a factor influencing purchase intention. Furthermore, with regard to consumer perception of organic foods, consumers likely view such products from a health perspective and therefore, environmental concern is not included as an influencing factor.
