 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>). Maxent has the two following characteristics: (1) Maxent has good modelling performance using a small size of occurrence data and (2) Maxent can run using presence points only (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>). Many of the worst IPS are still in the process of expanding and can shift their climatic niche due to strong adaptation abilities (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bellard et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, there may be some modelling uncertainties on the prediction of IPS expansion. Although limitations may exist in the climatic suitability modelling approach due to climatic niche shifts, it is necessary to model climatic suitability of IPS under climate change. With the increasing trends of climatic suitability in the target ecoregion, IPS has a greater potential to expand into novel ecoregions (
