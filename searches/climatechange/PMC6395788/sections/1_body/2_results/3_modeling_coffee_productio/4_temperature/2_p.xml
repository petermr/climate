<p id="p0220" class="p">For temperature, the best agreement index between real and simulated data occurred for SH2 (d = 0.93), followed by the other treatments that presented d = 0.91. Analysing temperature residual error, the most expressive difference for average simulation (all simulations and treatments) occurred at 5–6 pm, 7 am, 10 am, and 3 pm. The third day of simulation had the best agreement index, ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 to the treatments. The most expressive error for the third simulation occurred at night (8–9 pm), when the model underestimated the values. The residual errors of temperature and relative humidity behaved inversely.</p>
