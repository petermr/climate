 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the Willmott agreement index between modelled and measured data, while 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> presents values of quantitative metrics MAD, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. The better agreements between simulated and measured data ranged from 0.66 to 0.98. The best one occurred in the third day of simulation for temperature and radiation, ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 for temperature, and 0.94 to 0.98 for radiation, which is considered a great performance. On the other hand, for radiation, SH3 had the best agreement (0.97).
