<p id="p0325" class="p">We concluded that the shaded schemes here with up to 30% of shading, reduced radiation, total temperature and wind speed. The systems reduced the wind speed up to 99%, working as a “wind break”. In the driest period of the year, humidity was superior on shaded-grown systems than in full-sun system. All these modifications may minimize the coffee stress in a different climate scenario, as proposed by IPCC. Along the period, the maximum temperature attenuation registered was 0.6 °C, but the temperature reduction was not significant in the blossoming period.</p>
