<p id="p0330" class="p">In this context, we discussed the importance of planning shade scheme before implementing them, because sometimes the shade scheme meteorological result is not the appropriate adaptation option to the study area. Analyzing current climate and the feedback that shading schemes may produce are important issues to implement an efficient management. It is relevant to emphasize that in order to decrease temperature, the best schemes are those with high tree density, which, even reducing production, bring other benefits such as stocking carbon, ecosystems services, high quality of coffee, and economic opportunities.</p>
