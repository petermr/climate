<p class="p">Furthermore, thermodynamic aspects of climate can be described by extensive quantities (e.g. heat content or ocean volume), which can be readily aggregated, and strong conclusions can be drawn from thermodynamic principles alone, often in terms of global budgets [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. By contrast, circulation aspects of climate are inherently regional, and involve dynamics (Newton's second law) as well as thermodynamics. Since dynamics is also inherently chaotic, the challenge of atmospheric circulation should come as no surprise.
