<p class="p">This paper has argued that the storyline approach to regional climate change information avoids the straightjacket that hampers the standard confidence-based approach, by allowing a reframing of the climate risk question from the prediction space into the decision space. While in principle such a reframing is possible from probabilistic estimates of risk, the challenge for regional climate change information is that the level of epistemic uncertainty is sufficiently high that subjective choices must inevitably be made, and the range of users sufficiently inhomogeneous that there is no consensus on values. Under such conditions, probabilistic ‘rational-choice’ approaches to decision-making are ineffective [
