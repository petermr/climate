 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, p. 210], Pearl invokes the following statement (attributed to G. Halter): ‘Probability is not really about numbers; it is about the structure of reasoning’. Making the subjective assumptions explicit leads to transparency in the subsequent analysis [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>, p. 1661] puts it, ‘Decision and policy makers are … far more interested in evidence than uncertainty’.
