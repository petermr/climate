<p class="p">The causal network depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref> incorporates two emergent aspects of climate change. Both aspects are simplifications, but they are extremely powerful and are widely used in the interpretation of climate information. The first is what is known as ‘pattern scaling’ [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]: namely that regional climate change is a function of global-mean warming. In practice, the patterns of regional warming are time dependent [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] so are different for transient and equilibrated warming levels, and short-lived climate forcers such as aerosol can have distinct regional effects [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Such additional degrees of freedom, as well as global tipping points, could be incorporated by making the node 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic> suitably multivariate. The second emergent aspect is the distinction between thermodynamic and dynamical aspects of regional climate change, which has already been discussed. While the distinction is not precise and has its limitations, it is useful (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]); it has even been used for the last two Dutch climate change scenarios [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. As with the other simplifications implicit in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>, e.g. the lack of any arrows pointing back from the right to the left, the validity of all these simplifications can be assessed 
 <italic class="italic">a posteriori</italic>.
