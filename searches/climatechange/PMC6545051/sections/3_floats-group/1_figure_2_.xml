  <p class="p">Projected average wintertime precipitation change (in mm d
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) over the Mediterranean basin plotted as a function of global warming level (in °C) relative to 1960–1990 and a ‘storyline index’ that represents the uncertainty in the pattern of circulation change in the region. The high-impact storyline corresponds to the combination of strong tropical upper tropospheric amplification of surface warming and a strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex, and the low-impact storyline to weak tropical upper tropospheric amplification of surface warming and a weakening of the polar vortex. The light blue dashed line represents a magnitude of change that is statistically detectable, and the dark blue dashed line corresponds to one standard deviation of the interannual variability. (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>) The standard representation of the difference between global warming levels of 1.5°C and 2.0°C is shown, taking the low- and high-impact storylines as spanning a range of uncertainty. (
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>) Differences are shown conditioned on different storylines. Adapted from [
