  <result pre="psychological distance between global severity and personal threat as regards" exact="climate" post="change. Our results demonstrate that having experienced climate-related disaster"/>

  <result pre="Thus, future studies that include both subjective risk perception of" exact="climate" post="change and objective measures should be conducted, and longitudinal"/>
