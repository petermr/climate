<p class="p">In the above analysis, accumulated capital allows for purchase and use of external inputs, such as dairy feed supplements. This can significantly impact poverty outcomes and environmental degradation, as external inputs such as energy and protein supplements in dairy production significantly influence methane emission risks that impact environmental sustainability. Higher productivity of the dairy herd from increased use of external inputs not only reduces poverty but also reduces methane emission per unit litre of milk produced.</p>
