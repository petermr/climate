<p class="p">The use of MS, different supplementation regimes and their effect on methane emissions can be used in exploring and extending sustainability concept to emission and mitigation of GHGs. In dairy production, energy and protein supplementation reduces methane emissions at herd level (Mills et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Thus, supplementation mitigates the negative externalities imposed through CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions and the resultant radiative forcing risks. However, the domino effect of price and production risks in smallholder agriculture with respect to GHG emissions has received little attention. This linkage could be important in the assessment of poverty–maladaptation–environmental degradation nexus.
