<p class="p">Disaster risk reduction is the development and application of policies, strategies and practices designed to minimise vulnerabilities and impacts of disasters through a combination of technical measures to reduce physical hazards and enhance social and economic capacity to adapt (UNISDR 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Disaster risk reduction is thus a cost-effective investment in preventing future losses and can be addressed within the context of sustainable development and poverty reduction by integrating risk considerations into policies, plans and programmes (UNISDR 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Risk reduction planning process involves the knowledge of situations, processes and systems. In dairy production, mitigation of GHG from feeding strategies reduces the vulnerability of livelihoods from enhanced disaster risks associated with methane emissions. However, methane emission risks in dairy cattle feeds adaptation have been accorded low attention.
