<p class="p">Livelihood refers to activities done by a farmer for earning a living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks (such as droughts) while maintaining or enhancing its capacities and assets and at the same time not undermining the natural resource base at local and global levels in the short and long-term (Chambers &amp; Conway 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>). Particular livelihood activities by the farmers reflect an explicit (or implicit) multidimensional objective function, including sociocultural and environmental outcomes (Carney 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). In the context of the above definition, livelihood for a dairy farmer would refer to the well-being of the farmer, in terms of production and sale of milk and milk products, food security, profit margin, survival of the animal asset, employment opportunities as well as contribution to farm productivity and environmental quality (Volenzo 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
