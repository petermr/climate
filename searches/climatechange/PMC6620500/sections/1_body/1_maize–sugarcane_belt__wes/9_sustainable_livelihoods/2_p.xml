<p class="p">Overall efficiency, resilience, adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of production systems can be inferred to and improved through its various components, such as soil nutrient management (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). At farm level, improved soil fertility management, integrated nutrient management, agroforestry and integrated livestock management lower the negative impacts of farming on natural resources and the environment (UNEP 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). In this article, sustainable adaptation to climate change is used to refer to management decisions and/or technical measures (newly adopted or intensification of the existing ones) that mitigate GHG emission risks. In a dairy enterprise, feed resources including the purchased components, their quality and availability are among the key determinants of enterprise profitability (Uddin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). This also has an impact on productivity and methane emission risks.
