<p class="p">Modelling and simulation can be used in the assessment of poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus. As simulated quantitative models offer a range of scenarios, they can be utilised in an iterative way to develop scenarios that project impacts within a coupled human–environment system (Turner et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). The worst-case scenario in the simulation model may be used in disaster planning (Downing &amp; Patwardhan

 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) was used in this study to simulate methane emissions from dairy cattle feeding strategies by resource-constrained farmers.
