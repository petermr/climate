<p id="Par9" class="p">Across the study area, 1.00–2.00 m of SLR is projected to permanently inundate 670–990 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of land (flood potential/uncertainty range = 430–1,220 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), and an additional 15–19% of land would be flooded during a 100-year storm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, for the 0.25 m and 0.50 m SLR scenarios, 48% and 32% more land, respectively, would be projected to flood during the 20-year storm compared to that inundated solely by SLR. During the 100-year storm, 77% and 41% more land would be flooded compared to SLR alone. Based on current SLR trajectories and the latest regional SLR projections for California, intermediate scenarios suggest 0.25 m and 0.50 m of SLR may be reached by the 2040 s and 2060 s, respectively
