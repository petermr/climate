<p id="Par7" class="p">Active tectonics have produced a high-relief coastline dominated by coastal bluffs in many locations across California, providing a buffer to SLR flooding not common on passive margin settings like the U.S. East Coast. However, millions of California residents live in or immediately adjacent to low-lying coastal areas and urbanized estuaries, within several meters of present-day sea level. Along the entire study area for the open coast of California, predicted 100-year storm-driven total water levels (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) under present-day conditions average 4.0 m ± 2.8 m (2 standard deviation range, 95%) above MSL (maximum value = 12.6 m). Within the largest estuary, San Francisco Bay, in which waves are much smaller than the open coast, the 100-year water levels average 1.8 m ± 0.8 m (maximum 3.4 m) above MSL. These vulnerable coastal settings often contain important infrastructure, such as airports and ports, which are shown here to be vulnerable to future SLR and extreme storm conditions (Fig.
