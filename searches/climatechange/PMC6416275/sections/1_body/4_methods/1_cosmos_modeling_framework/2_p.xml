 </sup>. A total water level time-series with three-hour resolution were first computed at thousands of individual points along the coast every ~100 meters by assuming a linear superposition (simple adding, not accounting for non-linear interactions) of the primary storm-driven water levels at the shore, i.e. storm surge, sea level anomalies, and wave-run-up. Empirical models were used to estimate storm surge, sea level, and wave runup levels

 </sup>. Annual, 20-year, and 100-year return period storms were then identified from each of the 100-year long total water level time-series spanning the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century by identifying peak events at least 3 days apart and ranking these events. Space and time-varying swell waves (from the WWIII model) and downscaled atmospheric wind and pressure fields associated with each identified storm event were then used as boundary conditions to drive the full CoSMoS model system and simulate individual storms.
