<p id="Par13" class="p">For the vast majority of the urbanized coast of California, the inclusion of storms in coastal flooding projections – in combination with the range of SLR expected by 2100 (i.e. 0.50 to 2.00 m) – increases population and property exposure from 16% for the annual storm to 57% for the 100-year storm compared to the no-storm scenarios (i.e. average daily conditions, including tides, waves and long-term coastal change) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). More than 600,000 people and $150 billion (2010 dollars) are at risk for the 2.00 m SLR + 100-year storm scenario. When factoring in coastal population trends

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup> this extreme scenario could equate to over 3 million residents at risk across the state by 2100. Excluding speculation about future population trends, these projected flood impacts represent 1.6% of the current California population and 6.3% of the state’s GDP, despite only directly affecting 0.3% of the state’s land area. This reflects the disproportionate density of the coastal population (5 times higher) and concentration of coastal property value (20 times higher). However, this example only estimates exposure from a single extreme, 100-year storm: under the same SLR scenario of 2.00 m, the recurring annual storm, which is more relevant to emergency response planning, is estimated to expose 483,000 residents (based on 2010 census data) and $119 billion (2010 dollars) in property by 2100. The economic impacts of projected future coastal flooding in California are of the same order of magnitude as estimates (all in 2010 dollars) from two of the costliest recent natural disasters in the world, the Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami ($325 billion)

 </sup>. This comparison suggests to policy makers that future coastal flooding due to storms and sea level rise must be considered an economic threat on par with the state’s and world’s most costly historical natural disasters.
