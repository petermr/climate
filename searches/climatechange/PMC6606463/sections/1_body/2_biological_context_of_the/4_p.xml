<p class="p">Finally, while lethal or critical thermal limits may be used to describe an organism's thermal sensitivity; these metrics, by definition, represent the endpoints of a species' thermal niche and generally exceed temperatures at which other important biological processes are affected. Physiological performance typically increases from a lower thermal limit to optimal temperatures, before decaying rapidly toward an upper thermal limit. Declining performance beyond optimal temperatures can have important ecological implications for population-level viability [

Moreover, different biological processes can have their own thermal niche, nested within the broader thermal range described by lethal limits. Reproduction, for example, may have a lower thermal performance window than adult growth [

Identifying the thermal range of biological processes that are limiting to individual fitness and population persistence will be necessary in order to refine estimates of thermal sensitivity and enhance our ability to forecast the vulnerability of different populations to ocean warming and extreme climatic events.
