<p class="p">Local adaptation can also occur despite high levels of gene flow, or at small spatial scales within a species dispersal kernel. Microgeographical adaptation can arise through several mechanisms where selection exceeds the homogenizing effect of gene flow [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] and may be particularly relevant along steep climatic gradients or depth gradients or among proximate locations with very different climatic regimes where selection pressure on resident populations may be high and lead to variation in thermal profiles, despite close geographical proximity. For instance, the seagrass 
 <italic class="italic">Posidonia oceanica</italic>, growing from near-surface to about 40 m depth in the Mediterranean, may experience maximum seasonal temperature differing by 10°C across the depth range, but similar minimum temperatures, experienced at the time of winter convective mixing [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Hence, local adaptation in this case may occur within horizontal spatial scales of hundreds of metres, and propagules from more thermally resistant genotypes in shallow waters may provide added thermal resistance to the population in deeper waters with long-term warming. Species with high dispersal will have a better capacity to infill and recover from localized disturbance events with thermally resistant genotypes from warmer regions more readily than species with poor dispersal capabilities [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Infilling rates could have important implications on levels of population fragmentation, localized extinctions and community stability in the face of warming, particularly for species with high rates of local adaptation in central and marginal populations [
