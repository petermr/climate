<p class="p">The complex interactions between an individual's thermal physiology and the environment mean that accurately predicting sensitivity to climate change presents significant challenges, particularly when extrapolating from local to global scales or from short-term experiments to long-term warming, and even more so when considering the diversity of life on Earth. Here we identify that, within any given community, thermal sensitivity may occur across a spectrum, ranging from organisms with highly conserved thermal niches, to others with locally adapted thermal niches. We identify that while this spectrum is implicit within the existing literature, a stark contrast in thermal sensitivity can result from having a conserved versus a locally adapted thermal niche, which is seldom recognized. Indeed, the wedge of potential thermal sensitivity helps to explain already observed patterns of population extirpation from thermal anomalies that would not have been predicted by the thermal distribution of the species alone [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Organisms with a conserved thermal niche display the lowest sensitivity to warming, particularly within central to cool-edge populations of a species' geographical range, where locally adapted individuals may display comparatively higher sensitivity. Including within-species variation in thermal physiology into climate change vulnerability predictions will require recognizing the nuanced spatial mosaics in climate heterogeneity at local and regional scales which may influence the sensitivity of locally adapted organisms, particularly in coastal marine systems. Moreover, it will require careful consideration of the temporal scale of impacts being examined and it may be necessary to move beyond a focus on critical and lethal limits 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>, and instead identify the thermal niche of processes that best reflect long-term population viability. Recognizing the diversity of biotic responses to warming will enable us to identify hotspots and safe-spots of climate change vulnerability and better allocate resources to respond to impending impacts.
