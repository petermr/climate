<p class="p">To examine whether empirically derived TSMs do indeed form a wedge with respect to thermal range position, upper TSMs of marine organisms were quantified using GlobTherm, a global database of species' upper thermal limits [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. To characterize the variability in upper TSM of marine organisms, we compared the mean upper thermal limit of experimental individuals from 265 marine taxa with the relative range position and local climatology of the studied organisms (methods described in electronic supplementary material).
