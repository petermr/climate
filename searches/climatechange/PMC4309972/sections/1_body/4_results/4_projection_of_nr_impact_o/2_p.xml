<p class="p">The detailed comparisons between SRES and RCP scenarios are showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. All RCP scenarios on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis show a net warming effect, in contrary to our improvement scenario. However, the advantage of our improvement scenario diminishes with time. On a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (379.4 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) nearly approaches that of the lowest RCP scenario (RCP2.6, 356.4 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e), or even in 2050 (613.6 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) surpasses that of the highest RCP scenario (RCP8.5, 499.6 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e). The warming effect of our abatement scenario on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis is lower than that of the RCP8.5 in 2020 and 2050. However, on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (452.3 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) and in 2050 (646.1 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e) become higher than that of RCP8.5 (423.5 and 499.6 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e in 2020 and 2050, respectively). The comparison results between SRES and RCP indicate that, (i) our reported SRES scenarios reveal the obvious mitigation potential on climate change but only on a short timescale not on a long timescale. (ii) the objectives of our scenarios in 2020 (i.e. realizing the total quantity control for NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and improving the N use efficiency with 20%) is well-targeted to the concentration levels of RCP. However, the objectives in 2050 are too cautious to meet the emission under the RCP scenarios. More aggressive target should be made for the year of 2050.
