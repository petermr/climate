<p class="p">The different gaseous Nr species show the different increase rates during 2000–2005 in China, with 11.4%, 44.0% and 8.3% for N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> and NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The emission sectors of Nr also show large variations. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is the only form of Nr that has unambiguous global implications through the strong warming effect on climate (E1). Total anthropogenic N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions in China for 2005 were estimated at 1.04–1.22 Tg N. The primary source of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O is agriculture. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils (including emissions from applied fertilizer, manure and crop residues) amounted to a total of 0.59–0.87 Tg N, it can be further categorized as either direct (0.40–0.59 Tg) or indirect (0.19–0.28 Tg) emissions. Direct emissions are caused by N applied to the soils, while indirect emissions are related to subsequent processes after Nr emissions and re-deposition, or after leaching and runoff. Animal manure, including emissions from manure management and grazing animals, contributed 0.17–0.18 Tg N to the atmosphere. The emission factors for direct and indirect N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions from agriculture in China were 1.87% and 0.66%, a little higher than the global mean values of 1.48% and 0.42%, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. In addition, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O from fuel combustion, industrial production, waste disposal and biomass burning delivered only 0.14–0.30 Tg N to the atmosphere. As a result, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O exerts a strong warming effect at 345 ± 19 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">20</sub> basis, then transforms to 311 ± 17 Tg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>e on a GTP
 <sub class="sub">100</sub> basis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S7</xref>). The close climate impacts on both timescales imply lasting effects on the climate system resulting from N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O due to its long atmospheric lifetime of around 120 years.
