 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S4</xref>). Through the application of ARCGIS 10, an explicit spatial map of N deposition rate around China was developed using the spatial interpolation technique (kriging). The deposition to each land cover type is obtained by overlapping with the nationwide land-use distribution map. In addition, the fertilization of cropland was adopted from the results of Cui
