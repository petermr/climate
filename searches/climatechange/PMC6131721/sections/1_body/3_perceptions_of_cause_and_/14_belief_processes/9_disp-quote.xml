 <p class="p">‘As African, yeah, we have rituals … you have to burn wood for cooking or doing whatever you have to do … so there’s a lot of smoke. When comes to the fact that you have to tell a person that you know what you’re doing is not good for the environment so what and so forth, that person will not be convinced by what you’re telling them … they’ll raise the fact that, no you seem like to be forgetting that I’m an African. I’m not westernised or something.’ (05-SS-Jouberton)</p>
