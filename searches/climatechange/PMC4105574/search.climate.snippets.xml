  <result pre="enabling initiatives, belief in technological salvation, and the perception that" exact="climate" post="change is a distant threat. In particular, this last"/>
  <result pre="has also been shown to be associated with both lower" exact="climate" post="change concern and diminished willingness to reduce energy use"/>
  <result pre="when people experience psychological distance, it negatively affects both their" exact="climate" post="change concern and their willingness to take action. The"/>
  <result pre="action. The strength of those feelings of psychological distance from" exact="climate" post="change may be influenced by people's perceptions and beliefs"/>
  <result pre="to hazards [24]– [28]. For example, the perception of increased" exact="climate" post="change risk to the self and family is linked"/>
