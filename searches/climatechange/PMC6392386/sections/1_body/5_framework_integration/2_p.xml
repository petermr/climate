<p class="p">Development of forest management strategies aimed at increasing or preserving wildlife species in a changing climate requires modeling efforts that include the coupled response of vegetation 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> wildlife to climate change. We suggested woodpeckers as indicator species of forest resiliency and biodiversity in an integrated forest–wildlife modeling framework, because they are ecologically constrained by forest structure, composition, and processes, which also affect a diversity of other organisms. Based on our comparison of predicted and observed woodpecker responses to climate change, we propose a framework for integration of climate, woodpecker, and forest modeling (Figure
