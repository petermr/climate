<p class="p">Dynamic community process‐based forest landscape models (Scheller &amp; Mladenoff, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) such as the LANDIS models (LANDIS‐II and LANDIS PRO; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a) that incorporate finer scale climate–vegetation–disturbance interactions compared to bioclimatic DGVMs are ideally suited for this integration (Di Febbraro et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Iverson, Prasad, Matthews, &amp; Peters,

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). These models could improve woodpecker distribution modeling, especially within the context of multi‐objective management scenarios (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">Martin, Hurteau, Hungate, Koch</xref>, &amp; North, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Many of the key habitat characteristics and processes (e.g., forest composition and structure, disturbance type, intensity, and temporal trends) that modulate woodpecker population responses are already output variables of forest landscape models, allowing for points of integration between the two modeling disciplines (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a,c). In addition, these models can be modulated by climate data, which is the crucial integration element in the climate–woodpecker–forest framework (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). Integration examples support this proposed framework. LANDIS‐II model projections by Martin et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) found that managing long‐leaf pine habitat for carbon storage decreases biodiversity and Red‐cockaded Woodpecker habitat at the expense of increased carbon sequestration. Similarly, the Black‐backed Woodpecker in boreal forest of Canada are predicted to decline under climate change or business as usual harvest practices (Tremblay et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The LANDIS models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a) allow for climate data integration, simulate ecosystem processes that produce emergent vegetation dynamics that constrain woodpecker distributions, and output variables that can inform woodpecker–forest models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c).
