<p class="p">Generally, geographic forecasts indicate a north–northeast shift of eastern U.S. avifauna species by 2100 (Matthews, Iverson, Prasad, &amp; Peters, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and a concurrent change in community composition (Langham, Schuetz, Distler, Soykan, &amp; Wilsey, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Stralberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). By 2080, breeding bird assemblages of northern Canada and Alaska may gain as many as 80 species, while the greatest species loss is predicted along the Canadian–U.S. border and through the Rocky Mountains (Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Model results show that the resulting dissimilarity to contemporary species composition will be greatest throughout Canada and the Rockies. These trends will downscale to regional extents; for example, upwards of 57% of California may have novel breeding bird species assemblages by 2070 with no current analogs (Stralberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0104" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In addition, central and southern California are areas of peak losses of species in the nonbreeding season (Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
