<p class="p">Generally, North American winter avifauna species richness and the average body mass of community assemblages are increasing (Supporting information Table

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). In eastern North America, winter bird occupancy is being climatically constrained (Zuckerberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and community assemblages are becoming dominated by warm‐adapted species as mean winter temperature increases (Prince &amp; Zuckerberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The northward winter range shift of the Pileated Woodpecker, Red‐bellied Woodpecker, Northern Flicker (larger bodied woodpeckers), and Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker is strongly contributing to these winter community composition changes (Prince &amp; Zuckerberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, only the Pileated and Red‐bellied Woodpecker populations, both resident migrants, exhibited a concurrent increase in abundance during the winter season (Supporting information Figure

In the context of modeling, associated climate change‐induced community‐scale dynamics over time are not necessarily in agreement with spatial climatic trends; that is, under the auspice of climate change, observed spatial gradients relating to climate may not accurately predict temporal trends of species assemblages at the community scale (La Sorte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>).
