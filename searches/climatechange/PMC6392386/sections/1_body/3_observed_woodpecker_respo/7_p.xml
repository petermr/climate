<p class="p">The complexity of woodpecker range responses can be appreciated by comparing several species. Only the Red‐headed Woodpecker (decreased distribution at southern range edge) and Red‐bellied Woodpecker (expansion at northern range edge and northwest range centroid shift) had the same directional response among the breeding and nonbreeding seasons, respectively (Supporting information Table

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The distribution contraction of the Red‐headed Woodpecker and expansion of the Red‐bellied Woodpecker are consistent with them being climate disadvantaged and advantaged, respectively (Supporting information Table

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In contrast, the Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker (

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Zuckerberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0130" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and east during the breeding season (Bateman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), but tracked the mean winter temperature increases northward during the nonbreeding season (La Sorte &amp; Thompson III, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The increase in Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker breeding season abundance between 2005 and 2015 within the United States (Sauer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0096" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) is concurrent with a southern and eastern range shift but appears independent of climatic shifts. Based on the breeding distribution of the Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker between 1980 to 2010 and independent of abundance trends, it is considered disadvantaged by climate change in a majority of the states evaluated (Supporting information Table

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, the northward winter range shift is occurring without a concurrent population abundance change (Supporting information Figure

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker, in contrast to Red‐headed Woodpecker and Red‐bellied Woodpecker range changes explained by climate, highlights the complexity of climate‐based range changes; climate is expected to increase the vulnerability of this species even though it is not inducing observed range and population dynamics.
