<p class="p">There were a limited number of woodpecker models (studies 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 7; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) that predicted future responses to climate change. These were mostly bioclimatic niche models (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and predicted changes to the breeding and/or winter geographic range, abundance, demographic and dispersal responses, niche temperature gradients, secondary responses inferred from range projections (species richness and niche flexibility), and species climate vulnerability (sensitivity, exposure, adaptive capacity; Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). These projections all used one or more climate variables (temperature, precipitation, bioclimatic), and several included nonclimate variables (tree species occurrence, elevation, latitude, plant functional types, land use, biological traits, and survey effort; Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Because the studies used a range of climate models and/or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios, we attempted to compare across similar GHG emissions scenarios, acknowledging the range of responses and, when possible, providing the average response.
