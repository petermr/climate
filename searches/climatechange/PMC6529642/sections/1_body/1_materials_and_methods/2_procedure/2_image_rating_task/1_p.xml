<p class="p">The image-rating task was designed using E-Prime2 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburg, PA). The image-rating task began with participants seated 59 cm from the computer screen. They were told that they were going to be shown pictures and asked to rate them on a scale of 1–9 for each of the variables given on the screen. Images were displayed above a question and rating scale for each variable. For each image, participants were asked how relevant or irrelevant it was to climate change (relevance), how calming or exciting it made participants feel (arousal), and how negative or positive the image appeared (valence), in that order consistently. Each image was presented for each variable scale before the next image was shown in a random order (
