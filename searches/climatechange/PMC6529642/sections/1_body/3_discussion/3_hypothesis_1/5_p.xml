<p class="p">The subject matter present in the images that were rated 
 <italic class="italic">most</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">least</italic> relevant to climate change in this study shows that the high-arousal/low-valence, dramatic and negative, imagery that was correctly predicted to be most relevant to climate change was mainly represented by scenes of natural disaster outcomes. Images of ice floes and industrial buildings with smog were also common themes in this category, although an image of polar bears on ice was rated as the image most relevant to climate change overall. The images rated 
 <italic class="italic">most</italic> relevant consisted primarily of causes and consequences of climate change, with potential solutions represented very little, which replicates previous findings (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>) and suggests that the high-arousal/low-valence combination of emotional characteristics is particularly necessary for images to beseen as relevant to climate change. (However, potential solutions were represented much more in the top 50% of climate-relevant images).
