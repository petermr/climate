<p class="p">The subject matter of the images found to be 
 <italic class="italic">least</italic> relevant to climate change in this study included landscapes or nature, people, and buildings (see 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>). Past research has found that images with similar themes, such as buildings and landscapes, have been ranked as making climate change seem least important (
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>), as have images of people, particularly if they are identifiable (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). This may explain, then, why a photo of US politician Al Gore was determined by our participants to be one of the least relevant images to climate change, despite having won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the IPCC for his work spreading awareness about the anthropogenic nature of climate change (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gibbs and Lyall, 2007</xref>). The ages of our participants (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 20.373, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 3.789) may also be salient, however, as it is possible that they were simply unfamiliar with Gore.
