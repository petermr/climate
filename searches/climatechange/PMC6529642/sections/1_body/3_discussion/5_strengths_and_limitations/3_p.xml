<p class="p">Our study also adds further evidence to support an apparent gap between what imagery non-expert individuals feel is relevant to and best represents the importance of climate change, and what imagery is used by news media when covering climate change. For example, print and digital newspapers in the Canada, US, the UK, and Australia all primarily use images of people, particularly politicians, to accompany these articles (

 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sundblad et al., 2009</xref>), this gap is concerning. Clearly news media’s climate communications are not attending to what their audiences find important in ways recommended by scholars in the field, and our results seem to add support to this.
