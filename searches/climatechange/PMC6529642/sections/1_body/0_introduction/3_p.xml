<p class="p">Emotion is not directly, objectively measured in the majority of past research on climate change imagery. Images’ affect as described in the research is based on participants’ reactions to and descriptions of the images. For example, images of climate change impact is determined to be negative by participants describing them in interviews as “very scary” (

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Ranking images based on these descriptions becomes impossible due to the subjectivity: it is unclear whether a “horrific” image has greater negative affect than a “very scary” image, while an image rated as −5 in affect is certainly more negative than an image rated as −1 (e.g.,
