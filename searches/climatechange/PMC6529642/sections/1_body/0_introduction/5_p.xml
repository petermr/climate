<p class="p">A library of images called Climate Visuals was recently published containing over 1,000 photographs best suited for use in climate change communications based on non-expert perceptions (

 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). A large sample of international participants were surveyed on 30 of those images, rating them on a number of variables, including affect on a scale of −5 to +5 (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). The results from this study showed that participants found typical climate imagery—melting ice, polar bears—to be “cliché,” though they were the most understood and most easily recognizable as being climate images in the survey portion (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Images depicting climate change solutions were generally rated as having positive affect but decreased personal motivation to make climate-beneficial behavioral changes, while images of climate change causes were generally rated as having negative affect but more likely to be shared by and motivate participants to make personal changes (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Chapman and colleagues therefore recommend images depicting non-staged people and large-scale causes of climate change over commonly used visual themes like melting ice when adding visuals to climate change communications (
