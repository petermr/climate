<p class="p">Additionally, we measured participants’ environmental beliefs. Past studies have tended not to record participants’ environmental beliefs or opinions (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>) or not report on them in relation to their findings on climate imagery (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill and Hulme, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Only Chapman and colleagues surveyed participants’ skepticism toward climate change and reported finding that skepticism impacted participants’ feelings toward images of climate solutions (

Individual differences in environmental beliefs and opinions (whether broadly or specifically toward climate change) are important to account for, as individuals’ environmental concern has been shown to be a positive predictor of self-reported pro-environmental behavior (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Steel, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Olli et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clark et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim and Choi, 2005</xref>) and have a positive relationship with environmental policy support and adoption (

 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietz et al., 2007</xref>). Participants’ environmental beliefs were measured using the New Ecological Paradigm Scale (NEP; 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dunlap et al., 2000</xref>), as it is recommended as the standard for this measure (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hawcroft and Milfont, 2010</xref>) and has been widely used both in the US and internationally (see 
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dunlap, 2008</xref>).
