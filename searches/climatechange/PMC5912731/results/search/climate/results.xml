 <result pre="of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change. This paper is thus the first to examine"/>

 <result pre="determinant of the public’s willingness to take actions to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change [ 47– 49]. Research in this domain has"/>
 <result pre="shown that the public generally perceives the threats posed by" exact="climate" post="change as less important than the scientists do, especially"/>
 <result pre="is linked to the vague and seemingly distant features of" exact="climate" post="change, both spatially and temporally. Consequently, studies increasingly highlight"/>
