<p class="p">Last, we projected each species’ presence probabilities under the current and future climatic conditions of its respective pollination network location. To summarize the different ensembles of projections (240 projections per time step, per RCM, and per species), we discarded models exhibiting TSS and ROC scores below 0.6 and 0.8, respectively, and computed a mean of the occurrence probabilities of the remaining ones, weighted by their respective model predictive accuracy (i.e., TSS scores). Overall, the different models exhibited high evaluation scores (mean TSS score, 0.82 ± 0.09; mean ROC score, 0.95 ± 0.05), and atlas and GBIF species exhibited similar ones (mean TSS score, 0.81 ± 0.08 for atlas species and 0.87 ± 0.11 for GBIF species; mean ROC score, 0.95 ± 0.04 for atlas species and 0.95 ± 0.06 for GBIF species). We therefore obtained one probability of occurrence per species, per network, per time step, and per RCM.</p>
