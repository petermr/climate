<p class="p">Our approach certainly makes some simplifications that are worth considering. To begin with, one should be careful when estimating climatically induced extinction probabilities from the decrease in climatic suitability predicted by species distribution models. For example, species may have different climatic niches than the ones observed, which would distort our estimation of extinction risk. In addition, our climatic scenario predicts the extinction of species at a particular site but does not consider the possible arrival of new species at this site. Long-lived herbs may stay alive for even decades without recruitment, and populations may be more resilient than predicted because of evolutionary responses and trophic flexibility (

 </xref>). Therefore, one has to look at our scheme as the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, our framework is missing climatically induced extinctions of insects, which would add to the simulated coextinction cascades, thus pushing even more plants toward extinction. Last, it is not clear to what extent our results would apply to other types of interactions such as in food webs. Given the similar collapse of food webs once species extinctions reach a critical point (
