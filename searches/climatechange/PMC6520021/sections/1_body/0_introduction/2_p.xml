<p class="p">Our study is based on a dataset of seven European pollinator networks compiled from the web-of-life dataset (see Materials and Methods), for which phylogenetic relationships (figs. S1 and S2) and information about plants’ functional traits (database S1) were gathered from various sources. Specifically, the seven networks belong to Mediterranean (

 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>) biogeographic regions (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), ranging from 52 to 797 species (plants and pollinators), and contain information about the following plant traits: clonal reproduction (yes/no), seed dispersal (wind/animal/others), flower shape limits pollen exchange by animals (yes/no), seven classes of flower color, and five types of Raunkiaer life-form (see Materials and Methods and database S1). These are functional traits central to plant life history. For example, the seed bank may allow a species to persist across unfavorable years, seed dispersal may allow colonizing distant habitats, and floral shape may condition the degree of dependence on pollinators.
