  <italic class="italic">1</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">4</italic>
 </xref>), and recent evidence suggests that it may also affect species interactions (

  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>). A remaining challenge, however, is to be able to predict these effects when progressing from pairwise interactions all the way to species-rich networks (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). Extinctions induced by climate change may trigger coextinction cascades—groups of species disappearing as a consequence of the extinction of species they depend on—thus driving many more species to extinction than originally predicted (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). The magnitude of these coextinctions may depend on the web of mutual dependencies among species and how this web affects community persistence (

  <italic class="italic">8</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>). Species distribution models (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>), however, have traditionally treated species independently from each other. The gap between research on climate change and ecological networks is only now beginning to be reduced (

  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). A first approach has added species interactions (oftentimes inferred through species co-occurrences) as an additional filter to improve species distribution forecasts (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). A second approach, in turn, has started to explore the effects of climate change on network structure (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>) and robustness (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). For example, mutualistic networks, such as those between plants and their pollinators or seed dispersers, have been found to be more sensitive to climatically projected plant (rather than animal) extinctions (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). It remains to be seen, however, to what degree the factors predicting direct extinctions are decoupled from those predicting subsequent coextinctions and whether the presence of coextinction results in different pruning of the taxonomic and functional groups. This information is important if we want to understand the consequences of these coextinctions for the functioning of these networks and their potential to adapt, which very much hinge on their functional and phylogenetic diversity. Here, we use climatically informed local plant extinction sequences in different communities and examine how subsequent coextinction cascades erode plant taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. Our network approach is similar to that of previous work using species distribution models in that our model includes neither potential adaptation nor immigration (
