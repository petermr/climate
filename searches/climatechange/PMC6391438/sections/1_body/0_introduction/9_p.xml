<p id="Par10" class="p">Emissions under the dynamic scenario, when area-weighted for the entire mountain range, were substantially lower than the static scenario (Table

 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) emissions for the dynamic scenario were 257.7 Tg and 0.9 Tg, respectively. The 2013 Rim fire, which burned more than 1040 km

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from our dynamic simulations are equivalent to one Rim fire occurring on average every 3.8 years through late-century. Even when accounting for the prior area burned feedback in estimating future fire size, these results suggest that California will continue to be challenged by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants with climate change.
