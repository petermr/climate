<p class="p">The present findings may also be of special significance to climate change mitigation in Chinese cultural context. As we all know, China is the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitter. According to 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Global Carbon Budget, 2017</xref> published by the Global Carbon project, China covered 28% of global emissions in 2017 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Global Carbon Budget, 2017</xref>). This big number may be hard to plummet, due to China’s pursuing economic growth. What is more, conspicuous consumption and materialism are emerging in contemporary China (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Podoshen et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sun et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), which may in turn hinder individuals to perform low-carbon lifestyles. In this case, policymakers and researchers will be confronted with a tough issue of promoting public engagement in climate change. On the other hand, there is enough evidence to indicate that individualism is increasing and collectivism is decreasing in contemporary China (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yi and Takeshi, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). As indicated by our findings, the rise of individualism may further pose a challenge for public engagement in climate change, because individualism is more related with climate change inaction. The above-mentioned fact should not be interpreted with pessimism. Instead, it reminds us that public engagement in climate change is possible only when psychological barriers of climate change inaction are overcome.
