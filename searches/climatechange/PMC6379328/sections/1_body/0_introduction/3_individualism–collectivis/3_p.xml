<p class="p">We propose that individualism is more related to climate change inaction than is collectivism. This assumption derives support from the following considerations. First, individualist versus collectivist orientations have been found to influence pro-environmental behavior (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenova (2015)</xref> found that the more environmentally active group (sampled from the sustainable communities) was more collectivist in its value orientation than was the less environmentally active group (sampled from the general population). Similar findings were also reported by 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jia et al. (2017)</xref>, who demonstrated that environmental activists were more likely to endorse self-transcendent values (similarly to collectivism, e.g., universalism-concern), while non-activists were more likely to endorse self-interest values (similarly to individualism, e.g., self-direction). In addition, several studies within the framework of cultural worldview have also suggested that individualist worldviews are negatively related with concern about climate change, willingness to behave in climate-friendly ways, and acceptance of related policy measures (e.g.,
