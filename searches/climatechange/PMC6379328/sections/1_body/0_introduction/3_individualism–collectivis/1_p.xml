<p class="p">As mentioned above, barriers to climate change action have been attracting increasing attention, but few studies have explored how cultural orientation may result in climate change inaction. There is a wealth of literature concerning climate change, demonstrating that cultural orientation plays a crucial part in an individual’s attitudinal response to climate change (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Xue et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, a large body of research drawing on Cultural Theory (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982</xref>) has well documented that the ways in which people perceive climate change risk are shaped by the cultural worldviews that they hold (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McNeeley and Lazrus, 2014</xref>). However, individual action against climate change does not necessarily depend on our risk perception of climate change (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bain et al., 2016</xref>). Certainly, there are studies of behavioral responses to climate change, but most of them have largely focused on the difficulty of implementing certain practices rather than on the phenomenon of climate change inaction itself (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Slawinski et al., 2015</xref>). The results of a study conducted in Kiribati by 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuruppu (2009)</xref> suggested that people’s capacity to diversify water resources (a way of adapting to climate change) is constrained by cultural values attached to the material resources they possess. Still, we cannot infer that cultural processes cause climate change inaction based on Kuruppu’s findings.
