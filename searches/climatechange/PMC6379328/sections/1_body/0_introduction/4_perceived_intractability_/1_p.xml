<p class="p">In addition to the individualism–collectivism difference in climate change inaction, we seek to further demonstrate that this difference might be caused by individuals’ perceptions of the intractability of climate change. To the best of our knowledge, the concept of intractability in the environmental psychology domain was originally developed by 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Campbell (1983)</xref> as one of the five characteristics of ambient stressors. According to 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Campbell (1983)</xref>, intractability refers to objective features of ambient stressors, where the isolated efforts of individuals do not bring about substantial changes in the presence of ambient stressors. The fact that climate change is a global problem that requires the combined actions of millions of individuals working together has been accepted by the international community. However, this fact also yields an objective dilemma, that is, climate change is intractable to the action of individuals to change it. Therefore, perceived intractability of climate change in the present study refers to one’s belief that climate change cannot be addressed by individual action. As an intrinsic characteristic of climate change, intractability is distinguished from other closely related concepts, such as climate change helplessness (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salomon et al. (2017)</xref> as the belief that climate change is beyond personal control, which emphasizes individual experience instead of climate change.
