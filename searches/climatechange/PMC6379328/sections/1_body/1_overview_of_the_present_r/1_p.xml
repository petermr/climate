<p class="p">Based on the above descriptions, the present research aimed to demonstrate individualism–collectivism differences in climate change inaction and test whether the perceived intractability of climate change could account for this phenomenon. To this end, three studies were conducted. Given that the relationship between perceived intractability and climate change inaction has thus far received little empirical support, the first two studies were conducted to provide initial evidence for it in the general population. The third study specifically investigated individualism–collectivism. Specifically, Study 1 was designed to identify the possible correlation between perceived intractability and climate change inaction. We hypothesized that climate change inaction is correlated positively with perceived intractability. The aim of Study 2 was to provide more convincing evidence for the causal effect of perceived intractability on climate change inaction. We expected that participants who were reminded of the intractability of climate change would show a greater tendency to climate change inaction than participants in the control condition. In Study 3, we investigated and compared perceived intractability and climate change inaction among collectivist and individualist participants. We hypothesized that collectivist participants would perceive higher intractability than individualist participants, and thus be less likely to take climate-friendly action.</p>
