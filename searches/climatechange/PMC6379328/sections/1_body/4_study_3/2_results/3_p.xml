<p class="p">To further investigate whether PICC has a mediating role between participants’ individualist/collectivist status and CCI, a mediation analysis was performed with CCI as the dependent variable, individualist/collectivist status as the independent variable, and PICC as the mediator. In addition, BCC, CCRP, and KCCA were treated as control variables. For this, M-plus 7.4 was used with 5,000 bootstrap samples (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Preacher and Hayes, 2008</xref>). Individualist/collectivist status was dummy coded with collectivist = 0 and individualist = 1, and all variables were standardized prior to analysis so that the results would provide standardized coefficients. Individualist/collectivist status had a significant effect on CCI (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.204, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.006) and PICC (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.294, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, PICC positively predicted CCI (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.262, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.002). As hypothesized, the tests of indirect effects demonstrated that there was a significant indirect effect of individualist/collectivist status on CCI through PICC (99% CI [0.008, 0.174], 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.018).
