<p class="p">Chinese Values Changing Survey provided a starting point for the Study 3, which was conducted in October 2017. Because of our conceptualization of individualism–collectivism as an individual-difference variable, we only selected participants with extreme individualist or collectivist orientations for Study 3. Following a previously documented procedure (for greater detail, see

 </sup> All participant candidates received an email inviting them to undertake the survey. In addition to the variables assessed in Study 2, the identical measure of individualism–collectivism was also included. A total of 156 surveys were completed and returned (67% response rate), with participants in both an individualist group (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 62) and a collectivist group (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 94). Therefore, the final sample of Study 3 consisted of 156 freshmen (43 women, 113 men), with a mean age of 18.85 years (
