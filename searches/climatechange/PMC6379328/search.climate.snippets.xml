  <result pre="the question of why we do not take action on" exact="climate" post="change. Climate change inaction occurs at various levels involving"/>
  <result pre="various levels involving individuals, businesses, and governments. Individual inaction on" exact="climate" post="change may be manifested in indifference to climate change"/>

  <result pre="cultural orientation, it is reasonable to assume the reverse-that is," exact="climate" post="change inaction may also vary as a function of"/>
  <result pre="psychological level. We propose that individualism is more related to" exact="climate" post="change inaction than is collectivism. This assumption derives support"/>
  <result pre="suggested that individualist worldviews are negatively related with concern about" exact="climate" post="change, willingness to behave in climate-friendly ways, and acceptance"/>
  <result pre="Climate Change Inaction In addition to the individualism–collectivism difference in" exact="climate" post="change inaction, we seek to further demonstrate that this"/>
  <result pre="might be caused by individuals’ perceptions of the intractability of" exact="climate" post="change. To the best of our knowledge, the concept"/>

  <result pre="However, this fact also yields an objective dilemma, that is," exact="climate" post="change is intractable to the action of individuals to"/>
