<p class="p">Local, indigenous, and/or traditional environmental knowledge (TEK) of communities includes information about weather and climate phenomena and their impacts. Collected over generations, and continuously refined through transmission, TEK withstands the test of time. Often very place‐specific, it may also connect the natural environment with social and cosmological processes (Anderson, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Basso, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Berkes, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Indigenous communities are often the first and most drastically affected by climate change due to their displacement to marginal environments and their limited political power. Such communities may have systematic environmental knowledge, including knowledge of processes that can enhance their adaptive capacity. Collaborative analysis of combined TEK and mainstream science can yield critical insights into climate change and adaptation (Bennett et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0301" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Collaborations must be based on relationships of trust; follow cultural, ethical, and legal protocols; and recognize that TEK is embodied in cultural practices and beliefs that are inseparable from deep cultural contexts (Maldonado et al.,
