<p class="p">Knowledge and information intersect with vulnerability to climate change in myriad ways, directly and indirectly shaping peoples' adaptive capacity, exposure, and sensitivity. Knowledge and information arise from within situated contexts (Haraway, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>), and differential “access to knowledge… [shapes] who can benefit from resources” (Ribot &amp; Peluso, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>, p. 168). However, different types and sources of information and modes of knowledge transmission affect how people understand, perceive, and act on information. Additionally, understanding the sociocultural context in which vulnerability is being addressed is essential for the successful use of social‐scientific, local, and/or coproduced knowledge. In addition to processes of governance and culture (reviewed in the previous sections), the ability to mitigate vulnerability is also affected by various aspects and types of knowledge, including knowledge transmission, social memory, traditional ecological knowledge, deep time knowledge, and knowledge coproduction.
