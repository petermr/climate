<p class="p">Another example of knowledge coproduction comes from the Quinault Indian Nation village of Taholah, Washington where the Quinault River joins the Pacific Ocean. Because of climate change and its proximity to the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the village is highly vulnerable to tsunamis, storm surge, and riverine flooding (Quinault Indian Nation,
