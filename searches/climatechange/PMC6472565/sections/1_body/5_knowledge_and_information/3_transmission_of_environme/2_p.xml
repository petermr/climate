<p class="p">Information about weather forecasts and climate predictions is communicated, received, and interpreted through multiple channels, including interpersonal communication, television, radio, the Internet, and social media (Morss et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). People combine information from these multiple sources before they make decisions (Sadri, Ukkusuri, &amp; Gladwin, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Social networks importantly help people access, personalize, and perceive the relevance of information. The phrase “social amplification of risk” describes the fact that people are more likely to attend to a threat about which others in their social network express concern (Kasperson et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). When Hurricane Sandy approached the U.S. East Coast, people with robust social networks, who tended to have greater access to relevant information and better understanding of the risk, were more likely to evacuate, which limited their exposure to the physical hazards (Lazrus, Wilhelmi, Henderson, Morss, &amp; Dietrich, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0086" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Sadri et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0146" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). As social networks bolster adaptive capacities, they help people receive and evaluate information that can enable protective decision‐making. Perception of risk within social networks also plays a critical role in vulnerability mitigation, linking information transmission, social context, and the cultural factors that contribute to risk perception.
