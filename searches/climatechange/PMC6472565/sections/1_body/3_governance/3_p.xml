<p class="p">Representation is a foundational issue. Representation is the ability of different groups to participate in the political processes that establish procedures and influence outcomes, which is crucial for human security in the face of climate‐related stressors. Building upon Sen's (
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>) work on capabilities and the roots of hunger, Watts and Bohle describe a “space of vulnerability” at the intersection of command over resources (such as food), class‐based patterns of social reproduction, and the totality of rights. “A reduction in vulnerability demands a promotion of entitlements…[which is] prima facie political” (Watts &amp; Bohle,

Famine (and equally, the devastating impacts of climate‐related disasters) hits three different and overlapping groups of people: the resource poor, the powerless, and the exploited. This social map of types of vulnerability, they argue, also “has its geographic or spatial counterpart,” as different regions and parts of the world rank higher or lower on each of these variables (Watts &amp; Bohle, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0170" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>, p. 56). This perspective helps us see how limitations in representation (governance with power biased to favor certain groups) are critical in creating and maintaining patterns of vulnerability; and addressing governance is fundamental in reducing vulnerability.
