Vulnerability occurs not only because of the marginalization or poverty of particular social groups but also through the processes that perpetuate or expand marginalization and poverty, potentially including adaptation planning (Anguelovski et al.,

Groups with more political power are more likely to secure funding to plan for, cope with, and respond to climate‐related impacts. It is possible to increase inequalities in adaptive capacity by enabling “powerful geographical groups of people to minimize negative environmental externalities and appropriate positive environmental externalities in particular places, with unjust socio‐environmental consequences” (Collins,
