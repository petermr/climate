<p class="p">There are similar inequalities in adaptive capacity: some communities recover more quickly than others from hurricanes or floods (Logan, Sukriti, &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0092" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Recognizing and understanding these differences requires scientists and policymakers to better understand what access to resources and adaptive capacity entail. The crucial point in understanding both is that they do not reflect a lack of resources, but rather an unequal distribution of available resources (Gaillard, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Ribot, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Sen, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>). The inability of groups of people to secure access to resources and the capacity to adapt to climate‐related impacts directly results from their inability to control their daily life (Gaillard, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), to choose the location in which they live, and how and where they secure livelihoods (Blaikie, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0231" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>). Following from this, climate‐related impacts and the suffering incurred by subsets of the population “reflect development failure where the root causes of vulnerability merge with the origins of other development‐related crises” (Gaillard, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>, p. 222). These development failures stem from issues related to different types of social hierarchies based on racial, caste, and gender discrimination; poverty; and power differentials.
