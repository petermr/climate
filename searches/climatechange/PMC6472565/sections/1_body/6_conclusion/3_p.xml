<p class="p">Stemming from this review, we identify three promising areas of research on differential vulnerability: mobility, uncertainty, and incremental change. Conventional analyses of the spatial extent of vulnerability are usually based on residence and ignore 
 <italic class="italic">short‐term mobility</italic> among different populations. Further research is needed about daily activity spaces as they affect health and exposure to environmental toxins, food accessibility, and the capacity for short‐ and long‐distance travel. Regarding 
 <italic class="italic">uncertainty</italic>, climate change predictions are only one of several sources of knowledge guiding adaptation. Despite uncertainty over climate change predictions, which may constrain governmental action, effective adaptation planning is nonetheless feasible. Additional research on the most effective frameworks for fostering effective adaptation decisions, that are interpretable by different populations, in the face of uncertainty will benefit planning. Finally, with respect to 
 <italic class="italic">incremental change</italic>, climate change presents both acute and chronic challenges for adaptation and requires responses to both pulse events, such as Typhoon Haiyan, and press events, such as sea‐level rise. While the threat of pulse events can prompt governments to reallocate resources from routine activities to vulnerability reduction, gradual environmental change, though equally serious, less often provokes a significant response. Identifying strategies that can promote more effective engagement around the press aspects of climate change offers an important topic for interdisciplinary work.
