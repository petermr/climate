<p class="p">The common element in these examples is a gap, found in many conventional analyses of climate change vulnerability: the failure to assess the effects of environmental and social change against a standard of culturally relevant well‐being or flourishing, rather than mere physical survival. The contemporary exploration of this theme draws heavily on Aristotle's account of 
 <italic class="italic">eudaimonia</italic>, generally translated as 
 <italic class="italic">well‐being.</italic> “Aristotle argued that it is the actions, content and processes of an individual's life that matter, rather than transitory and subjective mental states. Accordingly, eudaimonic accounts focus on the activities, abilities, or ‘functionings’ (rather than goods) that constitute a well‐lived life” (Lamb &amp; Steinberger, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>, p. 3). But we cannot identify “concrete ways of life that would be good, much less best, for every human being” (Perry, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>, p. 63). The “well‐lived life” is in significant measure culturally defined and is likely to find a different realization among Alaska Natives, Chesapeake Bay watermen, and Oakland urbanites. In assessing differential vulnerability to climate change, this is critical and is strongly connected to how people know and understand their environments.
