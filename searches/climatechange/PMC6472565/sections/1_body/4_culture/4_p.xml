<p class="p">Culture and social organization shape vulnerability to climate change in terms of who and what are exposed and how they are sensitive. When a hurricane hits a poor community in a developing country, for example in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, women are three to four times more likely than men to die (Crate &amp; Nuttall,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0171" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This drastically different fatality rate is partly explained by disparities in men's and women's learning and expected behavior. Many women are excluded “from survival skill learning, such as tree climbing and swimming, which help during floods; [and] restrictions on women's movement in times of crisis…[dissuade] women from leaving the home without a male's permission” (Crate &amp; Nuttall,
