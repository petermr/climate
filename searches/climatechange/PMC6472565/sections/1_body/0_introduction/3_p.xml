<p class="p">We start with the observation that while nobody can escape the impacts of climate change, some social groups experience greater loss of resources and greater impacts to livelihoods and cultural identity than others. This differential vulnerability to comparable levels of physical change is primarily a function of social rather than physical factors. In this review, we focus on these crucial but often neglected aspects of vulnerability. We ask: who is most affected by weather‐ and climate‐related impacts, and why? We highlight social scientific evidence, which indicates that access to resources and the ability to reduce exposure to climate hazards are not randomly distributed across society but are the drivers of uneven vulnerability across social difference. Social science modes of investigation improve our understanding of the reasons that uneven vulnerability exists and offer practical insights into how to minimize it before hazards become disasters.</p>
