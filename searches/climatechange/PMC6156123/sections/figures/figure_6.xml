  <p class="p">Correlation networks of transcript expression in 
   <italic class="italic">Rhizophora mangle</italic>. Circular nodes represent transcripts and edges represent the correlation between pairs of transcripts. The figures show differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between populations and their first neighbors. A blue circle highlights one of the largest clusters of these networks, with a predominance of UETs and over-expressed transcripts detected in subtropical samples. A red circle highlights one of the largest clusters of these networks, with a predominance of UETs and over-expressed transcripts detected in equatorial samples.
