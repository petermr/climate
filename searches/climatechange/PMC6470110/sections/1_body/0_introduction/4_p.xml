<p id="Par5" class="p">To understand how cities can leapfrog through this transformation process, it is pivotal to analyse the main conditions that enable or impede good water governance. In the literature on environmental governance, a plethora of social factors and conditions have been identified that may influence the ability to adapt and respond proactively to the existing and emerging challenges (e.g., Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>; Eisenack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, despite this rich literature, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes that enhance or limit the water governance capacity of cities is largely missing. Governance, transformation and adaptation processes are often not transparent. First, most identified conditions are based on theoretical and conceptual rationales that are not fully validated by empirical data (Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kersberger and Waarden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2004</xref>). Second, existing empirical studies are predominantly descriptive or focus on specific case studies that limit their usefulness and learning value beyond the individual context (Measham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>). Third, concepts, definitions, measurements and methodologies are often inconsistent and not specific (Eisenack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2014</xref>).
