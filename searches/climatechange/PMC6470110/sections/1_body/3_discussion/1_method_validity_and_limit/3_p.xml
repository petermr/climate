<p id="Par29" class="p">Cities with high pressures (high TPIs) usually have low BCIs, most probably because they face more constraints and challenges in attaining good water management, which is in line with earlier observations (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015a</xref>). The climate readiness index measures the ability to absorb and mobilise financial support for climate change adaptation. Its high correlation with the BCI means that cities with good IWRM performance are also climate-ready (Koop and Van Leeuwen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2015b</xref>). Governance capacities may also be low in developing cities, due to their high social and financial pressures. Unfortunately, the current number of cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 15) analysed by the GCF is insufficient to calculate valid correlation coefficients. The BCI correlates well with the GDP per capita of a country (r = 0.70), which makes sense as there are more financial resources to invest in urban water management. However, the BCI correlates better with The World Bank’s indicator 
 <italic class="italic">governance effectiveness</italic> of countries. The differences in BCI between cities within a country can be rather substantial, meaning that these correlation coefficients have limited empirical value, but they still do provide one of the most accurate indications available for developments in urban IWRM.
