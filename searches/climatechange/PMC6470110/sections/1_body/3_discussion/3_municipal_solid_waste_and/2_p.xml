<p id="Par33" class="p">Wastewater disposal and treatment systems in developing cities are underdeveloped. They often include aerated lagoons, septic tanks and latrines (Varis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2006</xref>). The number of wastewater treatment plants is increasing globally, but this development is unable to keep up with the rapid population growth and urbanisation observed in many cities in Asia. This off-site centralised treatment is preferable to improve public health and to reduce environmental contamination. However, local regulations, land availability and a lack of financial resources to build sewer infrastructure are reoccurring constraining factors (Kerstens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2015</xref>). The slow progress in developing centralised treatment plants results in more attention for the ‘community as users’ principal, e.g., community-based sanitation (CBS) and decentralised wastewater treatment system programmes (DEWATS; Prihandrijanti and Firdayati 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sofyan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2016</xref>). CBS and DEWATS programmes are demand-driven approaches with high community involvement. They require less extensive infrastructural investments. Still, continuous supervision and improvements are needed to ensure the quality of the treatment units since they are known to have comparably low removal efficiencies (Kerstens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2015</xref>). It is also important to provide local communities with regular assistance in using and maintenancing these services.
