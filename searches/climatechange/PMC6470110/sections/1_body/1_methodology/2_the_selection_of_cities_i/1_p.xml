<p id="Par8" class="p">In order to study Asia’s urban water management, 11 cities were selected that represent the rapid transformation of Asian cities, including a diversity of cities at different stages of this transformation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The selection of cities for this study was not random. It was made based on existing collaborative research networks of the University of Utrecht and KWR Watercycle Research Institute, e.g., Watershare
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (Watershare 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2017</xref>a, b), where we tried to include a representative selection of cities in a variety of Asian countries. All the selected cities (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) are rapidly expanding. Most of them are located along the coast (e.g., Bangkok and Jakarta), islands (e.g., Singapore and Taipei) and some are inland (e.g., Ahmedabad and Hohhot). The differences in geographical setting and level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reflect the diversity in the continent and allows for the identification of priorities, barriers and enablers to develop the capacity to transform water management in Asian cities.
