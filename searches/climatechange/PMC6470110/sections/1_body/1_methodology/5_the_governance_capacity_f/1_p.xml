<p id="Par11" class="p">The GCF analyses the governance capacity of a city to address a specific common water challenge (Koop et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2017</xref>; Watershare 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2017b</xref>). The GCF provides information on how well different organisations can work together and to what extent capacities are institutionalised. In this way, governance capacity is understood as the result of human skills and expertise. In its more recent extension, the GCF has been applied in 15 cities where the publications of Quito (Scheurs et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2018</xref>) are available online. The GCF consists of three dimensions and nine conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Each condition has three indicators that are scored using a Likert scale ranging from very encouraging (++) to very limiting (− −) the overall governance capacity to address a water challenge. A detailed description of the Likert scale for each of the 27 indicators is available (EC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2018</xref>). Water governance is assessed with respect to five challenges: (1) flood risk, (2) water scarcity, (3) solid waste treatment, (4) wastewater treatment and (5) urban heat islands (UHI). The indicator scoring was done through a triangular approach to validate findings by different sources in three consecutive steps:

   <p id="Par13" class="p">Interviews with relevant local stakeholders. Stakeholders in each city were analysed and categorised to ensure the representativeness of interviewees and the diversity of water managers. This paper categorised the stakeholders based on their importance/influence, functionality or power/interest. Multiple interviewees from identified stakeholders were selected for in-depth interviews to collect information, score the indicators and ask follow-up questions for clarification or a better overall understanding. To minimise the risk of bias and assure diversity amongst interviewees, they were selected according to their roles, expertise and responsibilities. Based on the interviews, the preliminary indicator scores were updated.</p>
