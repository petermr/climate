 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span> to 
  <span class="bold">F</span>) Observation (black line) and model (red line). EC is used synonymous to BC. Horizontal bars indicate sampling duration. Vertical error bars show observational uncertainties (1 SD). (A) Alert BC concentrations. (B) Alert fraction biomass burning. (C) Zeppelin BC concentrations. (D) Zeppelin fraction biomass burning.

  <span class="sup">2</span>) and 
  <span class="italic">P</span> values between mode and observation are shown for all stations in each respective panel. (G) BC fossil (fuel) concentrations are the product of 1 − 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> and BC concentration. (H) BC biomass (burning) is the product of 
  <span class="italic">f</span>
  <sub>bb</sub> times BC concentration.
