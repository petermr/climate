      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Achieving a ‘balance’ in GHG emissions implies that any difficult-to-abate emissions
         of CO
         <sub>2</sub> and non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> gases, expressed in CO
         <sub>2</sub> equivalence through a metric of choice, need to be compensated by negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions. The choice of metric type and time horizon for calculation of CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions will affect the magnitude of net negative emissions of CO
         <sub>2</sub> needed to produce net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. 
         <a>Figure 4</a> uses N
         <sub>2</sub>O and CH
         <sub>4</sub> as representative long-lived and short-lived non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> gases to demonstrate the effect of metric type and time horizon on the required amount
         of net negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to achieve a net-zero balance in terms of CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. GTP
         <sub>100</sub> gives substantially lower weight to methane emissions than under GWP
         <sub>100</sub>, and consequentially smaller amounts of net negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions are needed than when considering GWP
         <sub>100</sub>. In general, metric choice affects the amount of negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions needed to balance residual CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions much more than for residual N
         <sub>2</sub>O emissions. This is due to the fact that N
         <sub>2</sub>O, like CO
         <sub>2</sub>, is long-lived, so it can be compared against CO
         <sub>2</sub> in a much more like-for-like fashion leading to relatively little variation in values
         between the different metrics.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the physical consequences of net-zero balance will depend on the choice of metric,
         it is important to evaluate to what extent differing metrics correspond to differing
         physical consequences under maintained net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions, for example, its global temperature consequences. 
         <a>Figure 5</a> shows the evolution of global temperature relative to 2100 under the maintenance
         of net-zero emissions between CH
         <sub>4</sub>, N
         <sub>2</sub>O and CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions using different metrics and time horizons. Emissions of CH
         <sub>4</sub>, N
         <sub>2</sub>O and (negative) RF due to other (non-CO
         <sub>2</sub>/CH
         <sub>4</sub>/N
         <sub>2</sub>O) climate forcers are held constant at 2100 values after 2100, with removals of CO
         <sub>2</sub> imposed in each year to maintain a net-zero balance between the CO
         <sub>2</sub>, CH
         <sub>4</sub> and N
         <sub>2</sub>O emissions under the range of metrics considered for these highly idealized cases.
         To assess the global mean temperature response to this balance, we use a simple impulse–response
         climate model (FAIR) which is calibrated to capture the dependence of the climate
         response to pulse emissions on the background climate state [
         <a>29</a>]. Solid lines in 
         <a>figure 5</a> represent the climate response to net-zero balances imposed from 2100 onwards for
         the representative concentration pathway RCP2.6 scenario, with the thin lines representing
         the range of responses in the full set of 430–480 ppm scenarios from the IPCC AR5.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all the metric choices considered (
         <a>figure 5</a><span>a</span>), we find a non-zero temperature impact of maintained balance, in part due to (i)
         the metric-dependent time profiles of CO
         <sub>2</sub> removal and its associated cooling, (ii) the continued climate impact of forcing
         before 2100 and (iii) the cooling effect of additional (negative) non-GHG climate
         forcing (held constant after 2100) which is not included in the calculation of net-zero
         balance. Balance based on the 
         
         <div><span></span></div> metric comes closest to holding temperatures constant, while the other metrics give
         stronger cooling effects. As shown by [
         <a>5</a>], using 
         
         <div><span></span></div>, maintaining a constant rate of an emission of CH
         <sub>4</sub> becomes equivalent to a zero rate of CO
         <sub>2</sub>. The other metrics, GWP and GTP, compare, over a finite time horizon, integrated
         RF from CH
         <sub>4</sub> to the integrated RF of CO
         <sub>2</sub>—which continues to affect the climate on a much longer time scale than CH
         <sub>4</sub>. The higher the metric value for methane, from 4 for GTP
         <sub>100</sub> to 84 for GWP
         <sub>20</sub>, the larger negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions are needed to obtain net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions (
         <a>figure 4</a>), and consequentially larger cooling as a result of net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions (
         <a>figure 5</a><span>a</span>). (It may be noted that this consequence of imposed net-zero balances is hence the
         opposite to what would occur when CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions are reduced instead of CO
         <sub>2</sub>—where a long-term warming is the result of trading methane based on GWP equivalence
         (e.g. [
         <a>30</a>,
         <a>31</a>].)
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the climate response to RF is not instantaneous, the temperature responses shown
         in 
         <a>figure 5</a><span>a</span> are also affected by the forcings from previous emissions, and therefore the post-2100
         evolution of warming shown in 
         <a>figure 5</a><span>a</span> is not solely attributable to the effects of the imposed net-zero balance from the
         emissions shown in 
         <a>figure 4</a>. The isolated temperature effects of the emissions included in any net-zero balance
         can be evaluated by applying them as a perturbation on top of a background emissions
         scenario. In 
         <a>figure 5</a><span>b,</span> we use an emissions background of maintained 2100 values of emissions and other forcings
         in the RCP2.6 scenario and add an additional perturbation of the maintained net-zero
         balances between 2100 residual CH
         <sub>4</sub> and N
         <sub>2</sub>O emissions (from the individual 430–480 ppm scenarios), and negative CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions according to different metrics, from 2100 onwards. The temperature outcome
         is then differenced from the standard RCP2.6 case to isolate the effect of the perturbation.
         In this isolated and idealized case for illustration, the near-term warming of CH
         <sub>4</sub> is clearly seen, with warming initially rising under metrics that give a low weight
         to methane. Conversely, as the GWP* metric balances the sustained CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions with a single pulse removal of CO
         <sub>2</sub> in the first year, the cooling effect from this pulse removal is the dominant near-term
         signal with the net temperature returning towards zero.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Which perspective to use—including effects of previous emissions or the isolated effects
         of the balanced remaining emissions—is one of the questions that need to be answered
         to obtain a clear and operational definition of GHG balance.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the Paris Agreement aims to limit peak warming and it also provides a broad
         timing for achieving the Article 4 ‘balance’, it is of interest to understand how
         the timing of achieving net-zero emissions relates to timing of the peak in global
         mean temperature increase, and how different metrics affect this relationship. 
         <a>Figure 6</a> shows the timing of net-zero emissions versus the timing of peak warming in the scenarios
         available in the IPCC AR5 Scenario Database. For a hypothetical case in which only
         CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions occur, we would expect peak warming to occur very rapidly after the achievement
         of net-zero emissions [
         <a>32</a>]. As the CO
         <sub>2</sub>-forcing equivalent (grey), by construction, achieves a perfect equivalence between
         other GHGs and CO
         <sub>2</sub> in terms of their effect on global temperature, CO
         <sub>2</sub>-fe shows the closest relationship between the timing of net-zero emissions and the
         timing of peak warming in 
         <a>figure 6</a>. For the other metrics shown, GWP* (brown) best captures the link between the date
         of peak warming and the date of net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-forcing equivalent emissions, with other metrics typically reaching net-zero emissions
         after peak warming has occurred. (The net-zero timing is calculated using CO
         <sub>2</sub>, CH
         <sub>4</sub> and N
         <sub>2</sub>O only, so the scatter is also in part associated with the profiles of other forcing
         agents.) GWP
         <sub>100</sub> results in a delay of about 20 years between the timing of peak warming and the timing
         of net-zero emissions.

         <sub>20</sub> and GTP
         <sub>20</sub> are seen in

         net-zero emissions are not reached before 2100 in the vast majority of scenarios (
         <a>figure 2</a>). GTP
         <sub>100</sub> is again closest to 
         
         <div><span></span></div> because little weight is given to methane, while in all cases the timing of peak
         warming is either contemporaneous with the timing of net-zero emissions or occurs
         later.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative approach to interpret and define balance would be to counterbalance
         only the long-lived non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs while keeping the emissions of short-lived components constant, as near-stabilized
         emissions of these components (e.g. CH
         <sub>4</sub>) would only contribute to small temperature changes after this point (this is, in
         effect, what net-zero emissions measured by GWP* means). We find that both GWP and
         GTP applied for CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions of N
         <sub>2</sub>O will give good compensation of the temperature effect and that the variance of the
         N
         <sub>2</sub>O-induced warming between metric choices is small (electronic supplementary material,
         figure S1a and S1b). Note that despite being denoted as zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emission based on GWP*, a constant and ongoing high level of SLCF emissions
         may still represent a significant contribution to warming and a mitigation opportunity.
