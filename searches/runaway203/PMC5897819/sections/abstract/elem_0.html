      <p>The main goal of the Paris Agreement as stated in Article 2 is ‘holding the increase
         in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and
         pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C’. Article 4 points to
         this long-term goal and the need to achieve ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions
         by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases'. This statement on ‘greenhouse
         gas balance’ is subject to interpretation, and clarifications are needed to make it
         operational for national and international climate policies. We study possible interpretations
         from a scientific perspective and analyse their climatic implications. We clarify
         how the implications for individual gases depend on the metrics used to relate them.
         We show that the way in which balance is interpreted, achieved and maintained influences
         temperature outcomes. Achieving and maintaining net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions conventionally calculated using GWP
         <sub>100</sub> (100-year global warming potential) and including substantial positive contributions
         from short-lived climate-forcing agents such as methane would result in a sustained
         decline in global temperature. A modified approach to the use of GWP
         <sub>100</sub> (that equates constant emissions of short-lived climate forcers with zero sustained
         emission of CO
         <sub>2</sub>) results in global temperatures remaining approximately constant once net-zero CO
         <sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions are achieved and maintained. Our paper provides policymakers
         with an overview of issues and choices that are important to determine which approach
         is most appropriate in the context of the Paris Agreement.
