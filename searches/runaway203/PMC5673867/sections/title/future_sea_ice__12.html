      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to helping improve the understanding and prediction of the coupled climate
         system, model simulations in the framework of ACCESS have been used to provide guidance
         on what range of future sea ice conditions may be encountered in areas where it affects
         human activities, such as shipping. Here we make use of the DEXP8.5 experiment with
         finer spatial resolution, zooming into the regions most relevant for long-distance
         shipping in the Arctic. We focus on the sea ice conditions in near-coastal areas and
         along potential shipping routes, in terms of sea ice concentration, thickness, and
         the length of periods with ice conditions that are favorable for shipping. As different
         ship types have different limits regarding their capability to navigate in different
         sea ice thickness and concentration conditions, we analyze the number of days for
         which sea ice thickness (sit) and sea ice concentration (sic) fall below specific
         thresholds relevant for shipping. The analysis is based on daily mean sic and sit
         from experiment DEXP8.5. Figure 
         <a>5</a> shows the number of days per year below these thresholds as an ensemble mean over
         the period 2026–2040. The model experiment suggests that there will be a considerable
         lengthening of the navigable season. For example, along the NEP in the period 2015–2040
         there are more than 40 days with sic below 40% and sit below 0.5 m
         <a>6</a> (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). However, the number of days is the sum of all ‘low ice condition’ days, which are
         not necessarily taking place in a row, so to allow easy passage.

                  for the mean over 2026–2040. “Low ice conditions” are defined as daily mean sea ice
                  concentration (sic) &lt; 20, 40 and 60% and daily mean sea ice thickness (sit) &lt; 0.5,
                  1.0 and 1.5 m

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An alternative view on the ice conditions as they are relevant for shipping is presented
         in Fig. 
         <a>6</a>. It shows the daily sea ice thickness of DEXP8.5 for each ensemble member along the
         NEP for the year 2040. The graphs exemplify that despite the largely ice-free passage
         in each of the three ensemble runs over an extended period of one to three months
         in summer, there may be still blockages at key locations. Those are the Vilkitsky
         (km 2600) and the Dmitry–Laptev Strait (km 5000), in or east of which even thin and
         mobile ice may pile up or be stacked to block the passage. While it is unclear how
         likely such blockages will be in a future Arctic, Gerdes and Köberle (
         <a>2007</a>) speculated that persistent large-scale wind patterns in the Earth system models
         may lead to such situations, too, and it is unclear how realistic those might be.
         The results presented in Fig. 
         <a>6</a> also show the large internal variability in the system, leading to different realizations
         of the sea ice situation despite the same forcing for the three ensemble members.
         Figure 
         <a>7</a> shows a different way to understand the sea ice development along the NEP, by presenting
         the number of days with sic and sit being below a certain threshold along the entire
         NEP contrasting the period 2006–2020 with 2026–2040. The mean number of days with «low
         ice conditions» as well as the ensemble spread increases considerably for the later
         time period. The «low ice» period starts one month earlier and ends one month later
         in the later time period. Moreover, the length of the period with sit &lt; 1.5 m increases
         by four months, lasting from May to February.

                  NEP with the distance traveled from Northern Norway to the Bering Strait in color
                  code. The remaining three panels illustrate model projections of the daily sea ice
                  thickness in 2040 for each of the three ensemble members of DEXP8.5 along this path.
                  The vertical axis shows time (month), and the horizontal axis shows the distance along
                  the NEP from the starting point in Northern Norway (left) to the Bering Strait (right)

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model results and the analysis in terms of parameters relevant for shipping suggest
         that despite an overall increase of navigability in the Arctic, still a lot of variability
         of sea ice cover needs to be taken into account over the coming decades. This will
         make a reliable weather forecast, which is also the prerequisite for a short-term
         sea ice prediction, even more important.
