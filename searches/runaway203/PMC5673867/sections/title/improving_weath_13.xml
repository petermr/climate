 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possibilities in the Arctic for increasing activities such as ship traffic and resource exploitation also mean that operators need to deal with risks related to the physical Arctic environment (weather, ocean, sea ice). Operational challenges include risk factors such as low temperature, occurrence of high winds, fog, and darkness during the winter season. Marine operations might additionally be influenced by ocean waves, icing from sea sprays, and the presence of sea ice and icebergs. These environmental factors may occur in combination, thus increasing the operational challenges. In remote areas, the infrastructure and capability to manage difficult situations, hazards, or accidents may be distant or even unavailable in many cases.</p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This emphasizes a need for risk management for operators in the Arctic (Emmerson and Lahn 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2012</a>). Weather forecasting is one element of risk mitigation, helping operators to have knowledge of weather-related risk in advance through forecasting capabilities at time ranges from a few hours to days ahead. Weather forecasts are also input to ice forecasting, so it contributes to dealing with risks connected to ocean conditions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forecasts from short-range Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are the main tool in such forecasting. Work undertaken at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) as a part of ACCESS has assessed the forecasting capabilities in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic by investigating the forecast performance of the global ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting) NWP and the regional HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) model previously run at MET Norway. Pressure at mean sea level (MSLP) is a meteorological quantity not easily felt, unlike wind or temperature, but still the pressure field is closely connected to the weather systems. For instance, away from topography, the wind is closely connected to the pressure gradient through the so-called geostrophic relation. Pressure is much less influenced by local topographic and surface conditions than wind or temperature, and thus comparing pressure verification statistics at different locations is very well suited for getting a picture of how the NWP models are able to capture the main large-scale weather system variations.</p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a> shows root mean square errors for MSLP of the HIRLAM regional NWP model. For this sector of the Arctic, there is a striking general decrease in forecast quality when moving northwards. This is seen in spite of the fact that the day-to-day pressure variability (not shown here) is comparatively small at the highest latitude stations.

 </p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A candidate for explaining the decline in the quality toward the North would be the corresponding decrease in the observation density of the conventional meteorological observing network. The NWP forecasts depend on determining the initial state of the atmosphere using observations in the so-called data assimilation. For surface observation data, there is a general gap in pressure observations over parts of the sea ice domain and parts of the ocean domain as there is only limited coverage from drifting buoys. There is almost no coverage of near-surface wind observations over sea ice. The wind coverage over ocean is good due to satellite scatterometers providing surface wind observations (see, e.g., Figa-Saldana et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">2002</a>) and over populated continents due to conventional surface meteorological stations. Surface pressure gradients and near-surface winds are closely linked in the Arctic through the geostrophic relationship. However, where only pressure gradient information is available through wind observations, the absolute value of the pressure field would need to be settled thanks to an extended coverage of surface pressure information.
 </p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the period of the ACCESS project, a novel state-of-the-art convection resolving regional NWP system covering a high-latitude area, the so-called AROME-Arctic model, was implemented at MET Norway. This is a version of the HARMONIE-AROME
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7" href="#Fn7">7</a> model and runs at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 km grid length. For applying observations to update the model initial state for the forecasts, the AROME-Arctic model uses three-dimensional variational assimilation system (3D-VAR) for atmospheric and optimum interpolation (OI) for surface data assimilation. This system was used to perform observing system experiments (OSE) including all available surface and upper-air conventional observations and radiance observations from NOAA and METOP satellites. These experiments indicated that

   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par38">the present upper-air conventional (radiosondes, aircraft) observations in the area are too scarce to have a significant effect on forecasts;</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par39">satellite remote sensing data for vertical profiling of the atmosphere (sounding data) play an important role in improving forecasts quality. This clearly highlights that satellite information will be important also in the future evolution of the Arctic observing system and that enhancing the extraction of information from such satellites could be a key area.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the satellite sensors mentioned above are on polar-orbiting satellites, which have the property that the density of the ground tracks increases poleward, thus giving good coverage in the Arctic. Our ability to benefit from satellite information in analyses and forecasts of numerical weather prediction systems evolves with time, and there is a potential for further enhancing our methods for exploiting already existing satellite sensors. Efforts in this direction would not require new satellite programs and could be a way of improving forecasting with further research at relatively limited cost. Key areas which we believe have a potential for improving information from satellite remote sensing (sounding) instruments for NWP in the Arctic are as follows:
  <div list-type="order" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par41">Accounting for the surface contribution to the signal over sea ice: Sounding channels with significant contribution to the measured signal from Arctic Ocean sea ice surfaces are usually rejected in the data assimilation. If we could account for the contribution from the surface by drawing information on emissivity and emitting temperature in new ways, it will enable us using more channels providing temperature and moisture information in the lower troposphere (see, e.g., Tonboe et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2013</a>; Karbou et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">2014</a>).
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p id="Par42">Better ability to describe and account for the cloud contribution to the signals: Clouds are ubiquitous in the Arctic and assimilation of satellite sounding data relies on a « cloud clearing » procedure before assimilation which has a goal to only allow assimilation of channels without cloud contribution to the signal. There is a potential for improving the reliability of cloud clearing and also for novel methods to exploit the cloudy signals (following, for instance, the ideas for «all-sky» assimilation demonstrated by Geer et al. 
     <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2010</a>).
    </p>
   </div>

 </p>
 <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finding scenarios for new satellite missions or programs is expensive and subject to well-established long-term processes and thorough investigations in the international satellite agencies. One can hope that further evolution of the satellite observing system will help fill the observation gap in the Arctic, but this can only happen in the long term (WIGOS 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2013</a>). Here we will mention some possible extensions of the conventional observing network, which could be practically and even economically realistic to implement in a shorter time range, although it would still require some funding scheme and possibly international cooperation.
 </p>
 <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When looking for options for such extensions, it is attractive to look for alternatives with the lowest cost relative to the impact on forecast. There is extensive literature on the impact of observations or observation types on NWP forecast quality; however, few studies consider also the cost of each observation to rank observation types according to impact per cost. Nevertheless, Eyre and Reid (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2014</a>) made the first attempt to investigate this in a global forecasting context. This study pointed to many uncertainties and needs for refinements of the methodology, but the results showed drifting ocean surface buoys to be the conventional observation type with the largest impact per cost globally (see also Andersson and Sato 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2012</a>). This is probably related to the fact that they are often deployed at locations where few other observations are available. Also conventional aircraft observations showed good impact per cost, and radiosondes showed moderate impact per cost on average.
 </p>
 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three-dimensional nature of the atmosphere and previous experience certainly indicate that profile information (sounding) is important. A relatively cheap way to obtain more conventional sounding data is to perform more frequent radiosonde launches at already existing launch sites (at least twice per day or four times per day). There are a few existing radiosondes stations with staff and necessary infrastructure at some remote Arctic islands. Since basic infrastructure for these launch sites are already in place, increasing the number of launches per day at these sites could be a good solution to provide cost-efficient extended data coverage. Our investigation showed that guaranteeing at least two launches per day of radiosonde at already existing sites provides benefit for the updated initial state (analysis) and forecasts of geopotential and humidity, while four times launch per day provides a further significant beneficial impact on analysis and forecast of all verified parameters.</p>
 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the indications from Eyre and Reid (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">2014</a>), we should look at the option of increasing the number of surface buoys. Even if that study was for observations globally, it seems reasonable to also expect a good impact of these observations in the Arctic, based on the decrease in the observation density of the conventional meteorological observing network when going northwards, and lack of satellite information on surface pressure. Deploying extra buoys in the Arctic has been done in campaigns in the past, so it should be possible to implement it if more funding is made available through some permanent program. Scenarios could include increasing the number of drifting surface buoys measuring the air pressure in the Arctic domain by factors two, three, or four. Surface pressure information is important to assimilation for the dynamics of the atmosphere and such buoys are usually also equipped with temperature sensors providing additional information of interest. We tried to define the optimal network distribution based on the accuracy of the forecasts issued from the analyses using the different scenarios for surface buoy networks. Increasing the number of buoys by a factor of four did not show any overall improvements in accuracy of forecasts for mid- and high troposphere compared to forecasts issued from analyses using three times more buoys. Meanwhile, the accuracy of forecasts issued from the analyses using two times more surface buoys is less than that of those issued using three times more buoys. We conclude that three times more buoys represents a cost-efficient distribution of buoys inside our model domain in the context of our state-of-the-art regional forecasting system.
