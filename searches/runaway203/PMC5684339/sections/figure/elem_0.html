         <p>Global Warming Index from Jan 1950 to May 2017 for HadCRUT4. The anthropogenic contribution
            in orange (with 5–95% confidence interval). The natural contribution (solar and volcanic)
            in blue. The red line shows the combined (total) externally-driven temperature change.
            The dark red line shows the evolution of the GWI when only past forcing and temperature
            data are used. It starts in 1944 - the time when a human-induced warming signal can
            first be detected - followed by a new data point for each month up until May 2017.
            The evolution of the red line indicates the degree of month-to-month variability of
            the index. The thin black line are the monthly (HadCRUT4) GMST data. For illustration,
            blue diamonds indicate when major climate summits took place in context of the monthly
            GMST at that time.
