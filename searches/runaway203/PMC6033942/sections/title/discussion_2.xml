 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a number of caveats relevant to our conclusions. First, because there is no accepted definition of glacial inception, we developed our own to identify a major expansion of permanent snow cover. By requiring complete separation in the time series of hemispheric areal coverage between the equilibrated PI and MIS19 climates, we believe that this condition constitutes a fairly strict criterion to define incipient glaciation. However, we also recognize that any such measure is subjective and thus vulnerable to alternative definitions.</p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, simulations of snow cover are highly dependent on variations in model topography, which cannot be fully represented in global climate models of ~1° horizontal resolution used here. This limitation is especially relevant in regions with cold climates and high elevations and thus becomes particularly important for MIS19. The expansion of permanent snow cover in a cooling climate can be strongly muted in coarse-resolution models that are unable to resolve small-scale topographic variations in mountainous areas
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Therefore, the inferred expansion of glaciation in our MIS19 simulation may be a conservative estimate.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, the GHG concentrations used in the MIS19 experiment are subject to dating errors and interpolation uncertainties in selecting the most accurate values corresponding to a somewhat subjective date of 777 ka for the close of MIS19. However, we have used the recently updated
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span> estimates for CO
  <sub>2</sub>, and our target date agrees well with the end of MIS19 inferred from a recent high-precision 
  <span class="sup">40</span>Ar/
  <span class="sup">39</span>Ar chronology
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>
  </span>. Differences in estimated GHG concentrations within a millennium of our target 777 ka date are small (2–4 ppm CO
  <sub>2</sub> and 10–50 ppb CH
  <sub>4</sub>) and result in minor radiative forcing differences within 0.10 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fourth, CCSM4 does not include ice sheet dynamics and relies on a crude way of accounting for glacial calving that constrains the buildup of a snowpack. This limitation necessitates the use of less precise indicators of glacier formation, such as where snow cover persists above a threshold and where it reaches the maximum allowable depth in the model. These indicators are thus simplifications of complex glacier processes, although our chosen sub-gridscale fractional threshold results in a 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century CCSM4 simulation that agrees with observations of residual August snow cover
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>, and we expect that small-scale topographic variations promote patchy snow cover in excess of the broader regional average.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifth, CCSM4 has a cold bias in northern Canada and northern Siberia
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span> that predisposes the model toward forming permanent snow cover in a cooler climate. However, these are mostly cold-season biases
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>; in spring-summer, the terrestrial cold bias is smaller, while the Canadian Archipelago even has a weak warm bias
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, the model produces too much snow cover in its 20
  <span class="sup">th</span> century transient simulation over Alaska, the Rocky Mountains, and much of northern Canada (including Baffin), which are glacial inception regions in the model
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A confluence of recent studies has greatly improved our understanding of glacial inception during MIS19, with respect to chronology, greenhouse forcing, and climate conditions, although there exist very few detailed observational records for evaluating our MIS19 model simulation. This study bolsters the body of evidence on the late MIS19 climate, when orbital conditions were very similar to present day. Our GCM simulations also significantly advance previous modeling
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>
  </span> by allowing a higher-resolution fingerprint of glacial inception using a more complete representation of climatic processes. The high resolution reveals important dynamical responses involving circulation changes combined with topographic influences that promote glacial inception through the emergence of permanent snow cover regionally. The model suggests that altered circulation in northeastern Canada and Siberia fosters nucleation via reduced ablation, while anomalous onshore and upslope flow from the Pacific Ocean favors glaciation in the Rocky Mountains via enhanced accumulation. Similar responses were found in a previous study with lowered GHG and shown to be directly attributable to higher model resolution
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>, whereas the simplified geography and coarse resolution of EMICs are unable to capture these regional changes. To the extent that these dynamical alterations stem from characteristic surface cooling patterns in colder climates, our findings provide new physical insights into the processes responsible for glacial inception generally. For example, prior research
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span> suggested that altered atmospheric circulation was critical for the inception of the Laurentide Ice Sheet by 116 ka, but that study was unable to identify the relevant physical mechanisms.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study builds on our own prior research through a novel investigation of the EAH by simulating an 
  <span class="italic">actual</span> climate that should have strongly resembled a contemporary climate devoid of anthropogenic carbon emissions, rather than only relying on estimated boundary conditions, as in PI_NAT. Follow-up investigations will benefit from ongoing model developments to explicitly simulate ice sheet dynamics
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span> and increase resolution to even more realistically account for small-scale topographic variations and associated microclimates important for glacial nucleation. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to expand the coverage and spatiotemporal resolution of the very limited observational data for MIS19. In parallel, these kinds of advances in modeling and reconstructions will shed new light on the processes responsible for the end of the MIS19 interglacial climate and the vulnerability of contemporary climate to glacial inception in the absence of anthropogenic interference.
