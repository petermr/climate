      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We present a global climate model simulation, using the Community Climate System Model
         version 4 (CCSM4, see Methods), run on the interglaciation during Marine Isotope Stage
         19c (MIS19)
         <span><a>1</a></span> to provide a ground-truth analog for a contemporary climate system not affected by
         human activities. Both MIS19 and the MIS11 interglaciation have been considered as
         possible analogs to the Holocene (MIS1) (see Supplementary Information), but MIS19
         is regarded as the best analog during the past 800,000 years for which ice-core records
         are available
         <span><a>2</a>,
            <a>3</a></span>. The insolation histories of MIS19 and MIS1 are very similar, such that their caloric
         half-year summer insolation differed by no more than 3 W m
         <span>−2</span> throughout (Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>). The only significant difference in their orbital parameters is the weaker amplitude
         of the obliquity signal during MIS19. By the time equivalent to present day, however,
         the MIS19 obliquity was nearly identical to the modern value, and the precession and
         eccentricity parameters were also very similar (Table 
         <a>1</a>). The strong orbital resemblance between MIS19 and MIS1 enables direct comparisons
         between climatic signals from these two interglaciations, including GHG trends, such
         that the closest insolation analog to the present day occurred at the corresponding
         insolation minimum 777,000 years ago at the close of MIS19

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Substantial glacial inception likely began by 777,500 to 775,500 years ago, based
         on various criteria: the appearance of millennial-scale oxygen-isotopic oscillations
         in marine cores, the appearance of ice-rafted debris in marine cores, and an assumed
         delay between these first-appearance criteria and the accumulation of enough terrestrial
         ice to have driven them
         <span><a>3</a></span>. A similar MIS19 end date of 778.4–776.4 ka +/− 2.3 kyr, based on a detailed 
         <span>40</span>Ar/
         <span>39</span>Ar chronology, was estimated from a high-resolution record from Italy
         <span><a>4</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparable orbital configurations but contrasting glaciation histories of MIS19
         and MIS1 motivated a recent modeling study
         <span><a>5</a></span> using a low-resolution Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) to compare
         the potential for glacial inception in both stages. The model simulated a buildup
         of large-scale ice volume at the close of MIS19, whereas glaciation during MIS1 depended
         critically on whether Holocene CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations followed an inferred natural trajectory to 240 ppm (slightly lower
         than our estimate) or the actual trajectory of 280–285 ppm by the dawn of the Industrial
         Revolution.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper also investigates the onset of glaciation in MIS19 but does so using a
         much higher-resolution global climate model (GCM) simulation that represents circulation
         patterns, energy transport, and hydrologic processes much more realistically than
         an EMIC. Furthermore, we ran a single, unconstrained simulation, whereas the previous
         study
         <span><a>5</a></span> first screened a 20-member perturbed-physics model ensemble and selected only the
         20% of simulations that matched observations of glacial inception at the end of MIS19
         and MIS5 but not MIS1. Our CCSM4 GCM experiment of MIS19 informs whether contemporary
         climate conditions are suitable for glacial inception under the much lower GHG concentrations
         estimated in the absence of both ancient and recent carbon emissions from agriculture
         and industrialization.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reconstructions of CO
         <sub>2</sub> and CH
         <sub>4</sub> concentrations from ice core records
         <span><a>6</a>–
            <a>12</a></span> at Antarctic Dome C, using the EDC3 chronology
         <span><a>13</a></span>, can be compared between MIS19 and MIS1. The MIS19 CO
         <sub>2</sub> trend reached an early peak of 269 ppm, essentially identical to the peak of 270
         ppm early in MIS1, after which both trends started falling (Fig. 
         <a>1b</a>). The MIS19 trend continued declining through the time of the modern-day equivalent
         (777,000 years ago), but the MIS1 trend reversed direction 7000–8000 years ago and
         rose for the remainder of the Holocene. These opposing trends are consistent with
         the prediction from the Early Anthropogenic Hypothesis (EAH) that MIS1 values would
         have continued falling if not for early agriculture, as they did in other recent interglacials
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The 245-ppm CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration estimated as the modern-day equivalent in MIS19 (see Methods) is very
         close to the interpolated 248 ppm value from the latest Dome C data
         <span><a>6</a></span> and lies at the top of our previously estimated 240–245 ppm range
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The difference in CO
         <sub>2</sub> radiative forcing between 245 ppm and 248 ppm amounts to only 0.06 W m
         <span>−2</span> and thus should have a minor effect on the model simulation.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CH
         <sub>4</sub> in MIS19 reached an early-interglacial peak of 739 ppb, compared with the 717-ppb
         peak early in MIS1, after which both trends began falling (Fig. 
         <a>1c</a>). The MIS19 concentration then dropped to a value of 631 ppb by the time of the modern-day
         equivalent at 777 ka, interrupted by a brief CH
         <sub>4</sub> maximum near 778 ka that is interpreted as a millennial-scale oscillation because
         it was defined by two data points separated by just a little over 1000 years
         <span><a>14</a></span>. The CH
         <sub>4</sub> trend then resumed its gradual orbital-scale downward trend through (and beyond)
         the time of the modern-day equivalent, dropping to 530 ppb by around 772 ka (not shown).
         In contrast, the MIS1 CH
         <sub>4</sub> trend reversed direction 5000 years ago and has moved steadily upward since then,
         reaching around 790 ppb just before the industrial greenhouse-gas era began in 1850.
         These opposing directions (down for MIS19, up for MIS1) are again consistent with
         the EAH prediction. In this case, however, the MIS19 CH
         <sub>4</sub> trend remained higher than the downward path of the MIS1 trend proposed in the EAH,
         based on the average trend of many recent interglaciations
         <span><a>15</a></span> and estimated Holocene emissions arising from plant and animal domestication (see
         Methods), but the effect of this difference on radiative forcing is small compared
         with the influence of CO
         <sub>2</sub>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ideally, the contemporary “natural” CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration in the absence of all anthropogenic carbon emissions would be derived
         from an interactive carbon cycle model with an accompanying dynamical vegetation model.
         Unfortunately, neither of these modules is up to the task. Coupled carbon cycle models
         in GCMs are unreliable in their simulations of the observed industrial-era rise in
         CO
         <sub>2</sub>, producing a 45 ppm spread in near-present-day concentration
         <span><a>16</a></span>, which is about twice as large as the pre-industrial CO
         <sub>2</sub> increase from the mid-Holocene that we are studying. Interactive global vegetation
         models in GCMs often produce unrealistic distributions of grasses and trees in the
         present-day climate, highly divergent future vegetation distributions even for the
         same climatic forcing scenario, and a large spread in their carbon-climate feedback
         parameters
         <span><a>17</a>–
            <a>20</a></span>. These modeling inadequacies necessitate the use of prescribed estimates of GHG concentrations.
