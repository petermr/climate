      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We show melting responds rapidly and linearly to the thickness of the relatively warm
         MCDW layer (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>) present at the ice front. Cross-shelf exchange displays intrinsic variability but
         low correlation with melting, suggesting that intrinsic variability in melting results
         from local processes like wind-driven changes to the MCDW layer thermocline depth,
         rather than cross-shelf exchange. Comparison of the COREv1 (intrinsic ocean variability)
         run to a sensitivity study where the interannual intrinsic ocean variability is removed
         from the lateral boundary conditions, shows that indeed the variability that impacts
         the supply of ocean heat to the ice shelf cavity is generated within our model (see
         Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). We can speculate that the non-linear ocean processes that generate such intrinsic
         ocean variability could include long-period baroclinic instabilities, which when subject
         to essentially stochastic winds, give rise to variability in ocean properties across
         a wide band of frequencies. This includes low-frequency modulation of the thickness
         of the MCDW layer on the continental shelf.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chosen surface and lateral boundary conditions mean that any model variability
         with a period of greater than one year must be intrinsic ocean variability that is
         generated within the model, or imported through the Northern, Eastern and Western
         lateral boundaries (see Supplementary Figs. 
         <a>4</a>–
         <a>6</a>). Intrinsic variability in melting occurs underneath the entire ice shelf with a
         maximum range of ~1 m yr
         <span>−1</span> (Fig. 
         <a>3b</a>). The period of variation is multimodal but has dominant periods of ~3 and ~7 years
         (Fig. 
         <a>3f, i</a>). The presence of intrinsic variability is weakest at the shallow ice front, which
         is most susceptible to seasonal sea ice and wind processes, and is stronger at depth
         (Fig. 
         <a>3k–m</a>). Up to 44% of 1–5 year variability and up to 21% of 5–10 year variability in melt
         rate results from intrinsic processes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The in-phase response and high degree of variability that is explained by melt EOF1
         suggests that cavity waters rapidly adjust to ocean heat entering this relatively
         small volume (Fig. 
         <a>3d</a>). Furthermore, the coherent response suggests that a reasonably representative assessment
         of basal melting can be obtained with few observations. The in-phase response also
         makes basal melting beneath TIS a good candidate for data assimilation and for parameterisation
         into an ice sheet model.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high degree of variability in basal melting that results from intrinsic modes
         present in the 1–5 year time band (up to 44%) could contribute to the ~3–4 year period
         variations observed in TIS thickness
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Futhermore, the 5–10 year modes (explaining up to 21% of variation) likely contribute
         to the measured decadal period variations in flux
         <span><a>3</a></span> and surface velocity
         <span><a>4</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, we find that variability in bottom temperature occurs mainly on the shallower
         regions of the continental shelf (Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>), likely resulting from changes in thermocline depth in response to surface wind
         forcing with a peak 5–10 year periodicity (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>). The second EOF (Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>) captures cross-shelf exchange and associated warm water pathways. Both MCDW layer
         thickness and cross-shelf exchange are shown to contain large low-frequency variations
         (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>, 
         <a>c</a>). The similar periodicity to EOF mode 1 results from a common mechanism as upwelling
         responds to wind forcing. The relationship between basal melting and wind stress is
         elsewhere demonstrated to be caused by Ekman pumping and upwelling of oceanic heat,
         which in turn correlates well with observed TIS surface velocity anomalies
         <span><a>5</a></span>. As melting underneath the Totten Ice Shelf has been identified to be driven by the
         relatively dense, warm and salty MCDW in models
         <span><a>25</a></span> and observations
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>29</a></span>, it follows that intrinsic variability in ocean water properties near the seabed
         produces a response in basal melting.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intrinsic variability has been previously identified in Antarctic sea ice patterns
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>31</a>,
            <a>32</a></span>, in the Southern Ocean
         <span><a>9</a>,
            <a>10</a></span>, as well as hypothesised in the ice sheet response to accumulation variability
         <span><a>33</a></span> and in palaeoclimate dynamics
         <span><a>34</a></span>. Our results demonstrate that basal melting can vary on interannual timescales purely
         as a result of internally generated ocean variability, with broad implications for
         the identification of variability in an ice shelf/ocean system.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interannual variability is present in ice shelf elevation change
         <span><a>2</a></span>, surface velocity
         <span><a>3</a>–
            <a>5</a></span> and grounding line location
         <span><a>6</a></span>. However, it is difficult to extract the impact of intrinsic interannual variability
         in melt rate from these broad-scale products due to the disparate temporal and spatial
         scales, and relatively short observation periods. Nevertheless, the presence of interannual
         variability in multiple sources, with similar modes, suggests that some degree of
         the observed variability results from intrinsic processes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study has implications for observing and understanding ice shelf-ocean interaction.
         Basal melting can vary periodically with low-frequency variability, even in the absence
         of interannual atmospheric forcing. This implies that at least part of the variability
         associated with ice shelf thickness and consequently mass balance could arise purely
         through intrinsic ocean processes. This intrinsic variability is subsequently modified
         by external climate drivers to produce the observed record. However, to fully understand
         the temporal and spatial impact on ice shelf flow and thickness dynamics, a coupled
         ocean-ice sheet model is required.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have highlighted the emergence of low-frequency intrinsic variability in cross-shelf
         flow and MCDW layer thickness, which arises through non-linear ocean processes and
         in response to daily-to-seasonal changes in wind stress. Basal melting beneath TIS
         responds linearly to MCDW thickness, but has a low correlation with cross-shelf flow,
         suggesting locally generated intrinsic variability influences the heat available to
         drive melting. This complex variability in basal melting limits the ability of short-term
         observational missions to draw conclusions about the long-term response to anthropogenic
         factors. In this sense, short oceanographic voyages and mooring deployments should
         be employed together with modelling studies to explore longer term trends. In regions
         which display significant interannual intrinsic ocean variability, long-term observational
         time series are critically important. Furthermore, many other ice shelves around Antarctica
         display some form of interannual variability (e.g. Filchner-Ronne, Amery, Shackleton
         and Ross
         <span><a>2</a></span>). The contribution of intrinsic ocean processes to the observed interannual variability
         ice shelves around Antarctica is yet unknown. Understanding and distinguishing this
         component of the signal through modelling studies is important for predicting and
         detecting climate change, planning observational missions that target regions of low
         intrinsic variability, and interpreting satellite and in situ observations.
