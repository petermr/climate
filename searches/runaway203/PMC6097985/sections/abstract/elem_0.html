      <p>The distribution of anthropogenic aerosols’ climate effects depends on the geographic
         distribution of the aerosols themselves. Yet many scientific and policy discussions
         ignore the role of emission location when evaluating aerosols’ climate impacts. Here,
         we present new climate model results demonstrating divergent climate responses to
         a fixed amount and composition of aerosol—emulating China’s present-day emissions—emitted
         from 8 key geopolitical regions. The aerosols’ global-mean cooling effect is fourteen
         times greater when emitted from the highest impact emitting region (Western Europe)
         than from the lowest (India). Further, radiative forcing, a widely used climate response
         proxy, fails as an effective predictor of global-mean cooling for national-scale aerosol
         emissions in our simulations; global-mean forcing-to-cooling efficacy differs fivefold
         depending on emitting region. This suggests that climate accounting should differentiate
         between aerosols emitted from different countries and that aerosol emissions’ evolving
         geographic distribution will impact the global-scale magnitude and spatial distribution
         of climate change.
