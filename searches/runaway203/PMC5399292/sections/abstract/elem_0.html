      <p>In December 2015 in Paris, leaders committed to achieve global, net decarbonization
         of human activities before 2100. This achievement would halt and even reverse anthropogenic
         climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere. However, the
         Paris documents contain few specific prescriptions for emissions mitigation, leaving
         various countries to pursue their own agendas. In this analysis, we project energy
         and land-use emissions mitigation pathways through 2100, subject to best-available
         parameterization of carbon-climate feedbacks and interdependencies. We find that,
         barring unforeseen and transformative technological advancement, anthropogenic emissions
         need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the
         COP21 emissions and warming targets. Fossil fuel consumption will probably need to
         be reduced below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100 and the allowable consumption
         rate drops even further if negative emissions technologies remain technologically
         or economically unfeasible at the global scale.
