      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RE-Low scenario, constructed along the lines of moderate climate action scenarios
         <a>8</a>, projects persistent anthropogenic emissions at least two times larger than the absorptive
         capacity of natural sinks by 2100 (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>=2.1±0.5) (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 1</a>). In the nominal energy pathway, REs grow at an annual rate of 4.4% from 2013 through
         2100, driving the market share of conventional fuels below half of primary energy
         supply in 2100.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although absolute fossil fuel consumption does not begin to decline until after midcentury,
         it peaks lower (590–688 EJ per year around 2054) and declines more rapidly (to 455–583 EJ
         per year in 2100) than in the baseline (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 2c</a>). Annual fossil fuel emissions peak in 2050 at 11.1–12.8 PgC per year and decrease
         to 8.3–10.7 PgC per year in 2100, and emissions from REs grow to 0.7–1.1 PgC per year
         in 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assuming a global, concerted effort to achieve the COP targets, policies driving decarbonization
         of the energy sector in the RE-Low scenario are linked by construction with land-use
         change restrictions eliminating ‘unnecessary' deforestation or forest loss resulting
         from poverty, conflict, poor governance, lack of knowledge and other sub-optimal uses
         of land
         <a>9</a>. FeliX calculates unnecessary deforestation endogenously as the difference between
         fallow agricultural land and cumulative deforestation after 2011. This optimization
         of land use offsets emissions from forest conversion to managed forests and plantations,
         causing annual LULUCF emissions to decrease to 0.1–0.3 PgC per year in 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 4a</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, net anthropogenic emissions peak at 12.2–13.2 PgC per year in 2048 and subsequently
         decline to 9.3–12.0 PgC per year by 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 5a</a>). In response, cumulative ocean and land sink carbon fluxes over the same period
         decrease by 7% and 10%, respectively, relative to BAU. These pathways generate a 13%
         reduction in cumulative emissions relative to the baseline for the period 2011–2100.
         Although they represent progress in terms of atmospheric carbon (
         <span>C</span><sub>A</sub>=633−686 p.p.m.) and surface temperature anomaly (Δ
         <span>T</span>=2.9−3.1 °C), the energy and LULUCF transitions in the RE-Low scenario fall short
         of global emissions and warming targets by 2100 (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Fig. 6</a>).
