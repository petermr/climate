      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before proceeding, we offer a few remarks about 
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> and its aptness as a figure of merit. First, we acknowledge that the roles of the
         ocean and land sinks are often left implicit in carbon budget analyses and the text
         of the Paris Agreement itself leaves ambiguous the definition of ‘net zero emissions'
         insofar as it does not specify whether sinks need be directly anthropogenic (that
         is, deliberately created as a result of mitigation policy) or natural (that is, caused
         inadvertently by the human perturbation of the carbon cycle). We have included natural
         sinks in this analysis to present a complete accounting of global carbon flows and
         because the carbon flux from the atmosphere into other parts of the Earth system (that
         is, biomass, soil and the oceans) will be essential to the magnitude and timing of
         economic and technological interventions necessary to realize the COP targets.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, carbon emissions pathways have an impact on natural sinks through carbon and
         temperature couplings in the FeliX model, but the sinks do not feed back into anthropogenic
         emissions from either the energy or LULUCF sectors. Although some mechanisms could
         complete this feedback loop (for example, permafrost thaw or carbon credits in a hypothetical
         global cap and trade market), they are not included in this analysis. For this reason,
         
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub> separates the external, prescribed drivers of each scenario (that is, anthropogenic
         emissions) from the internal, dynamic responses (that is, natural sinks).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With its global scope, this analysis provides a physical science foundation for consideration
         of the more technically challenging and politically sensitive adaptation and finance
         goals of the Paris Agreement
         <a>1</a>. Similar to the four RCPs established as benchmarks by the IPCC, the scenarios included
         in this analysis cover a broad range of emissions pathways and can be used to generate
         insights into the magnitude and timing of the transitions needed to realize the COP
         emissions and warming targets
         <a>6</a>. In particular, our results show that the achievement of the COP emissions target
         (
         <span>R</span><sub>AF</sub>≤0.0) before 2100 will also be sufficient to limit warming below 2 °C, even after
         accounting for the diminishing magnitudes of ocean and land sinks along decarbonizing
         pathways. This confirms that the COP emissions target should be regarded as the concrete
         benchmark for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and subsequent negotiations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analysis extends beyond the IPCC benchmarks in that the RCPs are not fully integrated
         scenarios of socio-economic, energy and LULUCF emission, and climate projections,
         but rather internally consistent pathways of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.
         Indeed, the RCPs are intended as inputs to coupled emissions–carbon cycle–climate
         models such as FeliX
         <a>6</a>. Thus, although the scenarios in this analysis are not exogenously linked with specific
         RCPs, our reasons for drawing attention to points of comparison between the two sets
         are twofold: first, comparisons across multiple indicators (that is, emissions, radiative
         forcing and warming) serve to establish the internal consistency of the FeliX model.
         Second, comparisons between FeliX scenarios and the RCPs serve to link detailed, particular
         energy and LULUCF transitions with ‘representative' pathways and mark progress towards
         the COP target.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing of peak energy sector emissions is a critical parameter for climate mitigation
         strategies. Even before the superposition of CCS, the RE-High scenario achieves much
         greater progress towards the 2 °C threshold than does the RE-Low scenario, largely
         because the former pathway accelerates peak emissions by over 30 years relative to
         the latter (
         <span>cf.</span><a>Table 1</a>). Deeper and more rapid transformations of global agricultural and LULUCF systems
         can both cut emissions and increase net carbon flux into the land sink, further accelerating
         peak emissions. Indeed, all of the scenarios examined here project progress towards
         curbing emissions from land use and land-use change, but none fully exploit the emissions
         mitigation potential of global agricultural and LULUCF systems
         <a>2</a><a>12</a><a>13</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a set, our scenarios support broad characterizations of successful decarbonization
         strategies. Roughly speaking, and based on current technologies, energy sector emissions
         will need to peak within the next decade. By 2100, the market share of fossil fuels
         will need to fall to less than a fourth of total primary energy demand to preserve
         the possibility of meeting the COP targets.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The RE-High pathway (that is, sustained expansion of REs at a minimum of 5% per year)
         seems at least possible in light of recent trends. Since 1990, low-carbon technologies
         have grown at an annual rate of 2.2%, slightly outstripping annual growth in the total
         primary energy supply (1.9% per year)
         <a>14</a>. Over the same period, solar and wind energy have grown at 46.6% and 24.8% per year,
         respectively. However, this standout growth can be attributed to very low initial
         production rates. Although wind and solar infrastructures have increased by two to
         three orders of magnitude since 1990, their combined capacity in 2015 equalled roughly
         1% of primary energy supply
         <a>14</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also note that, when it is achieved in the 
         
         <div><span></span></div>CCS and CCS emissions pathways and in similar analyses, full decarbonization relies
         on the coupling of CCS technology with bioenergy production, a carbon-negative process
         <a>15</a>. If coupling of CCS technology with bioenergy production is ultimately found to be
         unfeasible, uneconomical or unacceptably burdensome on ecosystems, then alternative
         negative emissions technologies (for example, direct air capture) will need to be
         substituted
         <a>16</a><a>17</a><a>18</a>. In the absence of these fail-safes, fossil fuels will need to be phased out completely
         and well before 2100.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conversely, if the decarbonization of the energy and LULUCF sectors does not proceed
         apace, or if nutrient supply limits land sink carbon uptake
         <a>19</a><a>20</a>, then carbon sequestration technology will need to be employed as quickly and as
         broadly as possible to meet the COP targets. Depending on the economic feasibility
         of carbon feedstocks for chemical production and chemical energy storage, permanent
         sequestration of up to an exagram of carbon (1,000 PgC) may be required. This may
         be technically possible, as global permanent storage capacity has been estimated to
         range from 135 PgC to as high as 2,700 PgC
         <a>21</a>. CCS on such a large scale remains a distant reality, given a current global annual
         geosequestration rate of only 7.3 MtC
         <a>10</a>. On the other hand, this low baseline makes sustained 30–35% year-over-year growth
         in the geosequestration rate a technologically realistic target, even before economies
         of scale begin to lower the energy and infrastructure costs of CCS.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the scientific community's rapidly evolving understanding of interlinkages among
         natural and economic systems
         <a>13</a>, all mitigation options should be evaluated and it is appropriate to consider the
         impact of natural sinks on atmospheric carbon and warming pathways. At the same time,
         the flow of carbon into oceans, plants and soil will affect the functioning of these
         ecosystems and the services they provide. For example, persistent anthropogenic carbon
         emissions may affect agricultural yields and thermohaline circulation, as well as
         the life cycles and long-term stability of forest and marine ecosystems. The consequences
         of these eventualities, which are potentially as severe as those of global warming,
         can only be avoided by achieving the goal of strictly carbon-neutral societies as
         soon as possible.
