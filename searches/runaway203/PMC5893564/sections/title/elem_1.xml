  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two-coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) are used to model the climate response to changes in obliquity, precession, CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets. These are the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Climate Model 2.1 (CM2.1) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2. The temperature response to orbital forcing is also explored in the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3). For CM2.1 and CESM, single-forcing equilibrium simulations are conducted at low (22.079°) and high (24.480°) obliquity, the extreme values of the past 900 ka
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
   </span>. All other forcings, such as greenhouse gases, ice sheets, precession, and eccentricity, are prescribed at preindustrial values. The models lack dynamic ice sheet and carbon cycle components, so orbital experiments capture the short-term climate response, but exclude slow feedbacks related to ice sheets and the carbon cycle. Additional single-forcing experiments isolate the climate response to changes in precession, CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). The HadCM3 simulations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
   </span>, which are only used to examine the obliquity response, employ a different experimental design: simulations are conducted at regular intervals over the past 120 ka using different combinations of orbital forcings, and the obliquity response is extracted from the orbit-only simulations through statistical regression. In all models, obliquity is evaluated as a reduction in Earth’s axial tilt by taking the difference between a low obliquity (22.079°) response and a high obliquity (24.480°) response.
  </p>
  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all three models, reduced obliquity produces pronounced cooling in the mid and high latitudes of both hemispheres and some areas of mild warming near the equator (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Obliquity redistributes insolation but does not alter the global average of annual mean insolation. The change in total radiative forcing, which accounts for albedo, is small (global mean radiative forcing anomalies are +0.1 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for CM2.1 and +0.2 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> for CESM). Despite this mildly positive radiative forcing, cooling is much more widespread than warming, with all three models producing negative global mean temperature change. Global mean temperature anomalies are −0.54 °C for CM2.1, −1.07 °C for CESM, and −0.48 °C for HadCM3. The level of agreement between the models over most latitudes suggests that these results are fairly robust. The primary difference between models occurs in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, where CESM produces considerably more cooling than the other models, associated with widespread Arctic albedo anomalies in summer and fall due to changes in snow cover and sea ice.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the obliquity signal in models and proxy records is central to the current analysis, so it is useful to understand what drives the modeled response. In the tropics, the temperature response is near zero even though annual mean insolation increases by 3.2 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (radiative forcing increases by 2.4 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span>). Analysis of energy transports and radiative feedbacks helps explain the lack of a tropical temperature response to obliquity forcing. In part, the increased radiative forcing is balanced by increased poleward heat transport in both the atmosphere and ocean. In the atmosphere, the tropical portion of this modified heat transport is associated with changes in the Hadley circulation

   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). From the extra-tropics to the poles, poleward heat transport is increased primarily through changes in sensible heat transport, associated with baroclinic eddies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. These atmospheric changes, together with increased ocean heat transport, redistribute heating and diminish the tropical warming. Some locations, especially parts of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, even show a slight cooling (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Equatorial Pacific cooling in CM2.1 and CESM is greater below the surface, which has previously been suggested to explain tropical obliquity variations opposite to local insolation forcing in the early Pleistocene

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At higher latitudes, insolation is reduced during summer months. The change from high-to-low obliquity results in an annual mean insolation decrease of ~13 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles–that is, a loss of 7% of the total local insolation. This translates to a mean radiative forcing of approximately −6 W m

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine how well the modeled responses are reflected in past climate, model results are compared with long proxy time series data from ice and ocean sediment cores. A linear reconstruction methodology, similar to that used in past work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>, is employed to compare the idealized single-forcing experiments with time-varying proxy records. Put simply, results from the single-forcing experiments, which isolate the climate response to obliquity, precession, CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and ice sheets, are scaled by the time-varying forcings of the Late Quaternary to compute model-based estimates of the climate responses to individual forcings over the past several glacial cycles. Summed together, this creates a linear reconstruction of total climate change which can be compared to proxies. To put all records onto comparable age models, sediment cores were aligned to the LR04 benthic stack in past work
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>
   </span>, but some uncertainty exists in ice core age models. Leaving ice core records on their original published age models caused the timing of deglaciations to vary between records and the reconstruction, affecting results. To better align major climate features, Antarctic ice cores were aligned to the annual mean linear reconstructions. The timing of various records remains a potential source of uncertainty in the current analysis.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Past work suggests that the linear reconstruction methodology is more appropriate for some regions than others
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
   </span>, with regions of sea ice presenting a particular difficulty. Still, because orbital forcing is well-characterized and produces highly seasonal responses over much of the world, focusing on regional orbital responses provide a valuable test of proxy records.
  </p>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total linear reconstruction covers 1–430 ka, the older bound of which is determined by the length of the shortest component used in the reconstruction. When interpreting the reconstruction, the obliquity and precession components should be regarded as the short-term climate responses to imposed insolation anomalies, while the additional contributions from greenhouse gas and ice sheet anomalies are quantified separately. This distinction between the direct short-term response, which quantifies the fast climate response to insolation changes, and the slower changes associated with ice sheet and carbon cycle feedbacks, should be kept in mind in the following analysis. See the methods section for more detail.</p>

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This linear reconstruction methodology allows the contribution from each forcing or feedback to be estimated. However, some of the larger mismatches between the ice cores and linear reconstructions appear to be related to the obliquity response. The linear reconstruction is generally too warm when obliquity causes Antarctic warming and too cold when obliquity causes Antarctic cooling. To explore this in a different way, a fitting methodology is employed: at each proxy location, the magnitude of the short-term obliquity component in the linear reconstruction is scaled to find the value that produces the best fit between the total linear reconstruction and the proxy record. This is done for the three Antarctic ice cores as well as a variety of records from other latitudes (Supplementary Table

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, outside of the Antarctic region the obliquity values supported by the proxy records are similar to the annual mean values of GCM simulations, or at least not different in a uniform way (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). At low latitudes, the models and proxies both show relatively little sensitivity to obliquity, consistent with the hypothesis that changes in heat transport counteract much of the annual mean insolation forcing at those latitudes. At high latitudes, proxies show some obliquity signal

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>, but there is a consistent mismatch in magnitude between the short-term obliquity response in models and that inferred from Antarctic proxies. Multiple long ice cores show similar responses in Antarctica, so the following analysis focuses on that region rather than Greenland. The Antarctic ice cores support only 24–33% of the fast, direct response to obliquity simulated by CM2.1 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), and 44–88% of the response in CESM (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). This discrepancy presents an intriguing question, and several possible hypotheses to explain the mismatch are outlined below.

  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One possible explanation involves the alignment of the proxy records. As stated earlier, the present analysis draws a distinction between the fast response to insolation forcing, which is captured in the orbital GCM simulations, and the longer-term obliquity response associated with slow feedbacks. If the age models are not correctly aligned, the comparison may suffer. The possibility is further explored using spectral analysis (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second possible explanation for the mismatch is that the models may be too sensitive to obliquity forcing in the Antarctic. This could happen, for instance, if the modeled surface albedo or lapse rate feedbacks are too strong in that region, a negative feedback is absent, or if the southward heat transport from lower latitudes is too weak. The role of heat transport in dampening the Antarctic response to obliquity has been explored in past work using the LOVECLIM Earth system model of intermediate complexity and the MIROC GCM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
   </span>. However, because the temperature response is generally robust across the three models explored in the present work (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), any shortcoming would likely have to be systematic across these models. Additionally, the radiative forcing due to obliquity is large at high latitudes (−5 W m
   <span class="sup">−2</span> in the Antarctic Circle in CM2.1 and CESM), so a large temperature response seems reasonable, provided there is no error in the calculated strength of the orbital cycles. Dust is one possible source of error, as changes of dust
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
   </span> are not included in this methodology. Some GCM simulations suggest that dust has little effect on Antarctic temperatures
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. However, dust may have considerable indirect effects on clouds
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>
   </span>, so the potential impact of dust in the present study is unclear. The mismatch could also stem from differences in the obliquity temperature response at the surface and higher in the atmosphere, where the snow preserved in ice cores forms, but the model results do not seem to support this. However, the discrete and course nature of the models’ vertical grids makes this possibility difficult to evaluate.
  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional possible reason for the mismatch concerns shortcomings of the linear reconstruction methodology. Because the CM2.1 and CESM linear reconstructions are based on idealized single-forcing experiments, where one forcing is applied and all others are prescribed at preindustrial levels, any nonlinearities between multiple forcings are excluded. This may be important, for example, if the climate response to obliquity would be different under glacial boundary conditions, especially since glacials are more common than interglacials during the period of comparison, the Late Quaternary. Hypothetically, a diminished climate response to obliquity during colder conditions could help explain the mismatch. However, an analysis of the Antarctic temperature response to obliquity under a variety of background conditions conducted with a climate emulator using HadCM3 simulations
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
   </span> suggests that the climate response to obliquity is not heavily dependent on ice sheet extent or greenhouse gas concentrations (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> and Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Possible seasonal bias in Antarctic ice cores</div>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another possible explanation for the model–data mismatch involves the seasonal cycle. Obliquity affects high-latitude insolation primarily in the summer months, so the temperature response is larger in summer than in winter, which is subject to polar night. The obliquity signal could be diminished if, for example, the ice cores preferentially record winter more than summer temperature—the relatively small winter temperature anomalies would be preferentially recorded. A seasonal bias would affect the recorded precession signal as well, potentially both in timing and magnitude, because of the seasonal nature of the temperature response to precession. The degree to which a seasonal bias can modify the recorded climate signal has been discussed in past work, and caution should be used when attempting to separate orbital signals which represent the actual climate response from those introduced by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
   </span>. It is worth noting that a seasonal bias would not strongly affect the greenhouse gas and ice sheet signals in Antarctic ice core records because, at least in the models, the temperature responses to ice sheets and greenhouse gases do not vary extensively throughout the year at the ice core sites (Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>, 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Therefore, the temperature response to changes in greenhouse gases or ice sheets, which appear to be the bulk of the signal, should be recorded relatively accurately regardless of any potential seasonal bias, which is beneficial for studies of climate sensitivity. This point is relevant for lagged orbital responses as well. The EPICA Dome C record, for example, has a pronounced obliquity signal, but it lags the obliquity forcing by 5 ka
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>, suggesting the influence of slow feedbacks like ice sheets. Dome Fuji also contains obliquity-scale lags associated with slow feedbacks
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
   </span>. Any temperature response due to these slow feedbacks should be captured in the ice cores, regardless of any potential seasonal bias, because temperature responses due to ice sheets and CO
   <sub>2</sub> are not very seasonal. Only the fast response to obliquity and precession (i.e., the temperature response to radiative forcing plus fast feedbacks) would be very distorted by a seasonal bias in the recording mechanism due to the large seasonality of these responses (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). Because of the largely seasonal nature of obliquity and precession signals, they provide a way to probe potential seasonal biases in long proxy records. In these ice core records, it is the fast, direct obliquity response which might be under-represented.
  </p>
  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calculate whether a seasonally weighted linear reconstruction would better match the proxy temperature records, mismatches are computed between each proxy record and seasonally weighted linear reconstructions (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). A boxcar weighting function is employed to compute the mean over a continuous span expressed in months. Two factors are allowed to vary in this analysis: the center month of the mean and the time spanned by the mean, ranging from one to all twelve months. The general results do not differ substantially if a sinusoidal weighting function is used instead.

  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The improved fit is attributable to two factors. First, the local temperature response to obliquity is reduced in these months, reducing the obliquity signal. Second, this seasonal weighting alters the precession signal to generally be more consistent with precession-scale temperature variability in the proxy record, such as some of the variations in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a–e and 7 (Fig.

   </span>. Another study showed that a seasonal bias could explain why the precession signal in Antarctic ice cores appears to be out of phase with local insolation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. That research focused on the timing of precession variability, and here we show that this explanation helps improve the fit of the obliquity signal as well. Performing the analysis by applying seasonal weighting to the obliquity or precession components alone shows that mismatch is generally reduced in both cases (Supplementary Figs. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>, 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). This provides two separate lines of evidence that Antarctic temperature records may be biased toward winter or spring. Previous work has suggested that the precession signal in Antarctic temperature may be a response to the duration of the summer, which is longer when perihelion occurs at the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. However, this explanation is undermined by the fact that such an orbital configuration produces annual mean cooling rather than warming over most of Antarctica in both the CM2.1 and CESM. Additionally, this explanation would not help explain the obliquity discrepancy.

  <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A seasonal bias in ice cores could result from several factors. In particular, the mean isotopic signature could be biased by preferential snowfall during a particular part of the year. As compiled in previous work (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a> in ref. 
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>), observations from Vostok, Mizuho, and Dome Fuji stations, as well as data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) suggest that Antarctic snowfall is reduced during Antarctic summer, in line with this explanation. This snowfall seasonality is supported by some modeling results
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>, but not by others. In general, it is unclear whether models can simulate Antarctic precipitation accurately enough to be useful for this purpose
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>
   </span>. The importance of seasonal precipitation to the interpretation of ice cores has been previously argued
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>, as well as the potential importance of seasonal sublimation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>. If precipitation is reduced during Antarctic winter instead, it would be evidence against the seasonality argument presented in this paper.
  </p>
  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considerable uncertainties still surround the topic of isotopic signatures in ice cores. In addition to seasonal variations, covariance between temperature and precipitation on synoptic timescales has the potential to affect isotopic ratios, which could be troublesome if these relationships change over time, although this effect may be less important for the interior of East Antarctica than for more coastal regions

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
   </span>. Other influences on isotopic composition could stem from changes in the temperature and source of evaporated moisture, regional changes in ice sheet elevation, changes in lapse rate, and more

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. Investigating all of these factors is beyond the scope of the present analysis. We focus on the potential impact of a seasonal bias because it is the most straightforward explanation for the apparent model/data temperature discrepancy presented here, but other explanations are certainly possible.
