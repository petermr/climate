      <p>The authors would like to thank J. Shakun for his data set of proxy-derived temperatures
         aligned to LR04, V. Masson–Delmotte for suggestions about past ice core research,
         and F. Parrenin for the Vostok temperature reconstruction data. M.P.E. was supported
         by a postdoctoral fellowship from the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics
         and a grant from the Paleo Perspective on Climate Change program of the National Science
         Foundation (Grant ATM0902735), as well as support from the University of Southern
         California and Northern Arizona University. This work was partially funded under the
         State of Arizona Technology and Research Initiative Fund (TRIF), administered by the
         Arizona Board of Regents. The authors would also like to thank the NOAA Geophysical
         Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) at Princeton, the National Center for Atmospheric
         Research (NCAR) and the Computational &amp; Information Systems Lab (CISL), and the Hadley
         Center for computational resources to complete these simulations.
