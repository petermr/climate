  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">QRA Fingerprint</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the QRA detection scheme of Kornhuber 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a> but in this case applied it to near-surface temperature rather than upper level winds, to develop a zonal mean QRA temperature fingerprint. We used the Jun-Aug (JJA) 1979–2015 ERA interim reanalysis (2.5° × 2.5°). Near-surface atmospheric temperature profiles were calculated using z = 1000 mb daily data over the full Northern Hemisphere (0°N–90°N) in 37 steps (2.5°). We focused on long duration (≥10 days) wavenumber 7 events to define QRA-favorable time intervals, and confined zonal-mean profiles to the mid-latitude latitude range (25N–75N) analyzed in previous work
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>. Such events have been shown to be closely related to Northern Hemisphere JJA heat extremes
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. The fingerprint was interpolated to a 5° latitude grid that is consistent with the grid of the model simulations and observational datas (see below) and centered on zero. This yields an 11 element zero-centered row vector that defines the QRA fingerprint.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projection of the fingerprint was estimated in both CMIP5 simulated (see below) and observational (see below) datasets through linear regression of the 11 element row vectors defined by the individual yearly (JJA) model or observational zonal mean surface temperatures onto the QRA fingerprint defined above.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 Historical Simulations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical experiment
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a> multimodel ensemble simulations, including both the anthropogenic+natural forced simulations (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 164 realizations; 
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 48 models) and anthropogenic-only forced simulations (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 40 realizations; 
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 10 models) spanning 1861–2005 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S1</a>). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (1861–2005). Those with a start year later than 1861 were not included in the analysis.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5° interval.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational Surface Temperatures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed zonal mean boreal summer (JJA) average temperatures (Surface Air Temperature over land and Sea Surface Temperature over oceans) using each of three alternative datasets: GISTEMP
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a> (1880–2015), HadCRUT4
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a> (1894–2015) and Cowtan &amp; Way
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a> (1894–2015). These three different datasets make alternative assumptions about how to account for historical data gaps, which is particularly important in the Arctic region that is key to this study, due to the large spatial gaps in this region coupled with the amplified high-latitude warming in the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades. The time period of analysis was constrained by continuous data availability for each latitude band. For example, the HadCRUT4 and Cowtan &amp; Way datasets contain at least one grid cell temperature value in each latitude band across the range of interest (25–75N) from 1894 to present. Accordingly, the grid cell coverage is relatively sparse in the early segments of the records and increases toward present day.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with the model output, we used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5° interval.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trend Assessment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear trends for both simulations and observations were computed based on ordinary least squares (OLS) using the post-1970 interval of dominant anthropogenic forcing.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the observational series, trends were calculated both for the 1970–2005 (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 36) interval of overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations, and for the longer 1970–2015 (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 46 years) updated to include the most recent decade of observations. In both cases, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values were assessed by taking into account reduced degrees of freedom owing to serial correlation of regression residuals via 
   <span class="italic">N</span>’ = 
   <span class="italic">N</span>(1 − 
   <span class="italic">ρ</span>)/(1 + 
   <span class="italic">ρ</span>) where 
   <span class="italic">ρ</span> is the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient of the actual series (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the CMIP5 multimodel mean all-forcing and anthropogenic-only series, trends over 1970–2005 (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 36) and statistical significance were assessed as described above.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also diagnosed trends for the full CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assessing the +/−1 sigma range (or more precisely, the 16%ile and 84%ile of the distribution, which is slightly asymmetric with respect to the mean) across the ensemble as reported in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>. We also calculated, as a measure of robustness across the multi-model ensemble, the percent of ensemble members (“% &gt; 0” in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) with positive trends and performed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 realizations) modeling each multi-model ensemble member fingerprint series as AR(1) red noise (preserving the standard deviation and lag-one autocorrelation of the series). Using the distribution among the Monte Carlo surrogates of the 1970–2005 trends across the multimodel ensemble, we then assessed 
   <span class="italic">p</span> values for the “% &gt; 0” statistic (the minimum possible 
   <span class="italic">p</span> value calculable using 10,000 surrogates is 10
   <span class="sup">−4</span>).
