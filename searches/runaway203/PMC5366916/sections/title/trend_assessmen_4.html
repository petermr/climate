      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linear trends for both simulations and observations were computed based on ordinary
         least squares (OLS) using the post-1970 interval of dominant anthropogenic forcing.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the observational series, trends were calculated both for the 1970–2005 (
         <span>N</span> = 36) interval of overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations, and for the longer
         1970–2015 (
         <span>N</span> = 46 years) updated to include the most recent decade of observations. In both cases,
         
         <span>p</span> values were assessed by taking into account reduced degrees of freedom owing to serial
         correlation of regression residuals via 
         <span>N</span>’ = 
         <span>N</span>(1 − 
         <span>ρ</span>)/(1 + 
         <span>ρ</span>) where 
         <span>ρ</span> is the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient of the actual series (
         <a>Table 1</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the CMIP5 multimodel mean all-forcing and anthropogenic-only series, trends over
         1970–2005 (
         <span>N</span> = 36) and statistical significance were assessed as described above.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also diagnosed trends for the full CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assessing the +/−1
         sigma range (or more precisely, the 16%ile and 84%ile of the distribution, which is
         slightly asymmetric with respect to the mean) across the ensemble as reported in 
         <a>Table 1</a>. We also calculated, as a measure of robustness across the multi-model ensemble,
         the percent of ensemble members (“% &gt; 0” in 
         <a>Table 1</a>) with positive trends and performed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 realizations)
         modeling each multi-model ensemble member fingerprint series as AR(1) red noise (preserving
         the standard deviation and lag-one autocorrelation of the series). Using the distribution
         among the Monte Carlo surrogates of the 1970–2005 trends across the multimodel ensemble,
         we then assessed 
         <span>p</span> values for the “% &gt; 0” statistic (the minimum possible 
         <span>p</span> value calculable using 10,000 surrogates is 10
         <span>−4</span>).
