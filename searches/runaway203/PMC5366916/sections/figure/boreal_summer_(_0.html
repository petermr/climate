         <p>Shown are (

            mean and QRA-favorable conditions (at 2.5° latitudinal resolution), (

            associated with QRA-favorable conditions, (

            region 25–75N, centered on zero, and interpolated onto 5° latitudinal grid commensurate
            with model simultions, and (
