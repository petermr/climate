      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results suggest that the Holocene conundrum can be contributed significantly by
         biases in both data and model. Some temperature proxies have summer biases, while
         the models may have neglected the reduced mineral dust in the early to mid-Holocene.
         Our study remains preliminary. One large uncertainty in our study is the neglect of
         the indirect radiative effect of mineral dust aerosol. Part of the reason we didn’t
         include this is that the indirect effect has a very large uncertainty in current estimations
         <span><a>32</a></span>. Nevertheless, if we use an additional warming effect of 0.30 W m
         <span>−2</span> (the difference in Net Effective Radiative Forcing between the two LD cases in Table 
         <a>2</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
         <span><a>33</a></span>) due to indirect dust radiative forcing for a 90% reduction of dust loading (Table 
         <a>S1</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
         <span><a>33</a></span>), and assume it scales linearly with different fractions of dust reduction, the MH
         climate could warm by an additional 0.09 °C with a 60% dust reduction. This number
         is obtained based on the assumption that a 0.68 W m
         <span>−2</span> forcing causes a global warming of 0.3 °C as described above. Therefore, the total
         warming would be 0.27 °C (or 0.23 °C if the more precise value for the 60% dust reduction
         is used, see the paragraph above) even with a 60% reduction of dust. Note that the
         estimated dust indirect radiative effect in Sagoo and Storelvmo
         <span><a>30</a></span> extends in a certain range, which is attributed to the subtleties in ice cloud formation
         scheme and cloud feedbacks on climate in the global model (e.g., Table 
         <a>S2</a> of Sagoo and Storelvmo
         <span><a>30</a></span>). The effect is too complicated to discuss here, but is of significance for future
         studies.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, for clarity, we only focused on the dust effect alone; the change of vegetation
         and lake levels are not considered. In experiments in which the North Africa is changed
         to grassland, the change of global-mean surface temperature of MH (EH) due to complete
         removal of dust is 0.26 °C (0.23 °C), almost the same as in the dust-only experiments
         described above, with also similar response pattern (see Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>8</a>). Therefore, the vegetation effect itself appears to be not significant relative
         to the associated dust effect in this model.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, models have biases and uncertainties, and uncertainty in the radiative effect
         of dust is not small
         <span><a>32</a>,
            <a>34</a></span>. Especially, a recent study argued that the direct radiative forcing of dust should
         be lower than previously expected
         <span><a>35</a></span>. But it is possible that their results were biased due to their assumptions of spherical
         shape, constant mixing state and optical properties of dust
         <span><a>36</a></span>. Therefore, much work is awaited to determine the radiative effect of dust. A multi-model
         experiments will also be needed in the future to assess the robustness of the dust
         effect on the HTM climate. Overall, our study highlights the dust effect as a potentially
         important factor for understanding climate changes in the past and future. The identification
         of the model-data discrepancy is improving our understanding of both the model and
         data.
