      <p>Climate models generally fail to produce a warmer (by as much as 0.5 °C) early to
         mid-Holocene than the pre-industrial in the global annual temperature, which has been
         termed the Holocene temperature conundrum. Here we use a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean
         general circulation model to test whether the conundrum can be partially resolved
         by considering the fact that atmospheric dust loading was much reduced during the
         early to mid-Holocene. Our experiments show that the global annual mean surface temperature
         increases by 0.30 °C and 0.23 °C for the mid-Holocene (6 ka) and early Holocene (9
         ka), respectively, if the dust is completely removed. The temperature increase scales
         almost linearly with the fraction of dust being removed, with the 50% dust reduction
         experiment for the 6 ka being the only one deviating from the linear trend. The indirect
         effect of dust, which is highly uncertain and is not included in the model, may further
         enhance the warming. Therefore, the neglect of dust reduction in the Holocene in climate
         models could contribute significantly to the model-data discrepancy, especially in
         the Northern Hemisphere.
