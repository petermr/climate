            <span>a</span>) Shows the temporal spectrum of the global-mean TSI, (

            <span>c</span>) the temporal spectrum of the global-mean OLR and (
            <span>d</span>) the temporal spectrum of the global-mean precipitation of the simulation with a
            semimajor axis of the planetary orbit around Kepler-35 AB of 1.165 a.u. The horizontal
            axes denote the period in days and 
            <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> indicates the period of the binary orbit as seen from the planet and 
            <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> the period of the planetary orbit. The temporal spectrum was taken over 10,800 Earth-days
            in steady state.
