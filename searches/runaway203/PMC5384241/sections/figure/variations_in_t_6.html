         <div>Variations in TSI and gST due to the oscillation of the eccentricity of the planetary
            orbit.

         <p>(
            <span>a</span>) Shows the monthly mean of global-mean TSI as a function of time in the simulations
            with a semimajor axis of the binary orbit of 0.25 a.u. for a period of 43,200 Earth-days
            in steady state. A month counts 30 Earth-days. The downward spikes in the TSI are
            caused by stellar eclipses. (
            <span>b</span>) Shows a time-slice of 700 Earth-days of global-mean TSI and of gST when the eccentricity
            of the planetary orbit and hence the variations are large and (
            <span>c</span>) a time-slice of 700 Earth-days when the eccentricity is small. Note that for (
            <span>b</span>) the planet is not yet in steady state.
