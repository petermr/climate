  <p>Amplitudes of the TSI (
   <span class="bold">a</span>), of the surface temperature (
   <span class="bold">b</span>), of the OLR (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) and of the total precipitation (
   <span class="bold">d</span>) for the binary period 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and for the planetary period 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub>. Circles denote the amplitudes of the global-mean quantities (s.g.m.) for the two periods and the triangles denote the global-mean of the amplitudes of the zonal-mean quantities (g.m.z.s.). The experiments are from left to right the one with a planetary semi-major axis of 1.140 a.u. (yellow), of 1.165 a.u. (red), 1.195 a.u. (magenta) and 1.225 (blue). The grey and the black marks denote the experiment in which the semimajor axis of the binary orbit is increased to 0.25 a.u. in a 10,800-Earth-day period of high planetary eccentricity (grey) and low planetary eccentricity (black). The marks are arranged in two groups: The left group shows the amplitudes with respect to 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and the right group shows the amplitude with respect to 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub>. Note that the horizontal separation within the two groups only serves the purpose of clarity and does not correspond to the small differences in 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>B</sub> and 
   <span class="italic">O</span>
   <sub>P</sub> across simulations.
