      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have considered several initial starting positions for the planet at distances
         of 1.140, 1.165, 1.195 and 1.225 a.u. from the binary stars' centre of mass. The masses
         and properties of the binary system are taken from the Supplementary Table 1 in ref.
         
         <a>1</a> (
         <a>Table 2</a>). An additional simulation was performed in which the semimajor axis of the binary
         orbit was increased from 0.176 to 0.250 a.u. for a planetary semimajor axis of 1.175 a.u.
         Two additional simulations were performed in which the spectra of the stars were replaced
         by the spectrum of our sun. The semimajor axis of the planet in these simulations
         was set to be 1.165 and 1.195 a.u. respectively. Four additional simulations were
         performed to assess the region where the same aquaplanet could maintain habitable
         states with a perfectly circular orbit around our sun. The semimajor axis of the planet
         in these simulations was set to be 0.975, 1.000, 1.025 and 1.050 a.u. respectively.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The obliquity of the planet was 0° in all simulations and its mass, radius and rotation
         period were equal to that of Earth (
         <a>Table 2</a>). Simulations run until a habitable quasi-equilibrium persisted for 10,800 Earth-days.
