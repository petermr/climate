      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to capture the different responses of the gST, the global-mean precipitation
         and the OLR, we introduce a simple analytic model which can qualitatively explain
         our results, at least in the same reference climate. We then use the model as a basis
         to discuss more complex aspects of the climate response to periodic forcings. Similar
         types of models have been used to describe thermally heated slab-oceans
         <a>28</a><a>29</a><a>30</a><a>31</a>. The model equations are introduced and solved in the methods section. In the following
         we use the solutions for the amplitude and the lag to discuss some of our results.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can we understand the influence of 
         <span>ω</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> and 
         <span>α</span> on the amplitude and lag of the solution? The parameter 
         <span>α</span> describes how strongly the system restores to a steady state from a forcing. If 
         <span>α</span> is very large, a small change in the forced quantity suffices to restore the imbalance
         caused by a forcing (
         <a>equation (2)</a>) and the response will not lag the forcing substantially, because the system quickly
         readjusts. If 
         <span>α</span> on the other hand is zero, the system does not restore to a steady state by itself,
         but only maintains a steady state, because the forcing is zero on average over one
         period in a steady state. In this case the amplitude only depends on the time it takes
         for the system to change sign and on the forcing amplitude. Since the time elapsed
         between the forcing reaching the maximum and the forcing changing sign is exactly
         a quarter forcing period, the lag in this case will also be a quarter period. The
         amplitude of the forced quantity decreases with 
         <span>ω</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> and hence increases with the forcing period, because the system has more time to
         readjust to the forcing through feedback mechanisms. The lag of the forced quantity
         decreases with 
         <span>ω</span><sub><span>k</span></sub>, because an oscillation of longer period takes more time to complete one period.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our particular case, the two considered modes are 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. For our planet in the Kepler-35 system, the forcing 
         <span>F</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> is, for instance, the change in global-mean TSI. For our planet with a semimajor
         axis of 1.165 a.u., the forcing from 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> has a larger amplitude but shorter period than 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. Since the amplitude of the response increases both with amplitude and period of
         the forcing (
         <a>equation (2)</a>), the amplitude of the response can be larger for either of the two modes, depending
         on the two parameters 
         <span>α</span> and 
         <span>β</span> (
         <a>Fig. 6a,b</a>). If 
         <span>α</span> is large compared to the frequencies in the considered range of frequencies, 
         <span>L</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> depends only weakly on the frequency (
         <a>equation (1)</a>, 
         <a>Fig. 6a,b</a>). If in contrast 
         <span>α</span> is small compared to frequencies in the considered range, then 
         <span>L</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> depends strongly on the frequency. If the gST is taken as 
         <span>L</span><sub><span>k</span></sub>, our results suggest 
         <span>α</span> (=2.61 × 10
         <span>−2</span> day
         <span>−1</span>) to be on the order of magnitude of the frequency corresponding to 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 6a</a>). Since the frequency corresponding to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is 16 times as large as that corresponding to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>, 
         <span>α</span> is small in our case. Therefore, the dependence of the gST on the frequency is strong.
         This explains why the amplitude of gST is larger for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. If we identify 
         <span>L</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> with the global-mean precipitations then 
         <span>α</span> (=2.31 × 10
         <span>−1</span> day
         <span>−1</span>) is of the order magnitude of the frequency corresponding to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 6b</a>) and 
         <span>α</span> is large in our range of frequencies. In this case the dependence of 
         <span>L</span><sub><span>k</span></sub> on frequency is weaker than for the gST and even though 
         <span>β</span> is smaller than in the case of the gST, the amplitude of the global-mean precipitation
         is larger for the shorter period associated to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to illustrate how changes in magnitude and period of the forcing influence
         the response of the aforementioned quantities, we performed an additional simulation
         in which the semimajor axis of the binary orbit is increased from 0.176 to 0.250 a.u.
         As a consequence, both the period and the amplitude of the forcing from 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> increase. Since the planet then would have a higher mean TSI, we moved the planet
         to a semimajor axis of 1.175 a.u., such that the mean TSI is approximately 1.0 
         <span>S</span><sub>0</sub> (
         <a>Table 1</a>). The increase of the semimajor axis of the binary leads to an increased oscillation
         of the eccentricity of the planetary orbit with a period of around 100 (Earth-) years
         (
         <a>Fig. 7</a>). This causes substantial changes in the forcing coming from 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>, with an amplitude of around 4 W m
         <span>−2</span> in the 10,800-day average when the eccentricity is small (approximately 0.01), to
         around 15 W m
         <span>−2</span> when the eccentricity is large (approximately 0.023) (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). When the eccentricity is small, the amplitude of gST, precipitation and OLR from
         
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is similar or smaller than in the simulations with a semimajor axis of the binary
         of 0.176 a.u. In particular, 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> increases relative to 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. When the eccentricity is large, the amplitude of gST, precipitation and OLR from
         
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> are all considerably larger (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). In the temporal average over a 100-year period (not shown), the amplitude of gST
         from 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is still larger than that from 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>, but the difference is considerably smaller than for a semimajor axis of the binary
         of 0.176 a.u. Hence, the influence of 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> on the climate relative to 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is increasing with increasing semimajor axis of the binary. Since both the period
         and the amplitude of TSI from 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> increase, this is in agreement with 
         <a>equation (2)</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The feedback-model works well to explain how the amplitude of different forced quantities
         behave, but the model becomes inaccurate when quantitative predictions are required
         for various reasons. The linear feedback parameter 
         <span>α</span>, for instance, can depend on time. This is indeed the case in our simulations as
         is easily illustrated when calculating the lag of the solution for the gST using 
         <a>equation (4)</a>. By applying our 3D-model results for each 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> separately to 
         <a>equation (1)</a>, we can solve the resulting system of two equations for 
         <span>α</span>. The Feedback-model overestimates the lag for 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and underestimates the lag for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 6c</a>) for our habitable planet, when gST is the forced quantity. This suggests that 
         <span>α</span> and thus the response of the gST depends on the time scale and hence on the period
         of the forcing and that 
         <span>α</span> is decreasing with the period in our particular case. Several studies of present-day
         and future climate change suggest indeed that the feedback parameter is time dependent
         in transient simulations
         <a>32</a><a>33</a><a>34</a>. Our 
         <span>α</span> with respect to gST is comparable to the climate feedback parameter divided by the
         specific heat-capacity and by one minus the Bond albedo in climate change experiments,
         and thus corresponds to the adjustment time-scale of the climate. The feedback parameter
         is commonly evaluated in climate change experiments by making a linear regression
         to the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance as a function of the change in surface
         temperature, once the model has run into the new steady state. The linear regression
         can, however, be performed over shorter time periods and that may yield temporally
         variable feedback parameters. In the first months after a forcing is applied, the
         feedback parameter and thus 
         <span>α</span> are known to change due to fast adjustments
         <a>35</a>. In fact, the feedback parameter decreases in most climate models that took part
         in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (ref. 
         <a>36</a>). Therefore, 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> with only 22 days is likely too short to justify the assumption that 
         <span>α</span> is constant. With roughly 360 days, 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> is more likely to be in a regime in which 
         <span>α</span> changes little. Note that calculating the precipitation lag from the simple model
         presented in 
         <a>equation (4)</a> seems to provide even less reliable results for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> (
         <a>Fig. 6d</a>) than the gST lag, since the phase shift exceeds a quarter of the corresponding period.
         This indicates that either 
         <span>β</span> is negative or that the precipitation does not directly depend on TSI.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variations in gST are substantially larger over ice covered surfaces. Ice has
         only around half the specific heat capacity of liquid water, and since both 
         <span>α</span> and 
         <span>β</span> are inversely proportional to the heat capacity, the amplitude according to our analytical
         model increases with decreasing heat capacity. This difference in thermal inertia
         between ice-covered and water-covered surfaces also explains why the contribution
         from low-latitudes to the amplitude of gST is much larger for 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> than for 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub>: 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> is simply too short to cause a change in the surface-temperature of water. The slower
         response of the open water areas due to the larger thermal inertia of liquid water
         compared to ice is even further amplified by the larger amount of water vapour in
         the atmosphere in warmer climates. The atmospheric water vapour increases the thermal
         inertia of the atmosphere through storage of latent-heat in the atmosphere and by
         reducing the clear-sky cooling to space through its greenhouse effect. Furthermore,
         areas of open water are more efficient at mitigating radiative imbalances at the surface
         through changes in the latent-heat flux. At longer time-scales, the smaller Planck-
         and lapse-rate-feedbacks at lower surface temperature may also contribute to larger
         amplitudes in gST over ice-covered areas, as has been found in present-day Earth climate-change
         simulations
         <a>37</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate of a planet in the Kepler-35 system tends to be cooler than the one in
         our own solar system in cold states. This could be due to the difference in albedo
         caused by the different spectra of the solar irradiation in the two systems. To test
         this hypothesis, we perform two more simulations of the planet in the Kepler-35 system
         with a semimajor axis of 1.165 a.u. and with a semimajor axis of 1.195 a.u. of the
         planetary orbit, but replace the spectral distribution of the two stars by that of
         our sun. This means that the planet experiences the variations in TSI due to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>, but the solar spectra correspond to that of our own sun. We find no substantial
         change in gST (
         <a>Table 1</a>) in the simulation with 1.165 a.u. and a slight warming in the simulation with 1.195 a.u.
         However, the gST for the circumbinary planet with 1.195 a.u. is still lower than for
         an Earth-like planet with comparable but slightly lower TSI in our solar system. Therefore,
         the cooler climate in the Kepler-35 system must be at least partly due to different
         processes. We hypothesize here that one of the causes for the cooling is the fact
         that the black-body emission increases faster than linearly. If we assume two planets
         with the same average temperature (and no atmosphere to start with), but only one
         experiencing oscillations in gST, the planet with the oscillation in gST will emit
         more thermal radiation than the one without oscillations and, therefore, cool. If
         our hypothesis is true, this could more strongly affect cold states, because the temperature
         variations are large and because the direct contribution of the surface to the OLR
         is large. This is indeed seen in our simulations. In warm states on the other hand
         the oscillations in surface temperature should have a much smaller influence on the
         OLR, because of the larger opacity of the denser atmosphere, which also appears to
         be consistent with our results. However, in the warmer climates, feedback mechanisms
         are more complex and a deeper study of these mechanisms is necessary.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Periodic variations in TSI can have a variety of causes that do not necessarily require
         multiple stars. The most studied case is the effect of the 11-year solar cycle on
         present-day Earth. Owing to the relatively small magnitude of the solar cycle amplitude
         (around 0.6 W m
         <span>−2</span>), modelling studies suggest that the effects are relatively small, but still clearly
         visible even at the surface owing to the relatively long period
         <a>38</a><a>39</a>. As in our case, surface-responses tend to be lagged owing to the thermal inertia
         of the oceans. Another common case in which planets receive periodically changing
         amounts of sunlight is non-zero orbital eccentricity in single-star systems. Increased
         eccentricity was shown to tend to warm Earth-like planets with present-day Earth rotation
         as both an effect of increased annual-mean insolation
         <a>40</a><a>41</a> and changes in insolation for fixed annual mean solar insolation
         <a>40</a>. For tidally locked planets, increasing the eccentricity can warm or cool the planet
         depending on several factors
         <a>42</a>, suggesting a complex climate response to the variable insolation. As in our study,
         the climate response in these studies is complex and the full extent of the climate
         response to periodic forcing on Earth-like planets is still to be understood.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, using a state-of-the-art GCM we have demonstrated that the habitable
         climates of an Earth-like planet with present-day-Earth CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentrations in the binary-star system Kepler-35 are confined to a region around
         a distance of 1.165–1.195 a.u. with respect to the centre of gravity of the system.
         Although this is situated beyond the Earth's current orbit around the sun, its extent
         is similar to what we would expect for the same planet in our solar system. Periodic
         variations of TSI caused by the changing orbit of a planet around the two stars and
         by the orbit of the stars around the common centre of mass have a variety of impacts
         on the variations of the climate, but lead only to relatively small changes in the
         mean climate. The magnitude of the climate response does not only depend on the amplitude
         of the TSI, but also on the efficacy of the forcing in influencing the considered
         quantity, on the feedback parameter of that quantity and on the period of the forcing.
         For similar mean TSI, the magnitude of the impact of the variations of TSI will increase
         with the semimajor axis of the binary system, as both the amplitude and the period
         of the TSI grow. We have furthermore demonstrated that the linear feedback parameter
         is most likely time dependent. The global-mean of the amplitude of a zonal-mean quantity,
         such as precipitation or OLR, can be substantially larger than the amplitude of the
         global-mean quantity, implying that observers at a distance may have difficulties
         in estimating the variability of said quantities accurately. This means that, even-though
         double-star systems similar to the one studied here seem to be good candidates for
         habitable planets, the interpretation of observations of such planets is bound to
         be challenging. A detailed understanding of the underlying climate dynamics will be
         crucial for a correct interpretation of observations.
