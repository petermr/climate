      <p>Amplitudes of the TSI (
         <span>a</span>), of the surface temperature (
         <span>b</span>), of the OLR (
         <span>c</span>) and of the total precipitation (
         <span>d</span>) for the binary period 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and for the planetary period 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. Circles denote the amplitudes of the global-mean quantities (s.g.m.) for the two
         periods and the triangles denote the global-mean of the amplitudes of the zonal-mean
         quantities (g.m.z.s.). The experiments are from left to right the one with a planetary
         semi-major axis of 1.140 a.u. (yellow), of 1.165 a.u. (red), 1.195 a.u. (magenta)
         and 1.225 (blue). The grey and the black marks denote the experiment in which the
         semimajor axis of the binary orbit is increased to 0.25 a.u. in a 10,800-Earth-day
         period of high planetary eccentricity (grey) and low planetary eccentricity (black).
         The marks are arranged in two groups: The left group shows the amplitudes with respect
         to 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and the right group shows the amplitude with respect to 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub>. Note that the horizontal separation within the two groups only serves the purpose
         of clarity and does not correspond to the small differences in 
         <span>O</span><sub>B</sub> and 
         <span>O</span><sub>P</sub> across simulations.
