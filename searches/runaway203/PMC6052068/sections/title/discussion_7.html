      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to be confident in model predictions, it is critical to quantify the impact
         of various sources of uncertainty on palaeo ice-sheet reconstructions. The quantification
         of uncertainty introduced by the choice of climate model or ISM used has been the
         primary goal of the PLISMIP project presented here and in previous papers
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>40</a>,
            <a>41</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results indicate a high level of climate model dependency in reconstructing the
         Antarctic ice-sheet volume (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>) and resulting sea level change (Fig. 
         <a>7</a>). Given the complex nature of the PlioMIP1 climate models used to provide our forcing
         fields, understanding the reasons for differences in the ISM predictions is non-trivial.
         It is clear that some of the major variations in the simulated extent and volume of
         the AIS for the Pliocene scenarios are closely linked to the way temperature, precipitation
         and ocean temperatures are predicted among the climate models. Warming among the PlioMIP1
         climate models in the Antarctic region has been previously attributed to the changes
         in the cryosphere and surface albedo
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Over Antarctica, the clear sky albedo is the dominant component of the energy balance,
         which leads to increased warming in all PlioMIP models south of 75°S (although there
         is a large range in warming at 90°S (1.5–12 °C))
         <span><a>42</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difference in the results from the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> ensemble (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>) and the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> ensemble (Fig. 
         <a>6</a>) also shows the level to which the equilibrium ice-sheet predictions are dependent
         upon the history of the ice-sheet system (hysteresis); in this case, the specific
         initial conditions used in the ISM set-up. This is most clearly demonstrated in the
         results using ANICE and SICOPOLIS driven by the CCSM4 climate model. CCSM4 exhibits
         some of the coldest sub-shelf ocean temperatures, especially over the Ross Ice Shelf
         (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>3</a>), and has the coldest temperatures (~−25 °C) over West Antarctica of the considered
         PlioMIP models (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). This may be in part due to the higher albedo levels in CCSM4 (
         <span>α</span> = ~0.6) over West Antarctica relative to the other GCMs helping to promote cooling.
         In the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> simulation, the precipitation rates over West Antarctica are not sufficient to create
         a strong positive SMB (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>), thus the results from CCSM4 are in line with the other GCMs (in that the Pliocene
         WAIS remains collapsed from the initial PRISM3 starting configuration; Fig. 
         <a>5</a>). However, when the ISMs are initialised with a modern AIS (Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub>; Fig. 
         <a>6</a>), hysteresis is strong due to the fact that the combination of lapse-rate corrected
         temperatures that are applied and ocean-driven melting are not sufficient to cause
         a reduction of the WAIS and associated retreat of the ice shelves in either ISM.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As we have shown a broad spread in sea level changes associated with our ensemble
         of AIS predictions (Fig. 
         <a>7d</a>), it is useful to understand how these compare to sea level data and also other modelling
         studies for the mPWP in order to assess which of a number of sources of uncertainty
         lead to the largest range in predictions of the AIS (Table 
         <a>1</a>). The results presented here indicate that the spread in sea level change predictions
         for the mPWP from the PlioMIP ensemble (based on the difference to the modern volume)
         using the SIA-SSA models is between 2.24 m s.e. (ANICE with HadCM3) and 14.57 m s.e.
         (SICOPOLIS with IPSLCM5A) for the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> scenario (the mean is 7.79 m s.e.). Using just the ANICE ISM, the range in sea level
         change predictions is 7.04 m s.e. for the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> simulations, and for the SICOPOLIS ISM the range is slightly larger (11.64 m s.e.;
         Fig. 
         <a>7d</a>). However, the average difference between the predictions of the two SSA–SIA ISMs
         using one climate model forcing is only 4.35 m s.e., which shows that the results
         are more dependent upon the chosen climate model forcing and not the ISM used. However,
         both have an impact on the determined result. The range in mean sea level change predicted
         here in both of our Pliocene scenarios is 14.57 to −3.99 m s.e. using only SIA-SSA
         ISMs. This demonstrates that the choice of initial conditions imposed in the ISMs
         is an important control on the total range of sea level predictions, as demonstrated
         previously
         <span><a>28</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focussing primarily on studies employing SIA-SSA models, Table 
         <a>1</a> provides a summary of previous work assessing various sources of uncertainty in predicting
         the Pliocene AIS (see also ref. 
         <span><a>16</a></span>). Following a similar experimental design to that presented here and initialising
         from a PRISM3 ice-sheet, ref. 
         <span><a>28</a></span> predicted a range in mean sea level rise for equilibrium Pliocene ice-sheets of 5.83 m
         s.e. (7.96–13.79 m s.e.) when considering six different SIA-SSA ISMs but only one
         climate model forcing (HadCM3). The comparable range shown here incorporating five
         different GCMs is 12.33 m s.e., supporting the conclusion that climate model dependency
         on AIS predictions for the Pliocene is high.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yan et al. perturbed ISM parameterisations (positive degree-day (PDD) factors for
         ice and snow, enhancement flow factors for the SIA and SSA velocities and the sub-shelf
         melt parameter) using the Parallel ISM (PISM) driven by climatological forcing from
         the NorESM climate model
         <span><a>43</a></span>. They simulated AIS configurations ranging from −4.2 to 6.6 m s.e. volume (causing
         a 10.8 m s.e. variation due to parameter uncertainty). In the same study, temperature
         and precipitation were also increased in steps of 1 °C for temperature and 5.1% increase
         in precipitation per degree of temperature change in order to explore the influence
         of uncertainty in the Pliocene climate forcing on the modelled AIS. Considering this
         additional warming, the mass loss of the AIS relates to a global mean sea level rise
         of 6.2–13.0 m relative to present day (range of 6.8 m s.e.; ref. 
         <span><a>43</a></span>). The impact of uncertainties in dynamic topography
         <span><a>44</a></span> and Antarctic bedrock topography
         <span><a>45</a></span> have also been considered in a Pliocene ISM framework, however, these mechanisms
         only cause a small variation in predicted AIS volume and hence mean sea level change
         (Table 
         <a>1</a>). Therefore, it is clear from our results that in terms of the range of predictions
         of global mean sea level change, the climate model chosen has the potential to exert
         a larger influence on the results than the ISM, ISM parameterisations or changes in
         topography.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While ideally proxy-based estimates of global mean sea level change for the mPWP could
         be used to constrain which of the modelled AIS scenarios is more or less likely, significant
         uncertainty remains in the estimates of Pliocene sea level high stands
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>46</a></span>. Although in general all data suggest a higher-than-present sea level indicative
         of a reduced Greenland ice-sheet and retreated AIS
         <span><a>10</a>,
            <a>12</a></span>, estimates range from between 10 and 30 m above present-day
         <span><a>4</a>–
            <a>8</a></span>, based on a range of global proxy records (e.g. palaeoshorelines), for which the
         largest uncertainties arise from considering processes such as mantle convection and
         glacial isostatic adjustment
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>5</a>,
            <a>9</a>,
            <a>47</a></span>. Recent studies inferring sea level changes from oxygen isotopes have offered a more
         constrained reconstruction of Pliocene sea level, suggesting that high-stands were
         between 9 and 13.5 m above modern, implying that the EAIS may be less sensitive during
         the Pliocene than previously considered
         <span><a>48</a></span>. A further study using a novel approach to constrain mPWP sea level high stands by
         assessing whether or not particular AIS configurations are consistent with the oxygen
         isotope record have suggested that AIS contribution to mPWP sea level rise was at
         most ~13 m
         <span><a>46</a></span>. However, a recent review
         <span><a>49</a></span> of the sources of uncertainty associated with using marine geochemical proxies to
         infer past changes in sea level (e.g. refs. 
         <span><a>46</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>), has shown that diagenesis and potential long-term changes in seawater chemistry
         likely have large and poorly constrained effects on interpretations of such records.
         This may limit their ability to make meaningful Pliocene sea level estimates at the
         present time
         <span><a>49</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The question as to whether or not the EAIS was dynamic or reduced in the Pliocene
         is a long-standing issue (see ref. 
         <span><a>19</a></span>). Our results show that in around 40% of the simulations for the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PRISM3</sub> experiment, substantial ice-sheet reduction is exhibited in the Wilkes and Aurora
         SGB and around Wilkes Land (Figs. 
         <a>3e</a> and 
         <a>4</a>). This is consistent with ice-rafted debris data thought to be indicative of a dynamic
         Wilkes Land margin region during the Late Pliocene
         <span><a>12</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. However, this result depends on the boundary conditions imposed in the climate model
         <span><a>28</a></span> and the starting conditions of the ISMs. For example, none of the AIS configurations
         presented in the Pliocene
         <sub>Ice-PD</sub> experiments suggest significant retreat into the EAIS SGBs (Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). It must be acknowledged that this is potentially inconsistent with geological proxy
         evidence for retreat of portions of the EAIS during the mPWP (e.g. ref. 
         <span><a>12</a></span>). Nevertheless, the results presented here also demonstrate that, while the total
         AIS volume is most heavily influenced by the choice of climate model, detailed predictions
         of areal extent are more likely to be influenced by the ISM used and ISM initial conditions
         (Figs. 
         <a>5</a> and 
         <a>6</a>). For example, Fig. 
         <a>5</a> shows that ANICE predictions generally would lead to the conclusion that the Aurora
         SGB was covered in ice (apart from when using IPSL-CM5A climate forcing), BASISM predictions
         always suggest an ice-covered region, whereas SICOPOLIS predicts some ice retreat
         under all climatologies.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also additional sources of uncertainty that have been shown previously to
         impact upon the details of predicted SGB retreat that have not been considered here.
         When considering the modern AIS under future warming scenarios, it has been shown
         that the implementation of subgrid interpolation of basal melting at grounding lines
         within SIA-SSA ISMs may accelerate grounding line retreat
         <span><a>50</a></span> and impacts upon the final ice volume predicted in long palaeo-integrations increasing
         the range in volume predictions
         <span><a>16</a></span>. None of the ISMs considered here include fine scale representations of the grounding
         line, for example, subgrid friction schemes
         <span><a>51</a></span> or adaptive mesh refinement
         <span><a>52</a></span> that has been shown to improve accuracy in a modern setting at very high (&lt;1 km)
         resolution. DeConto and Pollard also employ a parameterisation of ice-shelf hydrofracturing
         and ice-cliff collapse of marine-terminating ice margins, which is not included in
         any of the ISMs here and this could potentially have a large impact on predictions
         of sea level change for the Pliocene
         <span><a>21</a>,
            <a>22</a></span> (Table 
         <a>1</a>). As ISMs that are applicable to palaeo problems evolve (e.g. can be run on a continental
         scale for long time integrations), it is likely that such fine scale and novel grounding
         line parameterisations will continue to alter our understanding of potential ice-sheet
         collapse in the EAIS SGBs and this will be an interesting avenue for future research.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PLISMIP was the first ISM intercomparison project set up to shed light of palaeo ice-sheet
         variability, with the ambition of helping to understand the sensitivity of the ice-sheets
         in a warmer-than-modern world
         <span><a>27</a></span>. To realise this, one of the key aims of the PLISMIP project was to reconstruct the
         most likely geometry and volume of ice masses on Greenland and Antarctica. The results
         over Greenland allowed for an improvement to be made in the understanding of the potential
         extent and configuration of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Pliocene
         <span><a>40</a>,
            <a>41</a></span> and a new reconstruction has now been incorporated into the PRISM4 Pliocene reconstruction
         <span><a>53</a></span> and the experimental design for PlioMIP2
         <span><a>54</a></span>. However, results presented here and in other ice-sheet modelling studies for the
         Pliocene AIS
         <span><a>28</a></span> show that the level of uncertainty associated with simulating a marine-based WAIS
         and also the potential dynamic nature of the grounding line over the EAIS mean that
         we cannot be confident in using the results from this study to infer a most likely
         AIS configuration for the mPWP.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, our results unequivocally demonstrate that the climate forcing fields
         used (and in effect the climate model chosen) can have a significant impact on the
         predicted equilibrium state ice-sheet for the mPWP. When compared against other sources
         of uncertainty (e.g. ISM parameterisations and the choice of ISM), the atmospheric
         forcing field used brings in the largest source of uncertainty in terms of the global
         mean sea level change associated with volumetric changes in the ice-sheet (Table 
         <a>1</a>). We also show, however, that the details of the predicted ice-sheet configuration
         are generally more affected by which ISM is used, rather than the particular climate
         forcing, with a caveat that this may be affected by some of the ice boundary condition
         choices used within the PlioMIP models. Therefore it is important that as a community
         we do not place undue confidence on the ice-sheet reconstructions of one ISM or one
         climate model, when additional sources of structural uncertainty have not been considered.
