      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To compare our results with regional palaeoclimate datasets and climate forcing time
         series (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>), we assign an absolute time scale to the Sokli sequence. The age model is constrained
         by an event-stratigraphic correlation to U/Th-dated speleothem records from Sweden,
         Belgium and the Northern Alps
         <span><a>28</a>–
            <a>30</a></span>, and further supported by Greenland ice cores
         <span><a>31</a>,
            <a>32</a></span> and Norwegian Sea marine data
         <span><a>33</a></span> (see Methods for further details). Our age model suggests start of interglacial warm
         conditions at ca. 130 ka and end of the interglacial at ca. 117.5 ka.

               <p>Sokli data compared against other proxy and forcing time series. The coloured bars
                  indicate intervals of cool climate at Sokli (solid bars) and their suggested counterparts
                  in other datasets (hatched bars).
