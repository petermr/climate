      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outstanding features of our climate reconstructions are the distinct decoupled
         trends in summer (falling) and winter (rising) temperature across the Eemian, and
         the two abrupt events in the summer temperature reconstruction. Major features of
         these pollen-based reconstructions are supported by the aquatic proxy record from
         this sequence, including green microalgae (this study) and diatoms (ref.
         <span><a>24</a></span>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The diatom data corroborate the trend of increasing 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> reconstructed from pollen. Changes in the diatom composition reflect a prolongation
         of the open-water period in early Zone V, mainly as an effect of milder winters and
         an earlier ice-out. Following this, decreasing continentality is further indicated
         by decreasing stability of summer stratification; this interpretation is however complicated
         by decreasing water depths (due to lake infilling) which has a similar effect on the
         stability of stratification
         <span><a>24</a></span>. The Late-Eemian rise in reconstructed 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> also coincides with occurrences of spores of 
         <span>Osmunda regalis</span> (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). In modern northern Europe, 
         <span>O. regalis</span> has a distinctly oceanic distribution, with the most continental occurrences found
         in southern Sweden. Thus the Late-Eemian fossil occurrences at Sokli support the reconstructed,
         significantly warmer winters during this time. The heavy spores of 
         <span>O. regalis</span> are less likely to be transported by wind compared to pollen, however long-distance
         transport cannot be ruled out
         <span><a>34</a></span>. Although the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> reconstruction should be interpreted with caution, due to the comparatively weak
         signal of winter temperature in northern European pollen data (see Methods), here
         we regard the first-order trend towards warmer winters, validated by independent data,
         as the salient feature.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two cooling events in the pollen-based reconstructions are also seen in the aquatic
         record, which also provides indications of dry climate during these intervals. The
         occurrences of the green algae 
         <span>Pediastrum integrum</span> and 
         <span>Tetraëdron minimum</span>, and algal-type T.225
         <span><a>35</a></span>, at the end of Zone III (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) suggest that cooling of the Tunturi event may have started before the strong response
         in the terrestrial record (from ca. 23.8 m)
         <span><a>24</a></span>. Based on the combined multiproxy data, the Tunturi event appears to have two separate
         cold peaks, with sharp 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> minima at the onset and about two thirds into the event (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>). The terrestrial fossil sequence (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) shows a sharp recovery phase halfway through the event, with the pollen of 
         <span>Pinus</span> increasing at the expense of 
         <span>B. pubsescens/pendula</span>, and with a 
         <span>Pinus</span> stoma indicating local presence. The diatom data also suggest a mid-event recovery
         including warming and a rise in lake level
         <span><a>24</a></span>. Juniper is known to be frost-susceptible and prefers a winter snow-cover
         <span><a>36</a></span>, and its decreased values during the cooling peaks thus suggest relatively dry climate.
         This is further suggested by reduced values of 
         <span>Alnus</span> pollen, expansion of the wetland zone (peak in 
         <span>Salix</span>) and appearances of the shallow freshwater algae 
         <span>Spirogyra</span> (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>) and of aerophilic and halophilic diatoms
         <span><a>24</a></span>. While the Värriö event is seen as a sharp initial peak in the pollen-based reconstructions
         (Fig. 
         <a>3a</a>), in the aquatic proxies the Värriö event has a longer signature, and is even more
         distinct than the Tunturi event. Most importantly, peak values of 
         <span>Spirogyra</span> green algae and littoral diatom taxa indicate sudden drops in lake level during peak
         cooling
         <span><a>24</a></span>, while the cold-oligotrophic green algae 
         <span>P. integrum</span> has a strong maximum (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>), paralleling the response during the Tunturi event.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increasing body of data from the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas shows prominent
         and widespread cold and freshwater events intersecting interglacial conditions during
         the Eemian
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>15</a>,
            <a>17</a>–
            <a>20</a></span>. Sea-surface temperature (SST) proxies from the Nordic Seas show a prominent cooling
         at ca. 125–126 ka (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>). Records from the Eirik Drift, south of Greenland, show a concurrent cooling
         <span><a>17</a></span>, together with reductions in North Atlantic Deep Water formation, inferred from low
         benthic δ
         <span>13</span>C excursions, suggesting a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
         (AMOC; Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>)
         <span><a>15</a></span>. When comparing against the SST (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>) and AMOC (Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>) proxies, the Tunturi event at Sokli (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>) shows a similar duration and positioning between two warm periods with interglacial
         conditions, as well as a possible two-pronged structure of the cooling phase. At the
         East Greenland margin, two major glacial meltwater events have been identified at
         128.5 and 126.5 ka, based on negative anomalies in planktic foraminifera δ
         <span>18</span>O (Fig. 
         <a>4e</a>), with Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) melting implicated as the cause
         <span><a>19</a></span>. The early warm period seen at Sokli (pollen zone III) would thus coincide with the
         period of high SST’s (Fig. 
         <a>4c</a>) and relatively strong AMOC (Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>) between the successive meltwater outbursts. Based on alignment of the East Greenland
         margin and Eirik Drift records, it has been speculated
         <span><a>19</a></span> that a further meltwater outburst from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS)
         <span><a>37</a></span> may have prolonged the event initiated by the 126.5 ka meltwater input from the GIS.
         At the East Greenland Margin, a further meltwater spike has been documented in the
         Late Eemian (ca. 118 ka; Fig. 
         <a>4e</a>)
         <span><a>19</a></span>, while events of increasingly strong southward incursion of Arctic waters are seen
         in the subpolar North Atlantic over the Mid-to-Late Eemian
         <span><a>38</a></span>. Continued Late-Eemian events are also seen in the Eirik Drift proxy data (e.g.,
         117 and 120 ka; Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>)
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>, possibly due to the effects of warm temperatures and the hydrological cycle on surface
         ocean buoyancy
         <span><a>15</a></span>. However due to lack of absolute dating and the general ambiguity of chronological
         tie points within the Eemian
         <span><a>10</a></span>, we cannot confidently correlate the Late-Eemian Värriö event with a specific marine
         event.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The numerous continental Eemian sequences from the mid-latitudes of Europe do not
         reveal a comparable sequence of abrupt climate events, although increasing instabilities
         are seen in some records towards the Late Eemian
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>, but with no distinct, consistently recorded events
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>41</a>–
            <a>43</a></span>. Isolated pollen and speleothem sequences from mid-latitude Europe
         <span><a>30</a>,
            <a>44</a>–
            <a>46</a></span> have however suggested abrupt events within the Eemian. Transient ocean–atmosphere
         models of the Eemian do not reproduce comparable short-term climatic shifts, however
         these modelling efforts have focused on long-term trends and have not included possible
         forcings of abrupt climate events seen in the proxy data, such as meltwater pulses
         occurring after the major Early-Eemian deglaciation
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>47</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast with the mid-latitude data, the Eemian abrupt events have a strong and
         repeated expression in the emerging data from the high latitudes, including Sokli
         and the North Atlantic marine data, suggesting a northern distribution of the events.
         However, it is uncertain to what extent this distribution is affected by, e.g., resolution
         of datasets or differences in the seasonality of the events and the seasonal sensitivities
         of proxies in individual regions. We note that while the Eemian cooling events have
         proxy expressions lasting up to 2 ka (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>), they are both in our data and in the marine data
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>15</a></span> characterised by sharp and strong maxima against a longer event complex. Given the
         variable resilience and possible threshold responses in individual climate proxies,
         it might thus require a high-resolution multi-proxy dataset to resolve the events.
         An illustration of these challenges is provided by the Värriö event in the Sokli data.
         Here, only the initial sharp maximum is resolved in the pollen record, possibly because
         the site was located further from the forest–tundra ecotone than during the well-resolved
         Tunturi event. Meanwhile the Värriö event has a longer and stronger expression in
         the aquatic proxies
         <span><a>24</a></span>, likely due to already shallow conditions making the proxies sensitive to further
         shallowing. While the geographic and seasonal expression and the involved forcings
         and feedbacks remain to be fully resolved, in the context where the future evolution
         of the AMOC is poorly constrained (~0 to ~50% reduction by 2100 CE
         <span><a>48</a></span>), but with indications of a recent slowdown
         <span><a>49</a></span>, the Eemian abrupt events provide compelling evidence of repeated, realised instabilities
         against warmer than preindustrial background conditions
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>19</a></span>. Importantly, while the Early-Eemian freshwater and cold events (up to ca. 125 ka)
         may be tied to the main Saalian deglaciation and thus may not represent purely interglacial
         boundary conditions
         <span><a>19</a></span>, the Värriö event and the Mid/Late-Eemian abrupt events identified in the Labrador
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>17</a></span> and Nordic Seas
         <span><a>19</a></span> show that the instabilities persisted under warm interglacial conditions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In long-term Eemian climate trends, summer temperature reconstructions from central
         and western Europe consistently show an Early-Eemian maximum and a following cooling
         <span><a>40</a>,
            <a>42</a>,
            <a>43</a>,
            <a>50</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>4h</a>). With the exception of the abrupt events, the first-order trend in our 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> reconstruction (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>) agrees with these findings. For winter temperature (Fig. 
         <a>4g</a>), the mid-latitude European reconstructions also generally show a falling trend
         <span><a>39</a>–
            <a>43</a></span>. Some disagreement concerns whether the distinct shift towards colder winters happens
         already at the start of the Mid Eemian
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>40</a>,
            <a>42</a></span> or later, over the Late Eemian
         <span><a>41</a>,
            <a>43</a>,
            <a>50</a></span>. These discrepancies have been attributed to the abundant 
         <span>Carpinus</span> pollen in Mid-Eemian deposits (pollen Zone V in Fig. 
         <a>4g, h</a>) and human impact or competition affecting the modern distribution of this taxon,
         possibly biasing the pollen–climate modelling underpinning palaeo-reconstructions
         <span><a>39</a>,
            <a>41</a></span>. In contrast with these data from the mid-latitudes, our data show a long rise of
         
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> persisting through the Mid and Late Eemian, and generally running opposite to the
         falling 
         <span>T</span><sub>jul</sub> trend. This follows the secular insolation forcing in the northern high latitudes
         (Fig. 
         <a>4a, b</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an ensemble of transient climate models of the Eemian
         <span><a>4</a></span>, winter temperatures at 60–90 °N tend to fall in sync with summer insolation, due
         to the effect of summer temperature on sea ice formation during the following winter,
         thus locking winter temperature evolution with the summer forcing. By contrast, in
         northern mid-latitudes (30–60 °N) the modelled 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> robustly follows the rising trend in winter insolation. Our study area is located
         roughly where the transition in the winter trend occurs
         <span><a>51</a></span>, suggesting that cryosphere feedbacks should be pivotal in shaping winter climate
         in the region. However, current climate models have a generally poor robustness in
         regions affected by Arctic cryosphere feedbacks
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>8</a>,
            <a>51</a></span>, underlining the need for high-latitude proxy data with distinct winter climate signals
         to constrain the modelling.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our data, showing a persistent 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> rise, suggest a limited effect of summer insolation and sea-ice feedbacks in driving
         Eemian winter temperature evolution in the European Arctic. While the 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> rise parallels the trend in winter insolation forcing, the magnitude of winter warming
         is surprising considering the small absolute variation of winter insolation at high
         latitudes
         <span><a>4</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>4a</a>). This discrepancy may be explained by the suggested increasingly vigorous AMOC
         <span><a>15</a>,
            <a>52</a></span> (Fig. 
         <a>4d</a>), and proximally by the warm Nordic Seas
         <span><a>7</a>,
            <a>19</a>,
            <a>20</a>,
            <a>52</a></span> in the Late Eemian. Late-Eemian maxima in AMOC strength
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>47</a></span> and Nordic Seas surface temperature
         <span><a>52</a>,
            <a>53</a></span> are also predicted by transient modelling when including prescribed Northern Hemisphere
         ice-sheet dynamics, due to an uptake of freshwater by the expanding ice sheets, with
         the first-order changes in modelled AMOC matching the proxy data
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>15</a></span>. A strong AMOC and oceanic heat transport would also help explain the apparent contradiction
         of warmer-than-present summers persisting into the Late Eemian, despite the low insolation
         (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>). The winter warmth could be further induced by the strong westerlies suggested to
         have prevailed in the Late-Eemian northern Europe
         <span><a>52</a></span>. In climate modelling, strong westerlies and localised sea-ice feedbacks in the Barents
         Sea have been found to produce a strong 
         <span>T</span><sub>jan</sub> anomaly (+4–6 °C) centred over northeast Europe while only a minor anomaly (+0–2 °C)
         reaches the central and western European Eemian data sites
         <span><a>12</a></span>, a pattern consistent with the deviating Late-Eemian winter climate evolution seen
         at Sokli. The Late-Eemian climate at Sokli lends support to the hypothesis
         <span><a>38</a>,
            <a>52</a></span> of last glacial inception and nucleation of the Scandinavian ice sheet starting due
         to enhanced AMOC combined with low summer insolation and related feedbacks, resulting
         in increased winter precipitation and reduced summer snow melt. The cool summers but
         warm winters reconstructed at Sokli, suggesting a strong oceanic influence and increased
         precipitation, show climate conditions consistent with this hypothesis on the northern
         Fennoscandian continent, proximal to the site of glacial inception.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Eemian climate evolution in northernmost continental Europe reveals a distinct
         mixed influence of oceanic and insolation forcings, producing a decoupled evolution
         of winter and summer climate which in Europe appears to be unique to the high latitudes.
         These long-term climate trends are further modified by repeated abrupt cooling events
         persisting through the Eemian, linked to disturbances in the North Atlantic circulation
         regime.
