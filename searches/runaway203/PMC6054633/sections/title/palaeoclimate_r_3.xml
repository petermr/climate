  <span class="italic">T</span>

  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jul</sub>. This temperature decline is further interrupted by the Värriö event, where the abrupt onset represents a distinct fall in the median 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>jul</sub> reconstruction during the otherwise stable warm interval following the Tunturi event. During the initial sharp cooling peak (17.37–17.39 m) the individual reconstructions show a temperature fall of 0.7–2.7 °C compared to the preceding half-metre interval, with a mean magnitude of 1.8 °C, followed by a recovery to near pre-event temperatures. Zone VII sees a return to pre-interglacial

  <span class="italic">T</span>

  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) shows a muted variability for Zones I–IV but generally parallels the major features of the

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The modern pollen analogue distances for fossil pollen samples are short for the warm stages of the Eemian, being similar or lower compared to the mean distance for Late Holocene samples (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>). This suggests a robust reconstruction with small errors due to non-analogue palaeoclimate or climate–vegetation disequilibrium. The lack of wetland elements in the microfossil record, and the general scarcity of macrofossils, suggest that the coring site was situated in the central part of a lake. This is likely to help the pollen-based reconstruction as there is little non-climatic noise caused by local azonal vegetation, and the sequence rather samples the atmospherically mixed pollen of regional vegetation. Thus strong pollen analogues are found in the lake-based modern calibration data. However, the pollen analogue distances increase during the Early-Eemian pioneer vegetation stage and during the abrupt events characterised by rapid species turnover. This is reflected as noise and poor between method robustness in reconstructed temperature within these depth intervals.

 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The geographic locations of the modern pollen analogues are plotted in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d</a>. For Zones I–II, characterised by semi-open pioneer 
  <span class="italic">Betula</span> vegetation (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) and generally large analogue distances (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c</a>), the best modern analogues are found from various sectors of the modern forest–tundra ecotone of NE Europe. During the first warm stage (Zone III), best analogues are located in north-central Finland, south of Sokli, while a distinct shift towards northwest occurs during the Tunturi event (zone IV). Zone V reveals a shift in the analogue locations from south-central Finland to the southwest, which continues during zone VI when the best analogues end up in central Sweden. This parallels the trend towards warmer winters reconstructed with most methods (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>).
