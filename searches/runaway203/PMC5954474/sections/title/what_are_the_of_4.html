      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Small icebergs can halve incremental growth of benthic communities and thus the potential
         for carbon storage, as happened between 2007 and 2009 in Ryder Bay near Rothera research
         station (WAP) due to ice scour [
         <a>9</a>]. The creation of giant icebergs has many other effects besides those which can be
         considered negative feedbacks on climate change, not least including threats to installations
         (
         <a>figure 3</a><span>b</span>). When ice shelves collapse to form giant icebergs, the buttressing of land-based
         ice sheets is reduced [
         <a>28</a>,
         <a>29</a>]. Thus calving typically results in acceleration of land-based ice towards the sea,
         driving sea-level increases from any newly marine-based ice. This does not have an
         obvious direct positive or negative consequence on blue carbon storage but can accelerate
         deglaciation. New open water areas result in a strong albedo (reflectivity) change—from
         white to blue. This is a positive feedback on climate change because of the resulting
         extra heat absorbed. Depending on the extent of warming, this could have minor effects
         on benthos blue carbon capture: an increase in growth due to increasing meal processing
         rate [
         <a>6</a>,
         <a>9</a>] or a reduction of growth when temperatures proceed beyond organisms’ thermal tolerance
         envelopes [
         <a>30</a>]. More open water also has increased potential for gas exchange and thus CO
         <sub>2</sub> absorption, which could reduce benthic carbon immobilization and sequestration through
         ocean acidification [
         <a>31</a>]. This occurs not only because of increases in the physiological ‘cost’ of synthesizing
         and maintaining carbonate skeletal material but also because of the greater chance
         of it dissolving (after death) before burial.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major negative impact of giant icebergs on benthic blue carbon is if they collide
         with the seabed and scour. Giant icebergs would only ground and scour in deeper water,
         which may on average only occur once every few hundred years at any one location [
         <a>7</a>]. However, the residence time of some, e.g. A23 and B12, can be years to decades,
         which makes scour highly probable for the largest icebergs. For example, two of the
         largest three icebergs currently around Antarctica (A23A (1760 km
         <span>2</span>) and B22A (1056 km
         <span>2</span>)) were grounded in 2016/2017 in the shelf seabed. Such grounding can be a prolonged
         occurrence; for example, A23A has been grounded for more than three decades, since
         1986. The chances and location of any particular iceberg scouring depend not only
         on size (most 2016/2017 giants were 100–500 km
         <span>2</span> in area) but also on shape, calving location and current and wind direction and strength,
         as well as stochastic factors such as which eddies entrain it. Larger icebergs can
         be tracked such that their motion and fate can be followed; for example, in early
         2017 there were four icebergs (8.5%) larger than 30 km
         <span>2</span> in area grounded, and thus scouring blue carbon. The extent of this could be ground-truthed
         using ship-based multibeam, swath bathymetry data collection. Benthic imaging and
         sampling could then quantify blue carbon losses and, as such scours can be many kilometres
         long, they are likely to crush and recycle hundreds–thousands of tonnes of blue carbon
         standing stock. For example, benthos in the vicinity of the grounded scouring giant
         icebergs A23A and B22A hold 8–16 tonnes of standing stock of carbon per square kilometre
         [
         <a>5</a>,
         <a>32</a>]. Imagery and sampling in new deep water scours show near-complete destruction of
         fauna [
         <a>7</a>,
         <a>10</a>]. Many such scours occur in iceberg hotspots, which reduces blue carbon losses (repeat
         scouring by an iceberg of a site in an early recovery stage recycles less carbon than
         scouring of a rarely hit area of climax benthic fauna). Scouring climax benthic communities
         might recycle 16 tonnes of carbon per square kilometre (the maximum standing stocks
         of benthos from [
         <a>5</a>,
         <a>32</a>]). We found that there were clear hot- and coldspots of iceberg scouring in deep
         waters around Antarctica (
         <a>figure 4</a><span>a</span>). The Lazarev, Cosmonauts, Davis and East Amundsen Seas were hotspots of deep shelf
         grounding, whereas there was little deep-water scouring in the Bellingshausen and
         Ross Seas. The paths of giant icebergs (from US National Ice Center satellite data)
         also showed distinct patterns, firstly following the anticlockwise coastal current,
         then leaving the shelf from the Eastern Weddell and Ross Seas and being dispersed
         by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (
         <a>figure 4</a><span>b</span>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even if only one-fifth of giant icebergs of the size of A23A/B22A were grounded, more
         than 5 × 10
         <span>3</span> tonnes of benthic carbon per year could be recycled rather than stored and buried.
         To date, such losses have not been quantified in absolute frequencies at depths relevant
         to giant icebergs. Even scouring has some positive blue carbon aspects in terms of
         potential to bury benthos in sediment berms, resuspend food material (enhancing growth
         in nearby benthos) and open up space for faster-growing benthic pioneer species [
         <a>33</a>].
