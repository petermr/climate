 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zoobenthic production around Antarctic continental shelves varies considerably with geography and depth, but can be approximately 13 g C m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in the shallows [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>], through to approximately 5 g C m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> at 100–300 m and approximately 1.5 g C m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> below 300 m depth [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C35">35</a>]. Production in the upper 100 m is little studied and complicated by ice scour, but at least along the WAP has been estimated as equalling the total (continental shelf) below it [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C9" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C9">9</a>]. Most data occur for 100 m and below, so an estimate of Antarctic zoobenthic production was made from this [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C35">35</a>]. If an approximate mean of organic carbon of 3 g C m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> is used, scaled up to 3 t C km
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and the same amount of carbonate (which varies enormously and of which only 12% is carbon), this gives a total of approximately 3.4 t C km
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. If the shallows below 100 m are of similar value, then 3.4 × 2 = 6.8 t C km
  <span class="sup">−2</span> yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Multiplied by the area of Antarctica's continental shelf (4.4 × 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), it is approximately 30 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. This figure is considerably less than 1% of annual anthropogenic emission; however, production has doubled (at least in some biota) since the 1990s around many Antarctic shelves due to sea-ice changes [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>], so this estimate may now be closer to 60 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. This has to be further increased to account for ice shelf losses opening up large new areas of benthic production, estimated to generate as much as 10 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>]. Yet such newly ice shelf-free areas have been found to be two to three times more productive [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>] than originally thought [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>]. The current work estimates that we need to add a million tonnes for each 5000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> iceberg calved. Each of these increases to the initial estimate adds considerable uncertainty, but may be approximately 80 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (initial estimate at 30 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1 </span>× 2 for increases due to sea-ice losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>,
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C6">6</a>] (+10 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for new production with ice shelf losses [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C18">18</a>] × 2 for new estimates of growth rates in new ice shelf loss areas [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C19">19</a>])). This approximate 80 Mt C does not take into account that there is as much continental shelf at sub-Antarctic latitudes and that many of Antarctica's outlying islands [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C5" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C5">5</a>] and sub-Antarctic islands can be much more productive [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C36">36</a>] than those further south (with exceptions [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C26">26</a>]). Doubling our estimate to approximately 160 Mt C yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to account for sub-Antarctic continental shelf areas, while appearing large, is only marginally more than 1% of global anthropogenic carbon output. We would argue that it is more important than its empiric value suggests because benthos is at the principal sites of burial, with genuine sequestration potential. This is unlike more considerable but more uncertain values dissolved in the ocean (due to temporal or spatial outgassing) or held in pelagic or forest biomass, which has much more time and space to be broken down on death and recycled in the microbial loop. Increases in sea temperature could yet increase zoobenthic carbon storage further [
  <a rid="RSTA20170176C37" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTA20170176C37">37</a>], but this may be more than counteracted by ocean acidification, adding yet more uncertainty to estimated totals. The current work aimed to estimate the iceberg component of biological carbon sequestration in the southern polar region. Thus, our contextual calculations of total southern polar region zoobenthic carbon storage is only approximate, with considerable error, but it does suggest that icebergs have an important role (10–20%) within this biological component, as recently suggested [
