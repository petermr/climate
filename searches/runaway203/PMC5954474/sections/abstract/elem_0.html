      <p>Sea ice, including icebergs, has a complex relationship with the carbon held within
         animals (blue carbon) in the polar regions. Sea-ice losses around West Antarctica's
         continental shelf generate longer phytoplankton blooms but also make it a hotspot
         for coastal iceberg disturbance. This matters because in polar regions ice scour limits
         blue carbon storage ecosystem services, which work as a powerful negative feedback
         on climate change (less sea ice increases phytoplankton blooms, benthic growth, seabed
         carbon and sequestration). This resets benthic biota succession (maintaining regional
         biodiversity) and also fertilizes the ocean with nutrients, generating phytoplankton
         blooms, which cascade carbon capture into seabed storage and burial by benthos. Small
         icebergs scour coastal shallows, whereas giant icebergs ground deeper, offshore. Significant
         benthic communities establish where ice shelves have disintegrated (giant icebergs
         calving), and rapidly grow to accumulate blue carbon storage. When 5000 km
         <span>2</span> giant icebergs calve, we estimate that they generate approximately 10
         <span>6</span> tonnes of immobilized zoobenthic carbon per year (t C yr
         <span>−1</span>). However, their collisions with the seabed crush and recycle vast benthic communities,
         costing an estimated 4 × 10
         <span>4</span> t C yr
         <span>−1</span>. We calculate that giant iceberg formation (ice shelf disintegration) has a net potential
         of approximately 10
         <span>6</span> t C yr
         <span>−1</span> sequestration benefits as well as more widely known negative impacts.
