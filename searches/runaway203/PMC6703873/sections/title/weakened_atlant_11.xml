 <p>Histograms of 10,000 realizations of the bootstrap method for the Pacific SST response (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) and vertical velocity anomalies at 600 hPa (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) in the initial experiments under control (blue) and 4× CO
  <sub>2</sub> (red) (see “Model experiments” section in Materials and Methods). The Pacific SST response is measured by the area-averaged D0JF1 equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) SST anomalies, and the vertical velocity anomalies at 600 hPa are averaged over the equatorial Atlantic (5°S to 5°N and 45°W to 20°E) during boreal summer (pascals per second; JJA0). The blue and red vertical lines indicate the mean values of 10,000 inter-realizations for the present-day and future periods, respectively. The gray shaded regions indicate the respective doubled SDs (the 95% confidence interval based on normal distribution) of the 10,000 inter-realization (see “Bootstrap test” section in Materials and Methods).
