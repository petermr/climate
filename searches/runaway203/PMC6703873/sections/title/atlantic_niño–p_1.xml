 <div class="title">Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection in observation and CMIP5 models.</div>
 <p>Correlation coefficients of the Atl-EOF index (JJA0) and the grid-point D0JF1 equatorial Pacific (5°S to 5°N and 160°E to 90°W) SST anomalies over a 20-year running window from 1900 to 2017 (recorded at end year of the window) in Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) and over the 1900–1999 period in HadISST (black bar) and 33 CMIP5 models (
  <span class="bold">B</span>). Black solid line in (A) indicates area-averaged values of all the correlation coefficients in the equatorial Pacific. Red dots in (A) and bars in (B) indicate the average of only significant (more than 95% confidence level) correlation coefficients in the respective period (see “Sign-dependent average” section in Materials and Methods). Values of models that fail to produce any significant impact of Atlantic Niño on the equatorial Pacific are set to be zero in (B). Black dashed lines in (A) denote the value (±0.466) of the 95% confidence level based on Student’s 
  <span class="italic">t</span> test. (
  <span class="bold">C</span> to 
  <span class="bold">E</span>) Spatial pattern of the correlation between the Atl-EOF index (JJA0) and the grid-point D0JF1 tropical Pacific SST anomalies over the 1900–1999 period based on HadISST (C), multimodel average of the 17 selected models (D), and multimodel average of the six models [orange bars in (B)] with opposite Atlantic Niño–Pacific connection (E). The values more than the 95% confidence level in (C) and the most robust features of ensemble where the mean exceeds 1 SD in (D) and (E) are hatched.
