      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Delineating a managed land base is the only universally accepted approach for estimating
         anthropogenic emissions and removals associated with land use [
         <a>14</a>]. The managed land proxy has weaknesses because it is not feasible to fully discriminate
         between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic emissions and removals. Non-anthropogenic
         emissions and removals from processes such as natural disturbances, nitrogen deposition,
         and CO
         <sub>2</sub> fertilization do occur on managed land, and are difficult, if not impossible, to
         separate from anthropogenic sources. Regardless, there is flexibility in the application
         of the proxy to meet national circumstances as illustrated in the examples from Brazil,
         Canada and the United States, by incorporating additional criteria to better delineate
         the managed land base, such as functional criteria, vegetation structure, and accessibility.
         In turn, this will focus attention on the regions that are influenced directly by
         management activity with the goal of developing effective GHG mitigation policies
         enhancing land-based sinks and/or reducing sources of emissions by improving land
         management.
