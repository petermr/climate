      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil applies IPCC approach 3 methods for land representation, meaning that classification
         is spatially explicit (i.e., all land area is explicitly classified). The Brazilian
         government utilizes several criteria (i.e., information plans/layers) and datasets
         to determine the managed land base, including biome maps, municipal boundaries, native
         vegetation maps (phytophysiognomy), soil types and land use/cover maps from visual
         interpretation of Landsat-type satellite imagery. The integration of all these georeferenced
         layers generates uniquely defined polygons in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
         that cover the entire national territory. Specifically, each polygon belongs to a
         single biome, municipality, vegetation type, soil type, and land use/cover. The native
         forest land and native grassland that fall over legally created Conservation Units
         and/or demarcated Indigenous Land are included as part of the managed land database.
         From one inventory year to another, changes in land use/cover are identified, and
         a polygon in one inventory year may be split into several sub-polygons in the next
         inventory year, if the entire polygon does not remain in the same land use/cover category.
         All the native forest land and grassland that is part of the managed land base and
         is subject to land clearing during the period of inventory is re-classified as another
         land use category in the same period, even in the case that the land could be temporarily
         unstocked with trees in the case of forest land.
