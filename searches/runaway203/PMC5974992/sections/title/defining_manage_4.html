      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Defining managed land</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the governments providing information about application of the managed land
         proxy to subdivide forest land, grassland and wetlands into managed and unmanaged
         land, several have classified managed land simply by considering some land uses as
         managed and others as unmanaged. For example, Australia and Belarus consider all forest
         land, grasslands and wetlands as managed, while land in the ‘other land’ category
         (e.g., rock outcrops, glaciers, barren areas) is considered unmanaged. New Zealand
         considers all grassland and forest land as managed, while wetlands are considered
         unmanaged. The Russian Federation, Ukraine and Peru use the same criteria as New Zealand,
         except that they have designated some forest land in reserves or natural forests as
         unmanaged.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some governments apply the managed land proxy with additional criteria, such as Canada,
         Brazil and the United States. Canada has subdivided grassland, forest land and wetlands
         into managed and unmanaged areas. Grassland is considered managed if used for grazing
         domestic livestock, designated as a national park or is used for an expressed purpose,
         such as a military base [
         <a>19</a>]. Canada considers wetlands in which human intervention has directly altered the
         water table level as managed, and there are two types: peatlands drained for peat
         extraction and flooded land associated with the creation of reservoirs. For reporting
         GHG emissions and removals, managed forests include all forest land that is subject
         to management for timber and non-timber resources as well as other ecological services.
         Therefore, managed land includes the timber harvest land base and other areas, including
         parks and reserved areas. Moreover, because fire suppression efforts in Canada also
         affect GHG emissions and removals, areas that are under intensive protection against
         natural disturbances, mostly fire, are considered managed forests even if there is
         no timber extraction or other non-timber forest use (Fig. 
         <a>3</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brazil defines all secondary forests and grasslands, planted forests, and forests
         subject to selective logging as managed land. Natural grasslands and natural forest
         land are considered unmanaged except in the following cases: [
         <a>1</a>] legally created Conservation Unit areas in Federal and State Conservation Units
         (Except the Private Reserves of National Preservation, due to the lack of consistent
         information regarding management interventions), in accordance with the Ministry of
         the Environment and the National System of Nature Conservation Units; and [
         <a>2</a>] legally demarcated Indigenous Lands, as per information from the National Indian
         Foundation (FUNAI). Managed wetlands include all reservoirs, which are created through
         human activity, while rivers and lakes are considered unmanaged. Other land is classified
         as unmanaged.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States has taken yet another approach by focusing on direct intervention
         [
         <a>20</a>]. The definition states “managed land occurs mostly in areas accessible to human
         activity and includes altering or maintaining the condition of the land to produce
         commercial or non-commercial products or services; to serve as transportation corridors
         or locations for buildings, landfills, or other developed areas for commercial or
         non-commercial purposes; to extract resources or facilitate acquisition of resources;
         or to provide social functions for personal, community or societal objectives where
         these areas are readily accessible to society” [
         <a>20</a>]. The United States government has incorporated accessibility of the land as a criterion,
         and included specific functions in the definition.
