 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Design storms were estimated for different return periods under past and future scenarios. IDF (Intensity Duration Frequency) curves were developed for observed (historical climate) and 4 GCMs of RCP 4.5 pathway (projected climate scenarios) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). IDF curves were developed for 5 different durations (1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h) with 5 return periods of 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 years for observed and projceted climate scenario. Therefore, 25 annual maximum time series were used for the frequency analysis to develop the IDF curves. The result shows that the intensity of rainfall for 2 year return period is 33.57 mm/hr under observed climate. Similarly, for 10 year return period, the intensity is 57.89 mm/hr and 88.22 mm/hr intensity is estimated for 100 year return period rainfall. Intensities for 2 year return period for models cesm1_cam5, mpi_esm_mr, ncar_ccsm4, bnu_esm are 37.61 mm/hr, 33.32 mm/hr, 36.50 mm/hr and 36.03 mm/hr respectively. Intensities for 100 year return periods are 165.67 mm/hr, 126.6 mm/hr, 117.75 mm/hr and 130.79 mm/hr. These estimated time series were used in the model for the simulation process.
