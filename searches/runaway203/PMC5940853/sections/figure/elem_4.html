         <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage
            increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment)
            forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes
            increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained
            deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry.
            The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals,
            hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent
            growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions
            &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
            <span>−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight
            levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained
            depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends
            on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling
            of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases
            the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore
            coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence
            dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.
