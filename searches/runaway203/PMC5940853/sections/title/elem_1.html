      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural cirrus, persistent contrails and contrail cirrus are high level clouds composed
         of ice crystals that form and evolve in ice supersaturated regions
         <span><a>15</a></span>. Ice supersaturation denotes sufficiently cold and moist atmospheric conditions—relative
         to saturation with respect to the ice phase—that influence radiative properties, extent
         and lifetimes of all cirrus cloud types and is required for contrails to be long-lived
         and evolve into contrail cirrus (Table 
         <a>1</a>). Duration and extent of ice supersaturated regions and the magnitude of ice supersaturation
         within them strongly depend on the synoptic (meteorological) situation and set upper
         limits for the lifetime and extent of AIC. Outside ice supersaturated areas in drier
         or warmer (ice subsaturated) air, contrails may still form, but are only short-lived
         and thus stay narrow with small areal coverage, leaving little to no impact on RF.
         Cirrus ice crystals form around microscopic aerosol particles. What sets AIC primarily
         apart from natural cirrus is the aircraft-dominated formation stage, wherein jet engine
         emissions, modified in aircraft wakes, result in a larger number of smaller ice crystals
         <span><a>5</a>,
            <a>16</a>,
            <a>17</a></span> and therefore different evolution pathways and radiative effects. Understanding the
         processes at work in the formation and subsequent atmospheric spreading stage is key
         in determining the relative importance of aircraft/fuel-related meteorological and
         microphysical controls on AIC RF.

               <p>AIC subsume persistent contrails and contrail cirrus and potentially clouds either
                  formed or modified by aircraft soot and sulphate particle emissions. In this review,
                  the latter are not included in AIC due to lack of observational evidence of their
                  existence. Contrails are line-shaped at formation and may attain irregular shapes
                  due to non-uniform winds, turbulent (random) motions and humidity fluctuations at
                  some point during their lifetime. Long-lived contrails spread out due to wind shear
                  that is common at cruise altitudes. Those maintaining a linear shape are referred
                  to as persistent contrails. Irregular-shaped contrail cirrus cannot be easily distinguished
                  from natural cirrus hampering their observation. Dimensions of contrail cirrus clouds
                  depend on poorly known morphologies and have not been studied systematically, but
                  are likely highly variable. At northern middle latitudes, individual ice supersaturated
                  regions may have lifetimes of several days
                  <span><a>143</a></span> and pathlengths exceeding 1000 km (ref. 
                  <span><a>144</a></span>), but such cases are rare and mean values are significantly lower. Ice supersaturated
                  layer depths ranging between 300 and 1300 m have been estimated from corrected radiosonde

            10 min (ref. 
            <span><a>18</a></span>). Through a combination of models, laboratory and in situ measurements, the last
            two decades have seen significant advances in identifying and understanding thermo-,
            fluid-dynamical and microphysical processes in the formation stage. Understanding
            these processes is essential to model and predict initial AIC properties.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrails begin to form when jet engine exhaust plumes expand and their constituents
            mix with surrounding ambient air (Fig. 
            <a>2</a>). In line with aircraft observations
            <span><a>4</a></span>, a thermodynamic mixing model
            <span><a>19</a></span> has shown that temperatures typically below 233 K (≈−40 °C) provide a threshold below
            which either short-lived or long-lived contrails appear behind jet aircraft cruising
            above ≈8 km (formation constraint). Contrail occurrence is predicted with confidence,
            if ambient pressure and relative humidity, water vapour and heat emissions, and propulsive
            characteristics of aircraft engines are known. The underlying definition of threshold
            temperatures rests on the assumption that exhaust plumes surpass water saturated conditions
            (water saturation constraint). The thermodynamic approach is not capable of predicting
            formation (nucleation) pathways and microphysical properties of ice crystals in contrails.
            
            <div><span>Fig. 2</span><div>
                  <p>Processes influencing the contrail formation stage. Exhaust plumes produced by combusting
                     fuel–air mixtures at high temperature and pressure within turbofan jet engines contain
                     gaseous and particulate matter. Particles types present in the freely expanding and
                     cooling plumes (jet regime) comprise emitted soot particles and aqueous aerosol particles
                     formed in the exhaust (Box 
                     <a>1</a>) along with entrained ambient aerosol particles. When turbulent mixing (arrows) and
                     the associated cooling produces plume supersaturation over liquid water (
                     <span>s</span><sub>w</sub> &gt; 0), copious plume particles turn into water droplets (grey) that freeze and grow
                     rapidly by uptake of water vapour forming a visible contrail. This happens when the
                     ambient temperature, 
                     <span>T</span>, falls below the formation threshold, 
                     <span>Θ</span>. In soot-rich exhaust, most droplets contain soot inclusions. Droxtals, frozen water
                     droplets with faceted surfaces, and hexagonal prisms and columns likely developing
                     from them may provide a realistic representation of small ice crystals in fresh contrails,
                     but no direct observational evidence for their shapes is available. Plumes from multiple
                     aircraft engines merge with two wing tip vortices, forming an inhomogeneous wake.
                     The further evolution of ice crystals depends largely on fluid-dynamical processes
                     (vortex regime). The downward motion of the vortex pair warms the air causing ice
                     crystal sublimation in the lower part of the wake. A small contrail fraction is released
                     from the jets remaining at flight level and enhanced by detrainment of air from the
                     lower wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake continue to grow by uptake of entrained
                     ice-supersaturated (

            nanometre-sized (ultrafine) aqueous aerosol particles formed within the plumes and
            particles mixed (entrained) into the plumes from the ambient air (Box 
            <a>1</a>). In the cooling plumes, these particles interact with condensable vapours—mainly
            emitted water vapour—and ionised gas molecules. The different particle types compete
            for supersaturated vapour in water droplet formation; for current emissions, soot
            particles figure most prominently in droplet formation. Although water droplets are
            initially present in contrails, they are unstable since the upper troposphere stays
            below liquid water saturation
            <span><a>20</a>,

            occur, with rates of homogeneous (pure liquid) droplet freezing increasing dramatically
            with decreasing temperature (phase constraint). The presence of ice crystals in contrails
            is supported by ample observational evidence
            <span><a>25</a></span>. An analysis of aircraft observations shows that many (&gt;10,000 cm
            <span>−3</span>) small (&lt;1 µm) ice crystals need to form within a wingspan behind cruising aircraft
            to make contrails visible already at formation
            <span><a>26</a></span> (visibility constraint). This is possible since plume cooling rates driven by turbulent
            mixing
            <span><a>27</a></span> are high and plume particles acting as water condensation nuclei are abundant

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
            <a>2</a> indicates that properties of persistent contrails are further developed through circulatory
            airflow patterns (vortices) appearing behind aircraft wings. Plumes from multiple
            aircraft engines merge with the vortex pair, forming an inhomogeneous wake. The further
            evolution of ice crystals depends on the interaction between jet plumes and wake vortices.
            The vortex pair, in which most of the contrail is captured, descends some 100 m below
            the flight level. This downward motion leads to a partial loss of ice crystals due
            to sublimation in the lower part of the wake. Ice crystals present in the upper wake
            continue to grow by uptake of entrained ice supersaturated water vapour. After few
            minutes of contrail age, the wake-averaged ice crystal size distribution contains
            signatures of nucleation, growth and sublimation. Eventually, flow instability triggered
            by turbulence causes the organised flow pattern to collapse and mix with ambient air,
            terminating the formation stage. Evolution of ice crystals in engine plumes and aircraft

            model predictions of UAP activation into nearly pure water droplets uncertain. Hygroscopic

            and particle scavenging processes in the jet exhaust plume producing thin aqueous
            coatings affecting their droplet formation (water activation) behaviour. In liquid
            water-supersaturated conditions, the largest and most soluble aerosol particles preferably

            This happens along with homogeneous water droplet freezing at plume temperatures 229–232 K

            on the ability to transfer the process understanding outlined above into models that

            and in which supersaturation is not resolved at scales (≈0.1–1 cm) below which molecular

            By invoking a heterogeneous (solid surface assisted) ice nucleation mode involving

            rapid formation of copious ice crystals preventing water supersaturation from occurring.

            Near the contrail threshold, only few ice crystals form, since low plume supersaturation
            diminishes water activation of soot particles. Ice crystal numbers decrease about
            100-fold from soot-rich to soot-poor conditions, approaching constant low values set
            by the number of particles in the contrail environment. Ice crystal numbers increase
            at low ambient temperatures in soot-poor exhaust due to water activation and subsequent
            freezing of abundant aqueous plume particles (Box

                     12 K below this value. At intermediate ambient temperatures, nucleated ice crystal
                     numbers increase due to enhanced water activation of either soot or ultrafine aqueous

                     and freeze increases with decreasing ambient temperature that in turn increases plume

                     activated owing to diminishing plume supersaturation; the number concentrations of
                     ambient particles are much lower in contrails than current soot emission levels. The
                     plume cooling rate determines the time of water activation of entrained ambient particles,
                     hence, the number of ice crystals derived from them. In soot-poor exhaust, ultrafine

                     contains sufficient amounts of condensable vapours besides water vapour. Those small

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microphysical and optical properties of ice crystals in contrails change as they spread
            or transition into contrail cirrus, depending on the meteorological situation and
            microphysical processes (Fig. 
            <a>5</a>). Over time, persistent contrails lose their initial linear shape and transition
            into contrail cirrus. They overlap and merge in traffic-congested areas, forming extended
            ice cloud layers that vary in shape, depth and lifetime and differ from natural cirrus
            in terms of microphysical, optical and geometrical properties. Ice supersaturated
            layers supporting them differ in vertical structure and horizontal area and the exchange
            of water molecules between vapour and ice phases within them. All these factors influence
            the RF potential of AIC (Box

            factors controlling them.

                  <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage
                     increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment)
                     forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes
                     increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained
                     deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry.
                     The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals,
                     hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent
                     growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions
                     &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
                     <span>−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight
                     levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained
                     depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends
                     on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling
                     of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases
                     the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore
                     coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence
                     dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space borne and aircraft measurements provide a fairly detailed picture of contrail
            properties, albeit with a considerable spread of observation results. While first
            steps resolving the transition of contrails into contrail cirrus have been taken,
            cloud system resolving models linking the regional scale evolution of AIC to specific
            meteorological situations and simulating their microphysical interactions with natural
            cirrus are lacking. To inform our incomplete understanding of the spreading stage,
            such models are needed along with collocated observations of mesoscale (1–100 km)
            vertical air motion and associated ice supersaturation variability as well as properties
            of ice nucleating ambient atmospheric particles

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the top of the atmosphere, annually and globally averaged, incoming shortwave (SW,
            solar) radiation and the outgoing longwave (LW, thermal) radiation cancel out unless
            a climate forcing, such as changes in properties of clouds, perturbs this balance
            <span><a>134</a>,
               <a>135</a></span>. An initial perturbation of the radiation balance defines RF, a first-order indicator
            of the importance of different climate change mechanisms. RF refers to initial imbalances
            over a specified region and period of time; those provided by the IPCC
            <span><a>7</a></span> are global averages taken relative to a pre-industrial time (1750). Global RF cannot
            be observed directly and is therefore obtained with the help of models or by extrapolation
            of regional values inferred from satellite observations.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OD—measuring the opacity of a medium when electromagnetic radiation of a given wavelength,
            
            <span>λ</span>, passes through it—is a crucial determinant of RF. OD and RF are determined by a
            number of radiative transfer processes. Ice in high level clouds, i.e., thin cirrus
            and long-lived contrails, acts similar to cloud-free air (
            <span>a</span>): it decreases the energy lost to outer space, enhancing the temperature in the atmosphere
            below the cloud and at the Earth’s surface (cloud greenhouse forcing). Cloud ice crystals
            affect RF by reducing thermal emission (radiant energy with 
            <span>λ</span> &gt; 4 µm) to space via absorption and re-emission of LW radiation at cold temperatures.
            Contrary to low clouds composed mainly of liquid water droplets (
            <span>b</span>), high ice clouds are often optically thin (
            <span>c</span>,
            <span> d</span>), i.e., partially transparent to solar radiation (
            <span>λ</span> ≈ 0.2–4 µm), meaning their ability to scatter SW radiation back to space (albedo
            forcing) is small. The greenhouse forcing is stronger for higher and colder clouds,
            in which ice crystals are increasingly abundant. The net average diurnal RF due to
            thin cirrus and contrails is a small positive residual from the wavelength-integrated
            SW and LW forcings. RF contributions due to thickening of natural cirrus by embedded
            contrails and new ice crystal formation in contrail areas with low ice crystal concentrations,
            blurring the distinction between natural cirrus and contrail cirrus, have not yet
            been determined.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beside the power received from the Sun (solar irradiance) and Earth’s atmosphere,
            Earth surface conditions and vertical distribution (overlap) of clouds, wavelength
            dependent scattering and absorption properties of single ice crystals are needed to
            estimate OD and RF. Those properties depend on shapes (habits), surface roughness
            and orientation against incident light of cloud ice crystals across their size distribution,
            all of which are difficult to quantify in airborne measurements. Emissivity (absorption
            and emission at near infrared wavelengths, LW forcing) and reflectance (scattering
            at visible wavelengths, SW forcing) of high ice clouds are determined by OD and physical
            properties of ice crystals. Reflectance is sensitive to the habits of small ice crystals.
            Optical contrail models assume mixtures of various habits with fixed fractional weights

            and ice crystal size is not well known.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive (negative) RF induces a warming (cooling) tendency that is subsequently communicated
            throughout the whole atmosphere. The strength of the resulting response in globally
            averaged, equilibrium near surface air temperature, Δ
            <span>T</span>, is estimated by the climate sensitivity parameter
