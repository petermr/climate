 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microphysical and optical properties of ice crystals in contrails change as they spread or transition into contrail cirrus, depending on the meteorological situation and microphysical processes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). Over time, persistent contrails lose their initial linear shape and transition into contrail cirrus. They overlap and merge in traffic-congested areas, forming extended ice cloud layers that vary in shape, depth and lifetime and differ from natural cirrus in terms of microphysical, optical and geometrical properties. Ice supersaturated layers supporting them differ in vertical structure and horizontal area and the exchange of water molecules between vapour and ice phases within them. All these factors influence the RF potential of AIC (Box 
  <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">2</a>). Much of the knowledge about spreading contrails summarised below stems from space-borne observations

    <p>Factors affecting the development of aircraft-induced clouds. Areal cloud coverage increases due to vertical shear of horizontal wind components. Turbulent mixing (entrainment) forces ice crystal concentrations to decrease (dilute) over time. Ice crystal sizes increase by uptake (deposition) of water vapour from ice-supersaturated layers. Sustained deposition growth causes ice crystal shapes (habits) to deviate from initial isometry. The shapes of ice crystals, which are only poorly known and illustrated as droxtals, hexagonal prisms and columns, bullet rosettes and aggregates, affect their size-dependent growth and fall rates and optical properties. Ice crystals with maximum dimensions &gt;30 µm settle (sediment) due to gravity with fall speeds &gt;100 m h
     <span class="sup">−1</span> and sublimate in warmer or drier air, while smaller crystals remain around the flight levels due to negligible fall speeds as long as some supersaturation can be maintained depending on the meteorological situation. The efficiency of sedimentation depends on the depositional growth rate, i.e., on ice supersaturation, the rate of cooling of air, and on ice crystal size, habit and number concentration. Sedimentation increases the vertical extent of AIC, which, in turn, enhances the rate of spreading and therefore coverage in a sheared flow. Sustained warming and drying due to large-scale subsidence dissolves AIC entirely. Ice crystal images adapted from ref.

 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Optical properties of ice crystals influence AIC RF. Cloud optical depth (OD) measures the attenuation of radiation passing through cloud (Box 
  <a rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec7">2</a>) and is often reported at a wavelength in the visible part of the radiation spectrum. AIC RF is roughly proportional to OD and areal cloud coverage. Estimates of spatial coverage and radiative properties of optically thin (transparent) ice clouds depend on thresholds for determining their boundaries. Those thresholds could be a lower OD limit in remote sensing observations or a lower limit of ice water content in in situ measurements.

Both studies reported persistent contrails embedded in cirrus or sharing an atmospheric column with extant cirrus and suggested enhancements in OD and effective ice crystal size over the values found for contrails alone. A study quantified over the eastern North Pacific statistically the effect of contrails on OD of already existing cirrus, resulting in enhanced cirrus OD inside selected flight tracks, mostly in vertically thinner ice clouds

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>, all types of observations remain inconclusive regarding the ability to separate contrail cirrus from natural cirrus due to the large variability in geometrical and microphysical properties of the latter. Moreover, it is difficult in dense traffic areas to determine whether natural cirrus have already been perturbed by aircraft emissions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Space borne and aircraft measurements provide a fairly detailed picture of contrail properties, albeit with a considerable spread of observation results. While first steps resolving the transition of contrails into contrail cirrus have been taken, cloud system resolving models linking the regional scale evolution of AIC to specific meteorological situations and simulating their microphysical interactions with natural cirrus are lacking. To inform our incomplete understanding of the spreading stage, such models are needed along with collocated observations of mesoscale (1–100 km) vertical air motion and associated ice supersaturation variability as well as properties of ice nucleating ambient atmospheric particles
