      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Methodologies combining estimates of contrail coverage from meteorological reanalysis
         data and mean contrail OD in off-line radiative transfer models and used to diagnose
         global contrail RF in climate models have been replaced by simulations of AIC within
         global models
         <span><a>62</a></span>. Adding or elaborating on processes may be required to improve on specific problems.
         However, this would expand the space of underlying model parameters, possibly compromising
         the robustness of the models’ predictive capability and the goal of reducing overall
         model uncertainty
         <span><a>124</a></span>. Parameterisation schemes used in such models should therefore be informed by theory,
         whereby it is important to capture the most influential processes governing a specific
         application, and document the physical soundness and plausibility of the scheme. Understanding
         how well global climate models work for a specific purpose (evaluation) is important,
         but in itself is not a straightforward task. At times the disagreement of a model
         with observations motivates model improvements.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important task in support of model improvement is ascertaining its “truth”
         (validation), e.g., by comparison with suitable measurements. In models with many
         compensating uncertainties, several pathways of process representation conforming
         to the same set of underlying physical laws may lead to similar plausible agreement
         with observations. Just because models agree with some measurements does not imply
         reduced uncertainty in their RF predictions. In view of the case study nature of many
         measurements, observationalists and modellers should aspire to clarify if and exactly
         how measurements can be used to validate models and constrain uncertainty. Introducing
         microphysical mechanisms in cloud parameterisations without critical analysis, theoretical
         underpinning or support by empirical evidence increases the likelihood of model fallacies.
         Unexamined process representation carries the danger of proliferating unsubstantiated
         conclusions. The resulting enhanced uncertainty levels are difficult to judge and
         may be irreducible.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of rigorous model evaluation and validation has serious repercussions for the
         interpretation of model results. A way out could be to devise models based on a minimal
         set of processes with only a few open physical parameters and expounding meaningful
         ways of how model behaviour could be confirmed or falsified. Complexity would be added
         only when needed, fulfilling a methodological principle known as ‘Ockham’s razor’.
         To minimise AIC model uncertainty, ice cloud parameterisations should conform to a
         number of tenets: full inclusion of AIC into the model’s hydrological cycle, as cloud-induced
         changes in the moisture and heat budget cause feedbacks on natural cloudiness; consideration
         of vertical overlap between AIC and natural clouds, as cloud overlap statistic has
         a profound impact on overall fractional cloud coverage within a model grid box and
         on net RF; realistic representation of AIC within the model’s radiation scheme, as
         optical properties differ from those of natural cirrus; and abandonment of instantaneous
         conversion of water vapour above ice saturation into cloud ice (and the reverse process
         below ice saturation), as ice crystal growth and sublimation can be kinetically hindered
         in thin or aged contrail cirrus; moreover, the kinetic treatment of water vapour uptake
         involving size-dispersed populations of disparate ice nuclei is a perquisite for the
         proper treatment of ice nucleation in models. Implementing these improvements will
         also lead to better simulations of natural cirrus.
