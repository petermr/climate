         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust RF estimates of this potential contribution to AIC RF are missing due to lack
            of observational evidence and uncertainties in underlying mechanisms and their parameterisation.
            Mechanisms include modification of ultrafine aqueous plume aerosols during transport
            from cruise altitudes to lower cloud levels and pre-activation of emitted soot particles
            in contrails. Given the small size and the substantial fraction of organic matter
            in aqueous plume particles and the largely insoluble nature of exhaust soot (Box 
            <a>1</a>), particles processed in ageing aircraft plumes
            <span><a>114</a></span> are neither expected to be efficient liquid cloud-nucleating particles nor potent
            heterogeneous ice nuclei. This casts doubt on their capability to facilitate cloud
            water droplet or ice crystal formation in atmospheric conditions. Pre-activation refers
            to an increase in an aerosol particle’s freezing temperature after ice nucleation
            occurred. While pre-activation has been observed in laboratory settings, it is not
            known whether it occurs on aircraft-emitted, small (&lt;100 nm) soot particles in the
            atmosphere or in contrails.

            by fuel composition (Box 
            <a>1</a>) but are not well represented in emission inventories used to initialise global models.
            They must be specified to estimate the formation and evolution of ultrafine aqueous
            plume particles. The sulphur dioxide (SO
            <sub>2</sub>) emission index in kerosene varies widely around a mean value ≈1 g (kg-fuel)
            <span>−1</span> depending on the origin of the crude oil
            <span><a>4</a></span>; most jet fuel has lower emissions. The fraction of SO
            <sub>2</sub> converted to condensable sulphuric acid at emission (few %) and the mass and chemical
            nature of emissions of condensable organic vapours are not well known. With regard
            to aircraft-emitted soot particles, emission inventories only provide mass-based soot
            emissions
            <span><a>115</a>–
               <a>117</a></span>—often as a single, fleet-averaged surface-level value—from which particle numbers
            at cruise are inferred using empirical correlations. This seriously underestimates
            variability in soot particle numbers in contrails at formation.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To parameterise aqueous plume particle formation and contrail ice nucleation properly
            in climate models, it is necessary to inform global aircraft emission inventories
            with additional sulphate/organics mass and soot particle number emissions. Such improved
            inventories better represent aviation activity and allow for more realistic simulations
            of the formation stage, AIC RF and effects on natural clouds by way of parameterisation.

            to represent effects of natural cirrus that are composed of ice crystals, whose mean
            maximum dimensions hardly fall below 10 µm. In dense flight corridors, AIC might on
            average be composed of such small ice crystals
            <span><a>17</a>,
               <a>118</a></span>. As neither geometric optics nor Mie theory accurately describe such cases, other
            optical models might be employed to provide more realistic parameterisations of ice
            crystal scattering properties in contrails and contrail cirrus. Shapes of small ice
            crystals are largely unconstrained by direct observations (Box 
            <a>2</a>), constituting a significant drawback in applying advanced optical parameterisations.
            Before being implemented in global models, such parameterisations might be tested
            in regional models providing more detailed information on ice crystal size and habit
            distributions. This better constrains SW radiative transfer calculations and helps
            improve estimates of AIC RF and climate sensitivity.

            at the Earth’s surface in cloudless scenes has been observed at several locations

            <span><a>120</a></span>). The observed trend was almost entirely due to an increase in the diffuse irradiance,
            while the direct component remained virtually unchanged, ruling out a concomitant
            decrease in atmospheric aerosol OD as the sole cause of the increase. Recent analyses
            using diffuse SW spectral measurements
            <span><a>121</a></span> confirmed this trend coined as ‘clear-sky whitening’. Ref. 
            <span><a>121</a></span> hypothesised that while a decreased aerosol load did increase the total SW irradiance,
            an increase in subvisible contrail-generated ice crystal ‘haze’ repartitioned this
            increase from the direct into the diffuse component. Formation and spreading stage
            processes including radiative effects of small ice crystals must be understood well
            to explore this plausible hypothesis.

            their variability affecting RF only to a degree, depending on the model’s representation
            of clouds. They track atmospheric motion and clouds with ≈10 min time steps and represent
            them with coarse spatial resolution. This means that formation and effects of clouds
            must be parameterised. Cloud microphysical and optical variables evolve on unresolved
            temporal and spatial scales. The connection of unresolved processes to resolved (large-scale)
            model variables is not always obvious. With higher resolution, fewer parameterisations

            <span><a>123</a></span> is very promising. More aircraft travelling in the same regions may not necessarily
            lead to more AIC coverage due to overlap effects and merging with natural cirrus,

            data and mean contrail OD in off-line radiative transfer models and used to diagnose
            global contrail RF in climate models have been replaced by simulations of AIC within
            global models
            <span><a>62</a></span>. Adding or elaborating on processes may be required to improve on specific problems.
            However, this would expand the space of underlying model parameters, possibly compromising
            the robustness of the models’ predictive capability and the goal of reducing overall
            model uncertainty
            <span><a>124</a></span>. Parameterisation schemes used in such models should therefore be informed by theory,
            whereby it is important to capture the most influential processes governing a specific
            application, and document the physical soundness and plausibility of the scheme. Understanding
            how well global climate models work for a specific purpose (evaluation) is important,
            but in itself is not a straightforward task. At times the disagreement of a model
            with observations motivates model improvements.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important task in support of model improvement is ascertaining its “truth”
            (validation), e.g., by comparison with suitable measurements. In models with many
            compensating uncertainties, several pathways of process representation conforming
            to the same set of underlying physical laws may lead to similar plausible agreement
            with observations. Just because models agree with some measurements does not imply
            reduced uncertainty in their RF predictions. In view of the case study nature of many
            measurements, observationalists and modellers should aspire to clarify if and exactly
            how measurements can be used to validate models and constrain uncertainty. Introducing
            microphysical mechanisms in cloud parameterisations without critical analysis, theoretical
            underpinning or support by empirical evidence increases the likelihood of model fallacies.
            Unexamined process representation carries the danger of proliferating unsubstantiated
            conclusions. The resulting enhanced uncertainty levels are difficult to judge and
            may be irreducible.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lack of rigorous model evaluation and validation has serious repercussions for the
            interpretation of model results. A way out could be to devise models based on a minimal
            set of processes with only a few open physical parameters and expounding meaningful
            ways of how model behaviour could be confirmed or falsified. Complexity would be added
            only when needed, fulfilling a methodological principle known as ‘Ockham’s razor’.
            To minimise AIC model uncertainty, ice cloud parameterisations should conform to a
            number of tenets: full inclusion of AIC into the model’s hydrological cycle, as cloud-induced
            changes in the moisture and heat budget cause feedbacks on natural cloudiness; consideration
            of vertical overlap between AIC and natural clouds, as cloud overlap statistic has
            a profound impact on overall fractional cloud coverage within a model grid box and
            on net RF; realistic representation of AIC within the model’s radiation scheme, as
            optical properties differ from those of natural cirrus; and abandonment of instantaneous
            conversion of water vapour above ice saturation into cloud ice (and the reverse process
            below ice saturation), as ice crystal growth and sublimation can be kinetically hindered
            in thin or aged contrail cirrus; moreover, the kinetic treatment of water vapour uptake
            involving size-dispersed populations of disparate ice nuclei is a perquisite for the
            proper treatment of ice nucleation in models. Implementing these improvements will
            also lead to better simulations of natural cirrus.
