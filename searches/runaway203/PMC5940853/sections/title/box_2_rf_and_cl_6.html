      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the top of the atmosphere, annually and globally averaged, incoming shortwave (SW,
         solar) radiation and the outgoing longwave (LW, thermal) radiation cancel out unless
         a climate forcing, such as changes in properties of clouds, perturbs this balance
         <span><a>134</a>,
            <a>135</a></span>. An initial perturbation of the radiation balance defines RF, a first-order indicator
         of the importance of different climate change mechanisms. RF refers to initial imbalances
         over a specified region and period of time; those provided by the IPCC
         <span><a>7</a></span> are global averages taken relative to a pre-industrial time (1750). Global RF cannot
         be observed directly and is therefore obtained with the help of models or by extrapolation
         of regional values inferred from satellite observations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">OD—measuring the opacity of a medium when electromagnetic radiation of a given wavelength,
         
         <span>λ</span>, passes through it—is a crucial determinant of RF. OD and RF are determined by a
         number of radiative transfer processes. Ice in high level clouds, i.e., thin cirrus
         and long-lived contrails, acts similar to cloud-free air (
         <span>a</span>): it decreases the energy lost to outer space, enhancing the temperature in the atmosphere
         below the cloud and at the Earth’s surface (cloud greenhouse forcing). Cloud ice crystals
         affect RF by reducing thermal emission (radiant energy with 
         <span>λ</span> &gt; 4 µm) to space via absorption and re-emission of LW radiation at cold temperatures.
         Contrary to low clouds composed mainly of liquid water droplets (
         <span>b</span>), high ice clouds are often optically thin (
         <span>c</span>,
         <span> d</span>), i.e., partially transparent to solar radiation (
         <span>λ</span> ≈ 0.2–4 µm), meaning their ability to scatter SW radiation back to space (albedo
         forcing) is small. The greenhouse forcing is stronger for higher and colder clouds,
         in which ice crystals are increasingly abundant. The net average diurnal RF due to
         thin cirrus and contrails is a small positive residual from the wavelength-integrated
         SW and LW forcings. RF contributions due to thickening of natural cirrus by embedded
         contrails and new ice crystal formation in contrail areas with low ice crystal concentrations,
         blurring the distinction between natural cirrus and contrail cirrus, have not yet
         been determined.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beside the power received from the Sun (solar irradiance) and Earth’s atmosphere,
         Earth surface conditions and vertical distribution (overlap) of clouds, wavelength
         dependent scattering and absorption properties of single ice crystals are needed to
         estimate OD and RF. Those properties depend on shapes (habits), surface roughness
         and orientation against incident light of cloud ice crystals across their size distribution,
         all of which are difficult to quantify in airborne measurements. Emissivity (absorption
         and emission at near infrared wavelengths, LW forcing) and reflectance (scattering
         at visible wavelengths, SW forcing) of high ice clouds are determined by OD and physical
         properties of ice crystals. Reflectance is sensitive to the habits of small ice crystals.
         Optical contrail models assume mixtures of various habits with fixed fractional weights
         <span><a>35</a>,
            <a>54</a>,
            <a>57</a>,
            <a>136</a>,
            <a>137</a></span>, but exactly which habits prevail and how individual habits vary with contrail age
         and ice crystal size is not well known.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Positive (negative) RF induces a warming (cooling) tendency that is subsequently communicated
         throughout the whole atmosphere. The strength of the resulting response in globally
         averaged, equilibrium near surface air temperature, Δ
         <span>T</span>, is estimated by the climate sensitivity parameter
         <span><a>134</a>,
            <a>138</a></span>, RF/Δ
         <span>T</span>. Values of this parameter and the associated equilibration times depend on the nature,
         spatial pattern and temporal evolution of RF and on the heat capacity of the climate
         system.
