 <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The specific land cover types selected by caribou in the fall and spring models varied slightly from year to year depending on the primary migration geography (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>, Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). However, the ranking of mean spring (2010–2017) selected land cover types closely matched the rankings for the pooled spring model (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). In spring, caribou selected (&gt; 1.00) for tussock tundra, tall shrub, and herbaceous (mesic) land cover types, in that order. Use of dwarf shrubs was predicted to occur in proportion to its availability (1.00), whereas lichen was used less than expected based on its availability (0.81–0.85). Rankings of land cover selection were the same as for the pooled spring model and the mean of the annual spring models. Similarly, caribou in the pooled fall model selected tussock tundra, tall shrub, and fire scar cover types (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). Mean land cover use in the annual fall models was the same as the order of the pooled fall model, although they differed in that herbaceous cover types were predicted to be used less than expected (0.42–0.48). Low selection indices for urban areas, ice/snow, mixed forest, and spruce forest in both the spring and fall pooled models reflect the lack of predicted use of this land cover type by caribou during migration (Table 
  <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>).
