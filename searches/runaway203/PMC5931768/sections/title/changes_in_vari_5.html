      <div>Changes in variability of the surface energy balance until the end of the 21st century.</div>
      <p>The horizontal axes in (
         <span>A</span>), (
         <span>B</span>), (
         <span>D</span>), and (
         <span>E</span>) show changes in the mean, whereas all other axes and the color bar show changes
         in SD. Each dot represents the difference between the periods 1875–1904 and 2055–2084
         at a particular land grid cell in the Southern Hemisphere without Antarctica (A to
         
         <span>C</span>) and the Northern Hemisphere without Greenland (D to 
         <span>F</span>) for the multimodel average. All figures show summer conditions (DJF in the Southern
         Hemisphere, JJA in the Northern Hemisphere). The blue coordinate system in (C) and
         (F) defines the index shown in 
         <a>Fig. 3</a>, with negative values indicating larger increases in LH variability and positive
         values indicating larger radiative variability.
