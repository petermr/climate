      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted increases in temperature variability in the identified hotspots suggest
         the potential for substantial impacts on top of the impacts caused by changes in the
         mean climate. Poor countries are located in the identified hotspot regions of increasing
         temperature variability. A growing body of climate-economy literature shows that poor
         countries are particularly vulnerable to weather and climate shocks, whereas rich
         countries tend to show no significant vulnerability (
         <a><span>2</span></a>, 
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>48</span></a>). Tropical temperature fluctuations are not only strongly correlated with a temporal
         loss of agricultural output, as might be expected from anomalous weather affecting
         crop productivity and yields (
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>9</span></a>). They also affect the economic growth rate of countries, leading to long-term economic
         disadvantages compared to the development of other nations (
         <a><span>3</span></a>). Moreover, it has been argued that high temperatures favor political instability
         and conflict in tropical countries (
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>49</span></a>), although this claim remains controversial (
         <a><span>50</span></a>). Like our own analysis, these studies are often based on monthly climate anomalies
         over many years and, thus, integrate many individual weather and climate events. The
         unequal projected regional changes in climate variability therefore constitute a matter
         of climate justice.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this, we calculate the relative changes in temperature SD for individual
         countries, omitting small countries that are usually not resolved in the models (see
         Materials and Methods). It is particularly striking that the geographical pattern
         of the changes in SD coincides closely with the current distribution of wealth on
         the national level (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>). Although temperature fluctuations are projected to become smaller in countries
         having a large per capita gross domestic product (GDP), they tend to increase in countries
         with low GDP. Hence, countries facing the largest increases in temperature variability
         also have the least economic potential to cope with the impacts. The countries affected
         by this dual challenge of poverty and increasing variability already share half of
         the world’s population (
         <a>Fig. 5</a>), and population growth rates are particularly large in these countries (see Materials
         and Methods for data sources).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unequal changes in projected climate variability are also a challenge for climate
         justice regarding the contributions of different nations to global climate change.
         Considering the average per capita emissions in the period 1990–2015 (excluding land
         use change and forestry), countries with the smallest emissions tend to have the largest
         increases in variability (fig. S7A), whereas those with the largest emissions tend
         to have smaller increases or even decreases in variability (Australia being a notable
         exception). The picture changes somewhat when including recent emissions from land
         use change and forestry (fig. S7B), bearing in mind that land use–related emissions
         are much more uncertain than emission estimates from fossil fuel burning. In the selected
         time period, tropical countries contributed a large fraction to land use–related emissions,
         associated with tropical deforestation especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia,
         and Southeast Asia.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the econometric studies mentioned above, it is hard to conclude what
         the exact impacts of changing climate variability will be. For example, it is important
         to assess to what extent the impacts caused by warm climate anomalies are compensated
         by cold anomalies. In general, an increase in temperature variability is arguably
         more difficult to cope with than a decrease in variability. Societies and ecosystems
         are typically adapted to a certain long-term climate at any particular location—the
         more an anomaly deviates from the local mean, the more damage it can thus cause. This
         is particularly important in the presence of critical thresholds, for example, in
         species performance (
         <a><span>6</span></a>). Several studies find nonlinearity in the effect of temperature anomalies, for example,
         on agriculture, mortality, and energy demand (
         <a><span>2</span></a>), indicating that the effects of warm and cold anomalies will not simply cancel out.
         Moreover, the distribution of daily temperature is projected to become more skewed
         to warm anomalies in many of the identified hotspot locations (
         <a><span>37</span></a>). It therefore seems plausible that, overall, the projected increases in temperature
         variability would have negative consequences for nature and society.
