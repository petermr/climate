  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanisms that we identify above are in line with previous studies that have usually focused on temperature extremes (extreme compared to current climate) and on shorter time scales (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
    <span class="italic">38</span>
   </a>). When comparing the occurrence of such extreme events between models and observation-based data sets, previous studies have usually found good agreement regarding their frequency and trend patterns (
   <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
    <span class="italic">39</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
    <span class="italic">40</span>
   </a>). Here, we briefly compare the modeled variability of monthly mean temperatures with four reanalysis data sets (see Materials and Methods for more detail): ERA-Interim (
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
    <span class="italic">41</span>
   </a>), NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis V2c (
   <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
    <span class="italic">42</span>
   </a>), NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2 (
   <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
    <span class="italic">43</span>
   </a>), and MERRA2 (
   <a rid="R44" ref-type="bibr" href="#R44">
    <span class="italic">44</span>
   </a>). Although locally constrained by observations, these reanalysis data sets allow a global and temporally complete coverage. We calculate the temperature SD in the period 1980–2010 for all models and the four reanalyses by linear detrending for each month and computing the SD of the residuals. Overall, our comparison confirms that the current temperature SD of the CMIP5 models is within the observational range (fig. S6). Regional biases occur mostly in high latitudes over areas of substantial variability in sea-ice cover and over some tropical land regions (fig. S6A). However, these model mean biases are comparable in magnitude with the typical differences between models (fig. S6B) and, over some regions, are also comparable to the differences between reanalysis data sets (fig. S6C).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CMIP5 models are particularly uncertain and biased in the Amazon. Although most models show a pronounced hotspot of future temperature SD increase, this is also the region where the magnitude of this increase is most uncertain. Overall, the regions that the models identify as hotspots of future temperature SD increase tend to have a positive bias, that is, the model average shows larger present-day variability than reanalyses (fig. S6A). However, selecting groups of models based on their overall sign of biases hardly affects the general pattern of changing temperature variability. Although there is a tendency for models with positive bias to also show larger increases in temperature SD in many places, this bias is relatively small compared to the predicted changes in most hotspot areas, and the position of hotspots and the relative magnitude of temperature variability changes in these regions are not substantially affected.</p>

   <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>) recently raised the question whether the predictions of the models are reliable or whether they share common biases in their predictions of temperature extremes, despite the overall agreement regarding the magnitude of observed variability. In the case that the model predictions are correct, the question arises whether the anthropogenic fingerprint is already apparent in observations of temperature variability. We therefore recalculate the changes in temperature SD for the period from 1958 to 2017 and compare the result to two observational data sets based on in situ measurements from meteorological stations: HadCRUT4 (
   <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">
    <span class="italic">45</span>
   </a>) and the GISS (NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies) Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) (see Materials and Methods) (
   <a rid="R46" ref-type="bibr" href="#R46">
    <span class="italic">46</span>
   </a>). These data sets report temperatures whose mean and variance have been standardized with a reference period. This procedure is known to introduce biases in variance changes (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>), although the effect is likely small here because the trends that we find in the observational data sets tend to also show up in the reanalyses that have no such bias (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At first sight, the observations do not agree well with the signal in the model predictions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). The most apparent features in observations are an increase in temperature SD in the Mediterranean region and a decrease in some parts of North America and Northern Europe (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>, A and B). In contrast, the tendencies of changes in temperature SD in the models already show the overall pattern that we analyzed above when all models are considered (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4C</a>). However, the model agreement is still relatively low, and the characteristic contrast between high and low latitudes is not apparent in individual models with very few exceptions. If we assume that each model is one realization of climate variability in the real world, then this means that we cannot expect to see the anthropogenic signal in recent observations. It is only during the 21st century that the signal emerges in the large majority of the models, with more than 80% of the models agreeing on the sign until 2100 over subtropical land and the mid- and high latitudes (fig. S1). Although the sign of variability change in observations can be very clear at places (indicated by a large absolute Kendall τ value), these observations still provide only one realization.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a recent companion study (
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">
    <span class="italic">17</span>
   </a>), we have shown that the sign of the observed temperature trends substantially depends on the choice of the time period, which confirms that the observed changes are largely related to internal climate variability and not a forced trend. The relatively robust decrease of observed variability over high northern latitudes in the North Atlantic region, however, might already be part of the anthropogenic signal (associated with sea-ice loss). Unfortunately, the regions with the largest model agreement in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4C</a> (tropical land areas and high latitudes)—where the anthropogenic signal can be expected to emerge the earliest—are also among the regions with the fewest observations. It is therefore hard to conclude whether current observations confirm or refute the predictions of models regarding trends in monthly temperature variability.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted increases in temperature variability in the identified hotspots suggest the potential for substantial impacts on top of the impacts caused by changes in the mean climate. Poor countries are located in the identified hotspot regions of increasing temperature variability. A growing body of climate-economy literature shows that poor countries are particularly vulnerable to weather and climate shocks, whereas rich countries tend to show no significant vulnerability (

   </a>, 
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
    <span class="italic">48</span>
   </a>). Tropical temperature fluctuations are not only strongly correlated with a temporal loss of agricultural output, as might be expected from anomalous weather affecting crop productivity and yields (
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
    <span class="italic">3</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">
    <span class="italic">9</span>
   </a>). They also affect the economic growth rate of countries, leading to long-term economic disadvantages compared to the development of other nations (
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
    <span class="italic">3</span>
   </a>). Moreover, it has been argued that high temperatures favor political instability and conflict in tropical countries (
   <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
    <span class="italic">3</span>
   </a>, 
   <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">
    <span class="italic">49</span>
   </a>), although this claim remains controversial (
   <a rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" href="#R50">
    <span class="italic">50</span>
   </a>). Like our own analysis, these studies are often based on monthly climate anomalies over many years and, thus, integrate many individual weather and climate events. The unequal projected regional changes in climate variability therefore constitute a matter of climate justice.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate this, we calculate the relative changes in temperature SD for individual countries, omitting small countries that are usually not resolved in the models (see Materials and Methods). It is particularly striking that the geographical pattern of the changes in SD coincides closely with the current distribution of wealth on the national level (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>). Although temperature fluctuations are projected to become smaller in countries having a large per capita gross domestic product (GDP), they tend to increase in countries with low GDP. Hence, countries facing the largest increases in temperature variability also have the least economic potential to cope with the impacts. The countries affected by this dual challenge of poverty and increasing variability already share half of the world’s population (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F5" href="#F5">Fig. 5</a>), and population growth rates are particularly large in these countries (see Materials and Methods for data sources).

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unequal changes in projected climate variability are also a challenge for climate justice regarding the contributions of different nations to global climate change. Considering the average per capita emissions in the period 1990–2015 (excluding land use change and forestry), countries with the smallest emissions tend to have the largest increases in variability (fig. S7A), whereas those with the largest emissions tend to have smaller increases or even decreases in variability (Australia being a notable exception). The picture changes somewhat when including recent emissions from land use change and forestry (fig. S7B), bearing in mind that land use–related emissions are much more uncertain than emission estimates from fossil fuel burning. In the selected time period, tropical countries contributed a large fraction to land use–related emissions, associated with tropical deforestation especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of the econometric studies mentioned above, it is hard to conclude what the exact impacts of changing climate variability will be. For example, it is important to assess to what extent the impacts caused by warm climate anomalies are compensated by cold anomalies. In general, an increase in temperature variability is arguably more difficult to cope with than a decrease in variability. Societies and ecosystems are typically adapted to a certain long-term climate at any particular location—the more an anomaly deviates from the local mean, the more damage it can thus cause. This is particularly important in the presence of critical thresholds, for example, in species performance (
   <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
    <span class="italic">6</span>
   </a>). Several studies find nonlinearity in the effect of temperature anomalies, for example, on agriculture, mortality, and energy demand (
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
    <span class="italic">2</span>
   </a>), indicating that the effects of warm and cold anomalies will not simply cancel out. Moreover, the distribution of daily temperature is projected to become more skewed to warm anomalies in many of the identified hotspot locations (
   <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
    <span class="italic">37</span>
   </a>). It therefore seems plausible that, overall, the projected increases in temperature variability would have negative consequences for nature and society.
