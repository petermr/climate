         <sub>4</sub> (CH
         <sub>4TKL</sub>) and CO
         <sub>2</sub> (CO
         <sub>2TKL</sub>) release from thermokarst lakes proportional to the amount of newly-thawed carbon
         that becomes vulnerable to microbial decomposition. The volume of this newly-thawed
         carbon expands vertically by talik growth in sub-lake sediments and horizontally by
         increases in the extent to which thermokarst lakes cover the landscape. Here we discuss
         how these two processes, vertical and horizontal growth, are captured in AThaw and
         how they compare to other modeling studies and observational evidence.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, AThaw simulates vertical talik growth rates beneath lakes as a function of
         atmospheric temperature anomalies, which in turn determine lake bottom temperatures
         and ultimately drive sub-lake sediment warming. Thaw rates are assumed to depend on
         soil ice contents, mean ground temperature, depth of the thaw front, and are tuned
         to reproduce talik deepening simulated by Kessler et al.
         <span><a>16</a></span>. For instance, AThaw simulates typical talik depth beneath lakes of 11 m (7.8–13.4 m,
         68% uncertainty range; 20 m max) in warm permafrost environments (i.e., mean annual
         soil temperatures close to 0 °C) with mineral soils by the year 2050 under RCP8.5.
         Our helicopter-borne electromagnetic measurements of sites with comparable climatic
         and soil conditions (i.e., relatively warm permafrost temperatures between −3 and
         −1°C) (Supplementary Information) have inferred lake talik growth of 8–15 m in &lt; 50
         years (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7</a>). It should be noted that advective heat transport by groundwater can accelerate
         vertical thaw; maximum reported thaw rates are up to a meter per year
         <span><a>78</a>,
            <a>79</a></span>. When accounting for the effect of ground subsidence in a modeling context, Westermann
         et al.
         <span><a>79</a></span> suggest that several meters of ground ice can be removed in less than a decade. The
         authors simulated a talik growth of 15 m by 2100 under RCP8.5 for a site characterized
         by yedoma ice complex in cold, continuous permafrost. In contrast, AThaw simulates
         6 m (4–8 m, 68% range) talik depth under comparable climatic conditions by end of
         the century. Therefore, given modeling and observational evidence, we consider that
         the thaw rates in sub-lake sediments simulated by AThaw are relatively conservative.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A second key AThaw model assumption concerns simulated thermokarst-lake expansion
         in a warmer climate. Central to this aspect is the question to which extent newly-formed
         thermokarst lakes will cover degrading permafrost landscapes in a warmer climate.
         AThaw assumes that future thermokarst-lake formation will strongly depend on soil
         conditions (e.g., ice content) and landscape morphology. Therefore, the model assumes
         different maximum lake formation extents for four different ice-rich soil type distributions
         in the permafrost region of the Arctic: mineral soil (Orthels and Turbels), organic
         soils (Histels), undisturbed yedoma, and refrozen thermokarst deposits in the yedoma
         region (Supplementary Table 
         <a>1</a>, Supplementary Figs 4 and 5). Orthels, Turbels and Histels follow the Northern Circumpolar
         Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD)
         <span><a>80</a></span>, while undisturbed yedoma and refrozen thermokarst deposits in the Pleistocene-aged
         ice-rich yedoma soil region are distinguished according to Strauss et al.
         <span><a>81</a></span> and Walter Anthony et al.
         <span><a>24</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mineral soils, AThaw assumes that newly-formed lakes can degrade a maximum fraction
         F
         <span>TKLmax</span> of 7% (4–9%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>) of the landscape. Given the large-scale dominance of mineral soils in the permafrost
         region soil carbon inventory (540 Pg C, NCSCD)
         <span><a>80</a></span>, this soil class contributes significantly to cumulative pan-arctic CH
         <sub>4TKL</sub> (at year 2100, 46% for RCP8.5, 28% for RCP4.5). Organic soils (120 Pg C, NCSCD)
         <span><a>80</a></span> are typically richer in ground ice than mineral soils and therefore AThaw assumes
         a factor two larger potential for the formation of new thermokarst lakes [F
         <span>TKLmax</span> of 14% (10–17%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>)]. This soil type contributes 17% for RCP8.5 and 14% for RCP4.5 to cumulative pan-arctic
         CH
         <sub>4TKL</sub>. AThaw explicitly accounts for ice- and organic-rich soils in yedoma regions, separated
         into undisturbed yedoma landscapes (80 Pg C)
         <span><a>81</a></span> and drained lake basins in the yedoma region that subsequently formed permafrost
         following lake drainage (refrozen thermokarst; 240 Pg C)
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>81</a></span>. Given the high ice contents of these yedoma-region soils
         <span><a>81</a>–
            <a>83</a></span>, both soil classes are assigned a high potential for the formation of new thermokarst
         lakes once rising temperatures have resulted in ground subsidence. Given the high
         volumetric ice contents of refrozen drained thermokarst lake basins (&gt; 50%)
         <span><a>81</a>,
            <a>83</a></span> in conjunction with its basin-type geomorphology, which favors water ponding
         <span><a>16</a></span>, AThaw assumes a maximum F
         <span>TKLmax</span> of 21% (11–27%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Refrozen thermokarst basins in the yedoma region cover only about 4% of the permafrost
         domain of the Arctic, but they contribute 28% under RCP8.5 (38% under RCP4.5) to cumulative
         pan-arctic CH
         <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100. The highest potential for new-lake formation is assumed for unaltered ice-rich
         yedoma soils, where volumetric segregated ice content is typically 47–53% and high
         wedge-ice volumes (~40%) further increase permafrost ice concentration
         <span><a>81</a></span>. Here AThaw assumes a F
         <span>TKLmax</span> of 33% (16–42%, 68% range; Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). Considering that thermokarst activity in ice-rich regions had degraded about 80%
         of the landscape in specific regions during the Holocene
         <span><a>24</a>,
            <a>81</a>,
            <a>84</a></span>, we consider a factor two reduced lake-forming potential plausible, especially under
         the assumption of strong future warming. While undisturbed yedoma landscapes constitute
         our carbon pool with the smallest areal extent (covering 0.41 million km
         <span>2</span>, 2% of the permafrost domain)
         <span><a>81</a></span>, they contribute 9% under RCP8.5 (20% under RCP4.5) to cumulated pan-arctic CH
         <sub>4TKL</sub> by 2100, revealing the importance of carbon release from deep deposits beneath abruptly-formed
         yedoma thermokarst lakes.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We derived estimates of present-day abrupt-thaw emissions from AThaw and independently
         from upscaling observations. The estimated emission range from AThaw [20 (7–49) Tg C-CO
         <sub>2</sub>e yr
         <span>−1</span>] represents the median and 68% uncertainty range for years 2011–2017 (Supplementary
         Data 
         <a>1</a>). The observation-based estimate (19–58 Tg C-CO
         <sub>2</sub>e yr
         <span>−1</span>) was derived by upscaling observed lake carbon fluxes from abrupt-thaw features (Fig. 
         <a>2b</a>) to the extent of observed gross lake expansion areas (5–15%) among pan-arctic regions
         during the past 60 years
         <span><a>21</a></span>. This range of gross lake expansion is comparable to our observation of gross lake-area
         increase in northern and western Alaska (i.e., 1999–2014, 1.1–1.7% gross lake area
         increase upscaled to 5–7% assuming similar expansion/formation rates over the past
         60 years; Supplementary Table 
         <a>3</a>, Fig. 
         <a>3</a>). We acknowledge that present-day emissions associated with abrupt thaw may be conservative
         since gross lake-area increases in some regions are higher (e.g., &gt; 50% in Quebec
         <span><a>85</a></span> and &gt; 23% in West Siberia
         <span><a>86</a></span>), potentially due to hydrological changes in addition to permafrost thaw.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The formation/expansion of new thermokarst-lake areas and subsequent sub-lake talik
         growth is not the only mechanism of abrupt permafrost degradation making newly thawed
         permafrost carbon available for microbial decomposition. Further contribution comes
         from talik growth of present-day lakes which have not yet formed a deep talik and
         still store large amounts of labile carbon in sub-lake sediments. For instance, on
         the Alaska North Slope, Arp et al.
         <span><a>17</a></span> demonstrated that a rapid decrease in lake-ice thickness and duration has already
         led to many shallow lakes transitioning from bed-ice fast lakes underlain by permafrost
         to floating ice lakes that have started to develop taliks. This talik formation takes
         place about 70 years before talik formation is projected for the adjacent terrestrial
         environment by top-down permafrost models in this cold continuous permafrost zone,
         a feedback process also not accounted for in AThaw or other models of permafrost degradation.
         These and other non-lake modes of abrupt thaw
         <span><a>13</a></span>, including coastal and river erosion, thermoerosional gully formation, thaw slumps,
         collapse of permafrost peat plateaus, and talik formation in upland terrestrial environments,
         which may occur sooner than predicted by large-scale models when finer resolution
         soil and vegetation properties are taken into account
         <span><a>49</a></span>, are not explicitly accounted for in the AThaw model description; hence, we consider
         our assumed F
         <span>TKLmax</span> values a conservative estimate of the abrupt thaw extent in the 21st century.
