      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our reanalysis of 21st-century CLM and AThaw model results brings to light four critical
         findings. First, accounting for abrupt permafrost thaw beneath lakes, which peaks
         mid-century in response to RCP8.5 atmospheric temperature rise (Supplementary Figs 4
         and 5), increases late 21st century circumpolar permafrost carbon emissions up to
         118% (49–235%, 68% uncertainty range) (Fig. 
         <a>4b</a>; Supplementary Data 
         <a>1</a>). Corresponding CPCRE is increased by 130% (62–265%, 68% uncertainty) over that from
         gradual top-down thaw alone (Fig. 
         <a>4h</a>), which was the basis of previous PCF assessments
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>6</a>–
            <a>8</a></span>. We acknowledge that the extent to which AThaw emissions affect CPCRE depends on
         the land-surface models used
         <span><a>6</a>–
            <a>10</a></span>, but in all cases would result in a significant increase. End-of-the-century weakening
         of the abrupt thaw lake contribution to CPCRE occurs because strong warming in RCP8.5
         ultimately leads to the loss of high CH
         <sub>4</sub>-emitting lakes through significant landscape-scale drainage
         <span><a>43</a>,
            <a>45</a></span>. Meanwhile, gradual top-down thaw increases at the end of the century

                  representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, are distinguished
                  for homogenous gradual thaw from CLM4.5BGC (brown) and heterogeneous abrupt thaw by

                  to abrupt thaw lakes is shown only for years 2018–2100, when the AThaw modeled carbon
                  release exceeds one standard deviation in simulated CLM permafrost carbon fluxes during
                  the 1950– 2017 reference period

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, while permafrost-carbon emissions from lakes are a similar magnitude under
         RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>6</a>), the impact of these increased emissions on CPCRE is more pronounced in the moderate
         forcing scenario (RCP4.5) compared to the strong (RCP8.5) forcing scenario (Fig. 
         <a>4g, h</a>), intensifying the need for policy makers to take permafrost carbon into account
         when evaluating climate mitigation scenarios
         <span><a>9</a></span>. Including the RCP4.5 median cumulative emissions from new thermokarst lakes [12.3
         (5.7–26.7, 68% uncertainty) Pg C-CO
         <sub>2</sub>e by 2100] nearly triples what has until now been accepted as the CPCRE from gradual
         thaw alone (6.4 Pg C-CO
         <sub>2</sub>e by 2100), resulting in a ≤162% increase (76–350%, 68% uncertainty) in circumpolar
         permafrost-carbon radiative forcing (Fig. 
         <a>4g</a>, Supplementary Data 
         <a>1</a>). High AThaw impact on CPCRE under RCP4.5 is caused by differences in the responses
         of gradual versus abrupt thaw dynamics to moderate climate forcing. In the gradual
         thaw setting for RCP4.5, atmospheric carbon uptake by plants growing in active layer
         soils is stimulated more than decomposition of soil organic matter. However, the same
         degree of warming triggers an acceleration of abrupt thaw via thermokarst-lake formation
         on up to 4.9% (3.0–6.6%, 68% uncertainty range) of the permafrost-dominated landscape
         (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>4</a>), a pattern consistent with independent thermokarst-lake modeling for northeast Siberia

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, CH
         <sub>4</sub>, not CO
         <sub>2</sub>, is the dominant driver of the CPCRE, responsible for up to ~70% of circumpolar permafrost-carbon
         radiative forcing this century (Fig. 
         <a>4g, h</a>, Supplementary Data 
         <a>1</a>). On a mass basis AThaw lake CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions are small relative to CO
         <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
         <a>4c, d</a>); however, persistent CH
         <sub>4</sub> emissions and their larger GWP
         <sub>100</sub> results in CH
         <sub>4</sub> contributing most of the radiative forcing from abrupt thaw (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>6</a>). Methane’s contribution to CPCRE may be still higher in CLM simulations where terrestrial
         soils do not dry following permafrost thaw
         <span><a>46</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, including AThaw lake formation increases cumulative old (

         <a>4a, b</a>). Although climate impact is independent of carbon age, 
         <span>14</span>C-flux monitoring is useful for assessing PCF changes and biogeochemical activation
         of a previously inert, large carbon pool as increasingly old permafrost thaws. While
         only a fraction of 21st-century gradual-thaw model emissions originates from permafrost

            <a>8</a></span>, Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>2</a>), talik expansion beneath lakes accelerates deep permafrost thaw, mobilizing older
         permafrost carbon on shorter time scales

         <span><a>48</a></span> compared to the deepest thawed material at the base of terrestrial active layers,

         lower than abrupt thaw lake emissions due to refreezing of taliks and colonization
