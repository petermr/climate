As disaster risk reduction generally aims to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk and to manage residual risk, it contributes to strengthening resilience and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development.

According to this declaration, by enhancing national implementation, countries will develop national portfolios of action on environment and health by the end of 2018, as standalone policy documents or parts of others, respecting differences in countries’ circumstances, needs, priorities and capacities. The portfolios should draw on Annex 1 to the Declaration, which is a compendium of possible actions to facilitate its implementation, focusing on the seven priority areas, including climate change and health [
