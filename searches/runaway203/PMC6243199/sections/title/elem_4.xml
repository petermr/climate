 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projected emission inventories from trans‐Arctic shipping during the period 2006–2099 were derived from simulated voyages computed by combining ESM‐projected sea ice distribution with projected Europe‐Asia trade. Transits take place when two conditions are met: (1) sea ice conditions enable technical access between Europe and Asia; (2) operating costs of shipping via the least‐cost Arctic route are lower than via the Suez Canal route. Full details are given in

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The methodology for calculating technical shipping access extends the approach of Stephenson and Smith (
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0056">2015</a>). Monthly projected sea ice concentration and thickness data are obtained from 10 ESMs shown to simulate well the observed climatology, trend, and seasonal amplitude of 20th‐century and early 21st‐century sea ice extent and volume (Jahn et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0025">2012</a>; J. Liu et al.,

   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0056">2015</a>). Monthly data are averaged across models to form the ensemble average of sea ice concentration and thickness from 2006 to 2099. Optimal least‐cost navigation routes are derived from ESM data following the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System framework (Transport Canada, 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0063">1998</a>) described in detail by Stephenson et al. (
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0057">2013</a>). Pairwise Europe‐Asia routes are computed using a least‐cost path algorithm between 4 European and 14 East Asian port regions (combining ports serving common regional markets) that are among the top 50 ports worldwide in 2010 
   <span class="italic">twenty‐foot equivalent unit</span> traffic (Containerisation International, 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0011">2012</a>). Route paths are allowed to vary to minimize transit time, encompassing coastal routes such as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage as well as direct transits over the North Pole.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to technical accessibility, Arctic routes require a cost incentive to justify their use over the traditional Suez Canal route. A cost incentive is assumed when the cost of transporting a unit of cargo via the Arctic is lower than via the Suez Canal. Owing to beam and draft limitations along the Northern Sea Route (Brigham et al., 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0004">1999</a>), a standard Panamax vessel (80,000 deadweight tons [dwt] capacity) is assumed for Arctic transits, while a larger 
   <span class="italic">New Panamax</span> (120,000 dwt capacity) is assumed for Suez transits (Stott, 
   <a rid="grl58008-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58008-bib-0058">2012</a>). Ships are assumed to operate at full capacity. The transport cost per unit of cargo (2010 dollars) via the Arctic is calculated as:

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emissions from Arctic shipping in a given month are derived from the aggregate fuel consumption of Arctic transits, determined from the number of fully laden transits (rounded up) using an 80,000‐dwt vessel that would be required to transport the quantity of traded goods projected for each Europe‐Asia port pair in a given month. Aggregate fuel consumption is calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption per transit by the number of required transits for each port pair, then summing for all port pairs. Gridded fuel consumption is estimated by distributing the aggregate quantity of fuel consumed over the least‐cost routes determined in section 
   <a rid="grl58008-sec-0005" ref-type="sec" href="#grl58008-sec-0005">2.1.1</a>, weighted by the number of vessels passing through the grid cell. Gridded fuel consumption is converted to emissions of BC, OC, and SO
