  <result pre="Ocean freshwater influx. This underlines that the global bathymetry and" exact="climate" post="state may be critical for the response of the"/>
  <result pre="the northern North Atlantic. Previous modelling studies have found that" exact="Arctic" post="closure can trigger an AMOC under early Eocene palaeogeography"/>

  <result pre="nor that the AMOC would be shut down when the" exact="Arctic" post="gateways are open. Furthermore, by testing our results in"/>
