  <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Large amounts of material are ejected into the atmosphere by large, explosive volcanic eruptions. This material consists of tephra (explosively fragmented magma), as well as volatiles (gases) in variable concentrations. Significant volcanic volatile compounds, influencing atmospheric conditions, are carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, which form sulfuric acid aerosols over a period of about one month, and halogens (e.g. chlorine and bromine), that play a major role in ozone chemistry

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>. Halogen compounds that reach the stratosphere contribute to catalytic ozone loss by releasing halogen radicals and interacting with enhanced sulfuric acid aerosol leading to increased ozone loss through heterogeneous chemistry

   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical eruptions with eruptive columns rapidly penetrating the tropopause directly inject volatiles in the form of gas, ice or salts precipitated on ash surfaces into the stratosphere where they are distributed globally by the large-scale meridional overturning circulation. Sulfuric acid aerosols and halogens then impact radiation, chemistry and dynamics of the stratosphere. The effects of volcanic sulfur emissions on the global climate is widely studied and accepted

For a future average CAVA eruption, the relative impact on stratospheric halogen loading would almost double again between present-day and 2100.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the potential atmospheric impacts of volcanic eruptions we use chemistry climate models. Getting reliable results from climate model simulations requires constraining the relevant parameters of the volcanic eruption. While satellite measurements provide the most appropriate atmospheric input parameters to evaluate volcanic impacts on the atmosphere and climate, very few (sub-)Plinian eruptions have occurred in the satellite era

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such databases of volatile release can be assessed for a variety of paleo-eruptions where the amount of volcanic gases released is estimated employing the petrological method. By measuring pre-eruptive (in melt inclusions) and post-eruptive (in matrix glass) gas contents of the magma and using the resulting difference together with the erupted magma mass, one can calculate the minimum amount of different volatiles released during an eruption, neglecting the potential amount of volatiles released through the fluid phase, and from that specify the range injected to the stratosphere

  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only few modeling studies concerning stratospheric implications of volcanic halogens and aerosols from explosive volcanism are known to us. In a study of the Bronze-Age eruption of Santorini (~1600 BCE) petrologically determined chlorine and estimated bromine degassing budgets, with 2% halogen injection efficiency, were used as input for the 2D Chemical Transport Model (CTM) with simplified internally generated zonal mean winds

Global ozone depletion reaches approximately 20% in the high volatiles scenario and the ozone layer takes about a decade to completely recover in this study. Similar to that, another 2D CTM study investigated volcanic eruptions under future climate emission scenarios co-injecting sulfur together with chlorine (and varying bromine background levels for sensitivity) of a Pinatubo strength eruption

In addition to atmospheric radiation, temperature, circulation and composition changes, we also evaluate the potential impact of global ozone loss on the biosphere by calculating the change in biologically active UV radiation reaching the Earth´s surface after such an eruption. We will discuss our results in light of the existing literature, before giving a summary and perspectives for future studies.
