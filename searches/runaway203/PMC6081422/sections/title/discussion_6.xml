 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The larger net moisture transport into the Arctic in the NP-Warm case results in enhanced Arctic surface warming through a number of processes and feedbacks: greater latent heat transfer from the subpolar extratropics to Arctic, greater increase in the area of low clouds in the Arctic and attendant absorption of infrared radiation, and greater amounts of atmospheric water vapor in the Arctic and attendant clear-sky absorption of infrared radiation. The relative magnitude of these effects discussed above (2.6 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> of increased total atmospheric energy convergence, 2.9 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> of increased cloud-sky surface longwave radiation, 10.7 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> of increased clear-sky surface longwave radiation, respectively) suggests that all three mechanisms play an important role in Arctic warming. There is additionally greater sea-ice decline, which increases surface radiation absorption through reduction in surface albedo (ice-albedo feedback) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6</a>). As sea-ice retreats, evaporation increases, driving additional low-cloud formation and atmospheric moistening. Changes in moisture transport from the sub-Arctic to the Arctic thus plausibly provide the initial driver for Arctic change and these changes are then amplified by local processes.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What facilitates greater moisture transport into the Arctic in the positive North Pacific heat flux perturbation relative to the positive North Atlantic heat flux perturbation? Plausible mechanisms include: topographic mediation of atmospheric flow trajectories, the different areal extent of the North Atlantic and North Pacific basins and attendant impacts on surface albedo and air–sea moisture exchange, or the land–sea configuration and associated atmospheric pressure anomalies related to land–sea thermal gradients.</p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the first hypothesis, we ran identical simulations to the NP-Warm and NA-Warm cases with global land topography equivalent to a geopotential height of sea level (NP-Warm-Notopo, NA-Warm-Notopo). These simulations show an overall similar pattern to the heat flux perturbations with realistic land topography (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), with surface air temperatures in the Arctic more strongly influenced by the positive heat flux anomalies sourced from the North Pacific (+3.23°C) than from the North Atlantic (+2.43°C) (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The reduction in topographic relief facilitates greater moisture transport from mid-latitudes to the Arctic, resulting in a slight increase in annual Arctic surface warming in both the NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo cases relative to the NP-Warm and NA-Warm cases, further supporting the central role of moisture transport as a major influence on the Arctic climate response. These results indicate that the atmospheric flow patterns influenced by land topography are not the causal mechanism for the greater moisture fluxes into the Arctic arising from the North Pacific heat flux anomalies (relative to the North Atlantic heat flux anomalies).
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the second hypothesis, we reconfigured the North Pacific heat flux anomaly to an area equivalent to the North Atlantic heat flux anomaly (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>) and ran an additional simulation with a positive heat flux anomaly in the Northeast Pacific (NEP-Warm). The NEP-Warm simulation results in a slightly reduced mean Arctic and global surface warming (2.55 ± 0.68 and 0.91 ± 0.24°C, respectively) relative to the original NP-Warm simulation (3.08 ± 0.20 and 0.95 ± 0.03°C, respectively), however, these changes are still greater than the equivalent area NA-Warm case (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">8</a>). The larger errors associated with the NEP-Warm simulation in part reflects a more limited integration window (40–60 yr compared to 40–100 yr for the other simulations). However, the global temperature evolution of the NP-Warm and NEP-Warm simulations are statistically indistinguishable from one another throughout the entire overlapping simulation interval (1–60 yr: Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). This indicates that the greater area of the North Pacific heat flux relative to the North Atlantic heat flux anomaly in the original simulations does not have an appreciable effect on the resulting global and Arctic surface temperature response, at least in so far as we can ascertain from our simulations here.
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commonalities between the sea-level pressure anomalies in the simulations with no topography and realistic land topography provide insight into atmospheric pressure patterns that are primarily controlled by land–sea thermal contrasts rather than topography (the third hypothesis). Sea-level pressure changes in the NA-Warm simulation produce a high-pressure anomaly over the North Pacific that is most pronounced in winter (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>), indicating a general weakening of the Aleutian Low in response to a positive North Atlantic heat flux. A stronger Aleutian Low is associated with the transport of warm moist air from the North Pacific into the Arctic through the Bering Strait
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, whereas a weakened Aleutian Low shifts the North American ridge into the central Pacific, where it effectively blocks west-to-east propagating storm systems that carry moisture northward
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span>. In contrast, the NP-Warm simulation produces a low-pressure anomaly that extends from the Northeastern Pacific into the Arctic during winter.
 </p>
 <p id="Par23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo sea-level pressure anomalies result in a more homogenous northern hemisphere pattern than the NP-Warm and NA-Warm sea-level pressure anomalies (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>), which exhibit strong differences in their response over the North Pacific. Nevertheless, both the NP-Warm and NP-Warm-Notopo simulations do share a common low-pressure ‘breach’ along the Northeastern Pacific and North American continent that punctures the high-pressure ring encircling the Arctic from 45 to 60°N. In contrast, NA-Warm-Notopo exhibits a sea-level pressure pattern more in line with a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, with a continuous high-pressure ridge that helps to isolate the Arctic from subtropical heat and moisture intrusions.
 </p>
 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We thus infer that the land–sea configuration is likely the primary mechanism that leads to greater moisture flux into the Arctic in response to the North Pacific heat flux anomalies. Some of the asymmetry in the Arctic climate response to North Pacific or North Atlantic heat fluxes in our simulations may in part be related to model biases or poor representations of cloud physics and shallow convective processes, such as the overly strong Pacific center of the wintertime Arctic Oscillation observed in many climate models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>, or the tendency for models to underestimate moisture intrusions to the Arctic through the North Atlantic gateway and overestimate moisture intrusions from the Pacific sector
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span>. However, the fact that much of the total latent heat energy entering the Arctic is channeled through the North Atlantic gateway in response to North Pacific warming (NP-Warm; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>) makes it unlikely that this latter factor
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
  </span> can fully account for the asymmetries in the poleward moisture transport in the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations.
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the stronger Arctic temperature response elicited from the North Pacific (in comparison to North Atlantic) heat flux anomalies, the global temperature response is more sensitive to North Pacific warming and cooling, implying enhanced climate sensitivity to SST perturbations in this region (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>, Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). However, our simulations do not have bearing on the sensitivity of the Arctic to changes in heat fluxes northward of 60°N, which is today a region of high ocean heat flux due to deep water formation in the Nordic Seas, and may thus be a potentially dynamic region for changes in ocean heat flux in the past
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>
  </span>. Nevertheless, changes in ocean heat flux sourced from the North Pacific have been largely overlooked as a mechanism for Arctic change in the past, in part due to a weaker modern overturning circulation compared to the Atlantic, which results in smaller magnitudes of ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). However, both paleoclimate data and modeling studies suggest the patterns of ocean heat flux and circulation between the North Atlantic and North Pacific may have been significantly different or even reversed in the past
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
  </span>. Our simulations suggest that more diffusely distributed ocean heat fluxes in the North Pacific may have the capacity to exert stronger influences on global and Arctic climate than more concentrated heat fluxes in the North Atlantic through modulations in low-cloud cover and poleward moisture transport.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the slab-ocean configuration limits the assessment of ocean feedbacks that may amplify or dampen the atmospheric feedbacks outlined here, these simulations highlight the strong downwind impacts of ocean thermal anomalies; SST changes in the North Pacific can have substantial impacts on the Atlantic sector of the Arctic, and SST changes in the North Atlantic can influence the Northwestern Pacific and Pacific sector of the Arctic. Our results are broadly consistent with surface air temperature anomaly patterns generated in a coupled general circulation model in response to forced SST cooling in the North Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>
  </span>. We note that North Atlantic heat flux anomalies result in relatively weak SST anomalies in the Northeastern sector of the Pacific in our study, consistent with many model studies that exhibit either weak or even reversed temperature anomalies in the Northeastern Pacific in response to forced perturbations in North Atlantic circulation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>
  </span>. In contrast, past SST reconstructions suggest that SST changes of similar magnitudes between the North Atlantic and Northeastern Pacific occurred in conjunction with abrupt Arctic changes
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>), challenging the pervasive assumption that abrupt North Pacific warming events in the past were merely a downwind response to North Atlantic ocean circulation changes. Collectively, these data and model results may instead point towards unidentified mechanisms of North Pacific “regime shifts” that result in amplified SST warming along the Northeastern Pacific.
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Models predict the greatest SST increases in the North Pacific in the coming century, with SSTs up to 3°C greater than equivalent latitudes in the North Atlantic, attributed to the shallow North Pacific mixed layer depth, which allows a more rapid equilibration with atmospheric temperature increase
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>
  </span>. This “North Pacific Rapid Response” may help to provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the initiation of rapid SST changes in the North Pacific that coincide with the timing of rapid pulses of atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the past, as well as the close coupling of SSTs in the Northeastern Pacific with trends in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> over the past 18,000 years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>). The North Pacific Rapid Response may act to propagate and amplify the signal of radiative forcing through close coupling with Arctic amplification feedbacks.
 </p>
 <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations suggest that surface ocean warming in the North Pacific may have a particularly pronounced effect on Arctic temperature and sea-ice extent, and may help to explain the record-breaking Arctic surface warming and sea-ice decline in recent years
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span> that accompanied unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Northeast Pacific
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>
  </span>. Observational records indicate low clouds have been increasing in the Arctic in the past few decades, especially in the Beaufort-Laptev region, and are associated with declines in sea ice and warmer surface air temperatures in winter, spring, and autumn
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. The North Pacific has been identified as the dominant moisture source to this region of the Arctic in recent decades
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>
  </span>, where enhanced moisture transport is associated with accelerated sea-ice retreat
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the unprecedented decline in Arctic sea-ice extent in 2007 has been linked to anomalous heat and moisture intrusions from the Northwestern Pacific, through an accompanying increase in downwelling longwave radiation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, our experiments reveal a strong global and Arctic climatic dependence on the magnitude of water vapor and latent heat transfer from the mid-latitude oceans to the Arctic, with accompanying cloud, ice-albedo, and temperature responses that enhance Arctic warming. This linkage implies that projections of Arctic climate are highly sensitive to subpolar extratropical surface ocean temperature changes, making it essential to accurately estimate the magnitude of SST increase likely to occur in northern hemisphere oceans in response to rising greenhouse gases. Systematic cold biases in North Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs in CMIP5 models
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span> may thus partly lead to an underestimation of Arctic warming and sea-ice decline in climate projections, with important ramifications for climate and ecological tipping points in the Arctic.
