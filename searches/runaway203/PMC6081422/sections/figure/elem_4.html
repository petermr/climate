         <p>Decompositions of atmospheric energy transport. The total atmospheric energy transport
            across latitude, decomposed into dry static energy (sensible heat and geopotential
            energy terms) and moist (latent heat term) energy (
            <span>a</span>). Control values are in gray (as absolute values), NA-Warm anomalies relative to
            the control are in red, and NP-Warm anomalies are in blue. Inset shows a blow-up of
            the difference in the two cases from 60 to 90°N. The increase in latent heat transport
            dominates the total change in northward atmospheric energy transport, and is greater
            in the NP-Warm case relative to the NA-Warm case. 
            <span>b</span> A zonal decomposition of the northward latent heat transport across the Arctic boundary
            (66.6°N), depicting the longitudinal distribution of the change in latent heat transport
            (i.e., moisture intrusions), with the Pacific and Atlantic basins shaded in light
            gray for reference. The values in the upper right corner depict the total latent heat
            transfer (integrated throughout the atmosphere) across the Arctic boundary. Control
            values are the dashed line (as absolute values), whereas the NA-Warm anomalies are
            in red, and NP-Warm anomalies are in blue
