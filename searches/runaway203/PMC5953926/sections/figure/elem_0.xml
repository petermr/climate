  <p>A schematic of some important radiative and non-radiative feedbacks in polar regions involving the atmosphere, the ocean, sea ice and ice sheets. TOA refers to the top of the atmosphere. Solar radiation (in yellow) and Infrared Radiation (in red) represent the shortwave (solar) and longwave (infrared) radiation exchanges. A red plus sign means that the feedback is positive, a negative blue sign corresponds to a negative feedback. Both signs are present for cloud feedbacks as both positive and negative feedbacks are occurring simultaneously and the net effect is not known. The gray line on the right represents a simplified temperature profile in polar regions for the atmosphere and the ocean, the dashed line corresponding to a strong surface inversion. Oceanic and atmospheric heat transport are mentioned but without signs as the processes involved are not restricted to polar regions and it is not clear if they could be formally expressed using a closed feedback loop</p>
