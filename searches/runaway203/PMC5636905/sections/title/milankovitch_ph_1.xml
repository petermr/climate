  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). At our study sites in the Great Basin, lowest meteoric precipitation δ

  <sub>ivc</sub> values for the Leviathan chronology show pronounced orbital-scale variability that exhibit clear correlative peaks to NHSI (Fig.

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>), each of which matches the unique triplet of low/high/very low insolation during ISS 6.0/5.5/5.4. We show for the first time the phasing relationships between climate and NHSI over the last two glacial cycles. Out of ten insolation-correlative features in the δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> record, nine show delays (from 700 to 6600 yr) to NHSI, and the lags exceed the 2σ age uncertainties determined from time series age model uncertainties (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>; see methods). Only ISS 3.1 appears to lead NHSI (by ~900 yr). Considered together, the average phase lag for the 175 ka Leviathan record is 3240 years with a range of −900 to 6600 years, approximately 25% smaller than the 4800 years by which global ice volume lags precession
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. The shorter lag time for Leviathan than global ice volume may be related to chronological uncertainties with the marine benthic δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O record, but it may also reflect the faster response time of Great Basin paleoclimate to sea ice and snow cover changes in the Arctic, which would have responded more rapidly to insolation changes than ice sheet extent. We also show for the first time that Great Basin δ
  <span class="sup">18</span>O
  <sub>ivc</sub> is linearly related to NHSI, suggesting a linear response (r = 0.89, p-value = 0.002) between forcing and paleoclimate in the Great Basin (Figure

These durations are close to those predicted for Milankovitch forcing, being approximately ½ the 19,000 and 23,000 year precession cycles, respectively.
