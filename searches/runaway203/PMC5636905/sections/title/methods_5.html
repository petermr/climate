      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ages on Nevada stalagmites were determined on a ThermoElectron Neptune multi-collector
         inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the University of New Mexico Radiogenic
         Isotope Laboratory, and stable isotope values were determined on a Kiel IV automated
         carbonate preparation device at the Las Vegas Isotope Science laboratory at UNLV directly
         coupled to a ThermoElectron Delta V stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer in dual
         inlet mode
         <span><a>8</a></span>. The time series of the vadose zone stalagmite δ
         <span>18</span>O values were adjusted for the change in δ
         <span>18</span>O of the ocean (denoted δ

         <span>18</span>O values that does not affect the shape or timing of the composite isotope curve.

         <sub>ivc</sub> record presented here includes a correction for the age of nine stable isotope samples
         (and the derivative interpolated time series) beneath a hiatus at 290.5 mm. This changes
         the age of the last isotope sample (291 mm) before the hiatus to 73,647 from 69,622 yr
         B2k. The age correction does not change any interpretations of this or previous work.
         We estimated age uncertainties for individual stalagmite age models using the COPRA
         software
         <span><a>56</a></span>, and interpolated age uncertainties at the 95‰ level for each climate event in Table 
         <a>1</a> in the Leviathan chronology.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the DH2-D record is significantly dampened relative to the Leviathan signal
         due to aquifer mixing and dispersion (Figure 
         <a>S4</a>; see text for explanation), we corrected the measured δ
         <span>18</span>O values by changes in δ
         <span>18</span>O of the ocean that were scaled by a ratio of 0.4551, which is the ratio of the standard
         deviations of the Leviathan and DH2-D records, respectively. This ice volume correction
         more accurately reflects how a given precipitation isotopic signal is filtered and
         dampened via transit through the aquifer feedings Devils Hole better than the undampened
         correction
         <span><a>47</a></span>. Because of our different ice volume correction, the timings and amplitudes of DH2-D

         <span><a>11</a></span>. The reason for using filters instead of raw data is to minimize the possible effects
         of noise on the choice of start and end points to provide more objective and reproducible
         results, though the latter approach may also be valid. Relative timings of insolation
         sub-stages were determined by differencing correlative ages. Phasing diagrams show
         the timing differences between the forcing (insolation) and the climate response in
         the Leviathan and DH2-D filtered records.
