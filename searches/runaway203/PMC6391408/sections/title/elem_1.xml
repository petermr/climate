  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that future societal choices about land use and land management will have dramatic impacts on riverine TN loading; across the six prototypical scenarios examined here, impacts range from an increase of 54% (SSP4-3.4 Inequality (3.4)) to a decrease of 7% (SSP5-8.5 Fossil-fueled development) by the end-of-the-century for the continental United States (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) in the absence of changes in precipitation patterns. Differences in riverine TN loading depend on the scales of agricultural production and anthropogenic nitrogen input, which in turn depend on global demand for food, demand for bioenergy, assumptions about trade, and assumptions about agricultural management practices. Demand for food depends on global population, income, and diet, while bioenergy depends on the degree of climate mitigation and the cost and availability of mitigation options. For the continental United States, the SSP4-3.4 scenario, which assumes low emissions, high climate mitigation, and moderately high demand for domestic food production, would increase TN loading by 54% (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1b</a>), due primarily to increased production of bioenergy, and associated fertilizer application
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>. Similarly, the projected increases in TN loading for the SSP3-7.0 Regional rivalry scenario is also due to an expansion of agricultural land in the United States, but this time resulting from rising demand for domestic food production
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>. For the SSP4-6.0 Inequality (6.0) scenario, the projected increase in TN loading arises from a high demand for both food and bioenergy production, with the latter being lower than for the SSP4-3.4 scenario
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>. In contrast, the SSP5-8.5 scenario associated with very high greenhouse gas emissions would lead to a modest decrease in future TN loading of 7%, attributable to a small growth in population in the United States and no climate mitigation efforts, resulting in lower agricultural demand and fertilizer use. Any increase in food demand within the United States would be met by livestock intensification, improvements in fertilizer use efficiency, and increased import of food
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
   </span>. Overall, the majority of examined scenarios are associated with increased TN loading, and the magnitudes of these increases outweigh the decreases for the remaining scenarios. The most dramatic projected changes would occur for the end-of-the-century period (2071–2100), although changes ranging from an increase of 16% to a decrease of 13% are also projected by the middle-of-the-century (2031–2060; Supplementary Figures

  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we find that some scenarios that are beneficial in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., SSP1-2.6 and SSP4-3.4) may result in massive increases in nitrogen loading, pointing to exacerbated eutrophication as an unintended consequence of climate mitigation. In contrast, high-emission scenarios (e.g., SSP5-8.5) could lead to modest amelioration of eutrophication within the continental United States. Other scenarios outside of the range considered here are of course also possible
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
   </span>. This finding points to a potential trade-off between goals of mitigating climate and eutrophication; however, climate change mitigation can also be achieved in more sustainable ways that reduce the unintended consequences of environmental degradation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>. To some extent this is achieved in the SSP1-2.6 scenario as implemented by the IMAGE IAM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>
   </span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1a, b</a>), which demonstrates that aggressive climate mitigation can in principle be achieved with minimal increases in nutrient loading. The remaining scenarios, which are associated with a large intensification of domestic food production (SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0) achieve neither goal, with little climate mitigation (i.e., high-fossil fuel consumption) but also substantial potential increases in eutrophication. Overall, these scenarios demonstrate that the benefits of climate change mitigation strategies should be assessed in a manner that also accounts for their impacts on eutrophication and the sustainability of water resources more broadly, such that climate mitigation strategies can be developed that limit unintended environmental impacts.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The possible magnitude of changes to TN loading resulting from the land use and land management scenarios considered here (up to 54% by the end-of-the-century) is even greater than the magnitude of possible TN loading increases due to future changes in precipitation (up to 19% by the end-of-the-century) reported in an earlier study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>. In addition, the range of possible changes across the six scenarios considered here (+54 to −7%), which can be thought of as an approximate measure of uncertainty in future TN loading changes resulting from anthropogenic activity within the continental United States, is also substantially larger than the range across future climate outcomes (+11% to +19%
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>). This comparison indicates that changes to the physical climate system must be considered when evaluating risks associated with future eutrophication, but that anthropogenic activity within the affected regions (via land use and land management) has an even stronger potential influence on loading.
  </p>
  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How society will evolve in the future is uncertain, even under a common set of high-level assumptions about economic futures and population dynamics. As a result, the assumptions prescribed for each societal pathway manifest themselves differently as a function of the IAM used to represent the pathway (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). In the LUH2 dataset, the scenarios for the SSP4-3.4 and SSP4-6.0 scenarios are based on simulations from the GCAM model
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>, while the four other scenarios are based on four other IAMs (Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Examining differences in scenarios generated by different IAMs for a given combination of socioeconomic development pathway and climate outcome gives a qualitative sense of both the uncertainty associated with societal response under given assumptions, and the model uncertainty associated with the use of any particular IAM. With this goal in mind, here we compare total fertilizer use projections from the LUH2 database to projections for all six scenarios based on the GCAM model. We do not compare impacts on TN loading directly, because spatially explicit and harmonized GCAM outputs are not available for all six scenarios; however, the differences in fertilizer use (which stem from changes in land use and changes in fertilizer application rate) would result in corresponding differences in loading if the requisite data were available. The GCAM model implementation of the SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios result in much larger cropland area and fertilizer usage relative to the corresponding marker scenarios in the LUH2 database, because the GCAM scenario assumes a much stronger reliance on biofuels. More broadly, for the four SSPs for which GCAM was not used as the LUH2 marker scenario, the average magnitude of the difference in fertilizer usage in 2100 between the GCAM implementation of a given scenario and the corresponding LUH2 marker scenario is 8.1 Tg N, which is greater than the full spread across the LUH2 database for these four scenarios (7.0 Tg N, Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). Recently released global fertilizer usage estimates for the five SSPs used here based on the IMAGE IAM also illustrate the differences implied by the choice of IAM
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. These large differences across IAMs highlight the uncertainty in societal outcomes even under a common set of driving assumptions.

  </p>
  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impacts of societal pathways on nitrogen loading are highly variable across regions, with the relative magnitude of some of the regional impacts dwarfing those observed at the continental scale (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For instance, all six scenarios would result in a robust increase in loading for the Northeast region by the end-of-the-century relative to the historical period, with increases ranging from 17% (SSP5-8.5) to 374% (SSP3-7.0). Conversely, three of the scenarios that would result in increased loading for the continental United States by the end-of-the-century would actually result in a decreased loading within the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB), namely the SSP1-2.6, SSP4-6.0, and SSP3-7.0 scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The projected decrease in future MARB loading relative to the historical period (1976–2005) is due to a decrease in cropland area between 1997 and 2015 that is not fully offset by land use changes through to the middle-of-the-century and end-of-the-century periods (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The scale and heterogeneity in regional impacts indicates that impacts of broader societal pathways may be highly geographically uneven, with clear winners and losers in terms of impacts on eutrophication. In the case of the Northeast and the MARB, both of these regions already have high historical loading (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), such that any long-term trends are likely to have important consequences on regional water quality. The risks and uncertainty associated with regional differences in impacts are further compounded by differences across IAMs in their representations of specific scenarios (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We further find that change in cropland area, developed area, and fertilizer application rate are all important contributors to future changes in TN flux (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> reproduces the information from Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a> with historical climate, but also illustrates the changes in loading resulting only from changes to cropland area (and associated fertilizer application), only from changes to developed land area, and only from changes in fertilizer application rates. For most scenarios and regions, more than one of these factors contributes substantially to the overall impact. As described earlier, the primary driver of the projected changes to cropland area is increased biofuel production for the SSP1-2.6 and SSP4-3.4 scenarios
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>,

   </span> (Supplementary Figure

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>. The primary drivers of projected changes to developed land area are population growth and rates of urbanization. For fertilizer application rates, the primary drivers mirror those of changes to cropland area.

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The discussion up to this point has focused on the impacts of changes in land use and land management in response to broader societal shifts, as represented by the LUH2 scenarios and additional scenarios from the GCAM IAM. We now shift to accounting for the compound impacts of changes in land use and land management as well as changes in precipitation patterns resulting from climate change.</p>
  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concomitant climate-induced changes in precipitation can either amplify TN flux increases or negate TN flux reductions due to land management, and the impacts of land use and land management and those of climate are not necessarily simply additive (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). For example, the reductions in TN fluxes for the continental United States resulting from anticipated changes in land use and land management for the SSP2-4.5 and the SSP5-8.5 (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) scenarios would be fully offset by the impacts of projected changes in precipitation patterns. For the four other scenarios, the increases in TN fluxes would be further amplified by projected changes in precipitation patterns. As expected, the additional impact of climate would be greatest for scenarios associated with more extensive changes to climate (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). Taken together, whereas the range of anticipated changes in the absence of concomitant changes to climate is −7 to 54% for the continental US, this range becomes 1–68% when both sets of drivers are taken into account. In addition, as previously noted
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span>, the impacts of climate-change-induced precipitation changes are themselves regionally heterogeneous. The Northeast exhibits the strongest impacts both when considering land management alone (with loading increases ranging from 17 to 374%) and when considering the additional impacts of climate change (with total loading increases from both drivers ranging from 45 to 492%). In addition, in some cases the impacts of land management and climate changes are not additive (e.g., SSP3-7.0 scenario in the Northeast; Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1f</a>), illustrating the importance of considering these two sets of drivers concurrently. It is noteworthy that for some scenarios such as SSP2-4.5, decreases in nutrient loading due to changes in land management can help to offset increases in loading that would result from changes in precipitation patterns associated with the corresponding climate outcome. Such examples point to the possibility of not only limiting impacts of land management change on nutrient loading (as discussed earlier), but indeed of using land management to address eutrophication resulting from changes to the physical climate system.
  </p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beyond the United States, Asian regions that have previously been identified as being particularly susceptible to increases in eutrophication as a result of future changes in precipitation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span> also exhibit large projected future increases in cropland area and total fertilizer usage across the majority of prototypical pathways examined here (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>, Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), suggesting that the overall scale of direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts is likely to be substantially larger than when considering climate alone. Globally, among regions with nonzero fertilizer use during the historical period (colored land regions in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>), the direction of change in fertilizer usage is consistent for at least five of the six examined scenarios for 67% of land area (colored regions in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). Regions in South, East, and Southeast Asia stand out relative to other regions in having both high-historical fertilizer usage and a robust and large projected increase in fertilizer use, placing them at a high risk for a substantial future increase in eutrophication. These regions also coincide with those identified in an earlier study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>
   </span> as being at high risk for future increases in eutrophication based on their high-historical precipitation and robust projected future increase in precipitation. When taken together, these two sets of analyses indicate that climate and societal changes are likely to conspire in this region to substantially impact inland and coastal water quality. Such intensified eutrophication could substantially impact water supplies, fisheries, and ecosystems. It is important to note, however, that the prototypical pathways examined here do not cover all possible outcomes, which will depend in no small part on policy and legislative action by individual countries. For example, future nitrogen use efficiency may improve in China and India as both countries are now increasing efforts to reduce nitrogen pollution by encouraging farmers to adopt best management practices

  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, we find that societal choices about land use and land management will have dramatic impacts on future nitrogen loading within the continental United States. In some cases, climate mitigation efforts could result in unintended increases in eutrophication, but opportunities to concurrently limit climate change and eutrophication do exist. Climate-induced changes in precipitation will exacerbate any loading increases due intensification of land use, or reduce the benefits of improved land management. Globally, South, East, and Southeast Asia will likely experience increased eutrophication by the end-of-the-century given projected trends in land use, land management, and precipitation across the majority of scenarios examined here. These results imply that strategies aimed at reducing eutrophication and associated water quality impacts must be based on an assessment of the combined impacts of changes in socioeconomic development and climate. Whereas some societal pathways can achieve climate mitigation while increasing food production, other mitigation pathways may have significant detrimental impact on environmental sustainability.</p>
