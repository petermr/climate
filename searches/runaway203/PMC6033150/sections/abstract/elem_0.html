      <p>The most pronounced warming in the historical global climate record prior to the recent
         warming occurred over the first half of the 20th century and is known as the Early
         Twentieth Century Warming (ETCW). Understanding this period and the subsequent slowdown
         of warming is key to disentangling the relationship between decadal variability and
         the response to human influences in the present and future climate. This review discusses
         the observed changes during the ETCW and hypotheses for the underlying causes and
         mechanisms. Attribution studies estimate that about a half (40–54%; 
         <span>p</span> &gt; .8) of the global warming from 1901 to 1950 was forced by a combination of increasing
         greenhouse gases and natural forcing, offset to some extent by aerosols. Natural variability
         also made a large contribution, particularly to regional anomalies like the Arctic
         warming in the 1920s and 1930s. The ETCW period also encompassed exceptional events,
         several of which are touched upon: Indian monsoon failures during the turn of the
         century, the “Dust Bowl” droughts and extreme heat waves in North America in the 1930s,
         the World War II period drought in Australia between 1937 and 1945; and the European
         droughts and heat waves of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Understanding the mechanisms
         involved in these events, and their links to large scale forcing is an important test
         for our understanding of modern climate change and for predicting impacts of future
         change.
