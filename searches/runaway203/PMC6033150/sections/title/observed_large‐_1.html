      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our knowledge of climate during the ETCW is mostly based on conventional weather observations
         at the Earth's surface, ship measurements, and some climate proxies, even though data
         rescue activities now aim at complementing the global climate record in this time
         period (Allan et al., 
         <a>2011</a>). Data coverage is further hampered by the two World Wars. Sea ice information is
         important, but limited in coverage. Oceanic data are equally sparse and sea‐surface
         temperatures (SSTs) are subject to biases, such as those the 1940s (Kennedy, Rayner,
         Smith, Parker, &amp; Saunby, 
         <a>2011</a>; Thompson, Kennedy, Wallace, &amp; Jones, 
         <a>2008</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
         <a>1</a> shows globally averaged anomalies of near‐surface air temperature over land and SSTs
         over oceans from HadCRUT4 and a proxy‐based global scale reconstruction (Crowley et
         al., 
         <a>2014</a>). Other global temperature datasets show very similar changes (Hartmann et al., 
         <a>2013</a>). All show an overall warming pattern robust to data uncertainty, but with clear
         phases of accelerated warming from 1900 to the 1940s and from the 1970s to 2000s,
         a stagnation from the 1940s to the 1970s, and a slowdown in warming from 2000 to about
         2013. A period of anomalously cold conditions at the beginning of the ETCW period
         is particularly pronounced in sea surface temperatures (Figure 
         <a>1</a>b). Estimates of the uncertainty in a single dataset are visible but not large (Morice
         et al., 
         <a>2012</a>; see Figure 
         <a>1</a>), and simulations that contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase
         5 (CMIP5)’s multi‐model ensemble reproduce many of the key observed features. Figure
         
         <a>1</a> compares climate models and observational data over the regions where observations
         are available, and uses a combination of SSTs over ocean and near‐surface air temperature
         over land in both models and data in order to reduce biases in model‐data comparisons
         (Cowtan &amp; Way, 
         <a>2014</a>). A truly global average of temperature would in addition be affected by missing
         data, particularly in the Arctic (Karl et al., 
         <a>2015</a>). Even fairly recently, an inhomogeneity of SST data, caused by changing contributions
         by different shipping fleets, has been detected and corrected (Kennedy et al., 
         <a>2011</a>), while other inhomogeneities are likely still present, which may lead to an overestimate
         of the unforced component of the ETCW (Chan &amp; Huybers, 
         <a>n.d.</a>). In addition, there are remaining biases in land temperature data, such as summer
         temperature biases preceding the widespread use of the Stevenson screen (Auchmann
         &amp; Brönnimann, 
         <a>2012</a>; Brunet et al., 
         <a>2011</a>) which may lead to an overestimation of summer temperatures prior to the second half
         of the 20th century. Processing techniques such as gridding methods are less important,
         since using different statistical approaches lead to very similar global mean temperatures
         (Rohde et al., 
         <a>2013</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Support for the large‐scale temperature record during the past 150 years comes from
         recently constructed, noninstrumental global temperature index based on proxies (Anderson
         et al., 
         <a>2013</a>; Crowley et al., 
         <a>2014</a>), and other proxy reconstructions of Northern Hemispheric temperatures that also
         show the early 20th century as a pronounced period of warming (see Figure 
         <a>1</a>c). Thus, although there may be remaining uncertainties on the exact temperature the
         ETCW started from, and peak temperatures during it, the early 20th century showed
         robust global warming.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial pattern of warming (Figure 
         <a>2</a>) is less well resolved in many regions of the world than the recent warming, with
         many key regions missing or only covered by sporadic measurements, for example, the
         tropical Pacific and much of the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the African interior,
         South America, and Asia (Figure 
         <a>2</a>). Nevertheless, many robust features emerge: in the HadCRUT4 annual and seasonal
         mean surface air temperature, the warming over the first four decades of the 20th
         century appears particularly prominent over high latitudes of Europe, the Atlantic
         and over the northern North Pacific and Canada (the warming from 1901 to 1951, used
         in the attribution analysis, is similar in pattern although with slightly less pronounced
         anomalies, Figure 
         <a>S1; Figure S2</a> for model fingerprints). Unusual early warmth in the Arctic occurred as early as
         1918, discussed further below. There is also a remarkably strong temperature trend
         over the Atlantic, peaking in the midlatitudes, near the equator and the far North,
         while parts of Eurasia are neutral or cooling. This trend is particularly pronounced
         in boreal summer. The ETCW pattern is distinctly different from the widespread warming
         pattern over the entire 20th century (Hartmann et al., 
         <a>2013</a>) in both the boreal cold and warm seasons. The latter strongly resembles the expected
         fingerprint of greenhouse warming with stronger warming over land than oceans, and
         enhancement in the Arctic (Bindoff et al., 
         <a>2013</a>; Brönnimann, 
         <a>2009</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Precipitation changes over the early 20th century are highly uncertain with only a
         limited amount of in situ data available over land (see Hegerl et al., 
         <a>2015</a>, and references therein) including some island stations that extend back into the
         early 20th century (Polson, Hegerl, &amp; Solomon, 
         <a>2016</a>). Figure 
         <a>S3</a> shows an estimate of precipitation trends for the 1901–1945 period for the boreal
         warm (April–September) and cool (October–March) precipitation seasons (Schneider et
         al., 
         <a>2014</a>). Despite high data uncertainty, some features are consistent with changes in precipitation
         that are expected with warming, namely increased precipitation in the region of the
         Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and in northern high latitudes but decreased
         precipitation in the outer tropics and parts of the subtropics.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ETCW was both a period of Arctic warming and Arctic sea ice retreat. This retreat
         is difficult to document, as early observational data are often infilled with climatology
         in regions without measurements, leading to a possible underestimation of sea ice
         retreat during this period. Recent reprocessing adding more ice chart data has made
         the early 20th century ice retreat more visible and well documented at least in some
         regions (Titchner, personal communication, 2017; Walsh, Fetterer, Stewart, &amp; Chapman,
         
         <a>2017</a>), but the limited availability of observations is still problematic (see Fig. 5 in
         Walsh et al., 
         <a>2017</a>). Figure 
         <a>3</a> illustrates a substantial reduction of the best‐sampled spring and early summer ice
         around 1940. Climate models tend to show much weaker sea ice reductions over the ETCW
         period (H. Titchner and D. Polson, personal communication, September 11, 2017), suggesting
         that, similar to the Arctic atmospheric warming, the observed retreat is driven at
         least in part by internal climate variability (Brönnimann et al., 
         <a>2012</a>; Wood &amp; Overland, 
         <a>2010</a>). This early sea ice retreat period is an important yardstick for the recent ice
         retreat and ice‐temperature relationships. Hence further processing of old charts
         and reducing the infilled parts of the sea ice record is vital.
