      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many aspects of the observed mean state of the atmosphere during the recent 2012–2016
         California drought are qualitatively consistent with our simulated response to Arctic
         sea-ice changes. ERA-Interim estimates of the precipitation, geopotential, and OLR
         anomalies between 2012 and 2015 (relative to the period 1979–2010) are shown in Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>7</a>. Similar to our simulations, ERA-Interim exhibits a geopotential ridge in the North
         Pacific and a precipitation decrease over California (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7a, b</a>). In the tropics, precipitation decreases across the central and eastern tropical
         Pacific and increases northward of this region and in the west tropical Pacific (Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>7a</a>). Another commonality is the behavior of OLR changes across the central tropical
         Pacific and over California (see Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7c</a>). The magnitudes of the observed 3-year mean anomalies during the recent California
         drought (Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>7a</a>) are much larger than the magnitudes of the 20-year mean response to sea-ice changes
         shown in Fig. 
         <a>2a</a>. This is expected given that the longer 20-year period contains both dry and wet
         years. As seen from Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>8a</a>, low Arctic sea-ice increases the likelihood of drier California, but does not result
         in drier conditions over California every single year. On average, when considering
         the 20-year mean, there is a 10–15% decrease in California’s rainfall (Fig. 
         <a>2c</a>). Comparison with the driest 3-year interval within this 20-year period (Supplementary
         Fig. 
         <a>8b</a>) indicates that the magnitude of the simulated precipitation response is comparable
         to the magnitude of changes in ERA-Interim during the most recent drought.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This consistency does not, however, constitute compelling evidence that the 2012–2016
         California drought is attributable to Arctic sea-ice changes. Rather, it illustrates
         that some of the atmospheric features of the droughts driven by Arctic sea-ice loss
         may resemble those of the most recent California drought. The intensification of dry
         conditions over California since late 2012 may have also been affected by several
         other factors not discussed in this study, such as the appearance of a large warm
         SST anomaly off the west coast of North America—though this appears to be a consequence
         rather than a cause of the altered atmospheric circulations causing the drought
         <span><a>41</a></span>. Another important factor may be the 2014 phase shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
         from negative to positive. However, this shift would be expected to alleviate drought
         conditions over California—not intensify them
         <span><a>42</a></span>. Finally, we note that other hemispherically asymmetric forcings may also trigger—via
         the same physical pathways described here—tropical convection changes and teleconnections
         affecting California’s precipitation. Possible examples include asymmetric forcing
         by anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic eruptions, and solar irradiance variations. All
         of these forcings can alter the inter-hemispheric temperature gradient
         <span><a>43</a></span>, thereby causing shifts in the location of tropical convection and initiating “far-field”
         precipitation changes over California.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is of interest to consider whether paleoclimatic evidence provides support for
         our model-inferred two-step teleconnection (Fig. 
         <a>4</a>). We focus on past periods with pronounced excursions in Arctic temperatures and
         sea-ice cover. The first part of the two-step teleconnection is well documented in
         both paleoclimate simulations and paleoclimate records of the last glacial period
         <span><a>44</a></span>. Abrupt high-latitude temperature increase during the last interglacial (the Dansgaard–Oeschger
         and Bølling–Allerød warmings) are manifest in the tropics through a northward shift
         in the position of the ITCZ
         <span><a>45</a>–
            <a>47</a></span>. Conversely, the signature of cold stadials and Younger Dryas cooling in the Arctic
         is matched by a southward shift of tropical precipitation across all ocean basins
         <span><a>45</a>–
            <a>48</a></span>. These ITCZ shifts are consistent with precipitation changes inferred from high-resolution,
         precisely dated speleothem records: speleothems across the southwestern United States
         indicate shifts to drier conditions during the Dansgaard–Oeschger warmings
         <span><a>49</a>, 
            <a>50</a></span>, the Bølling–Allerød warming, and the termination of the Younger Dryas cooling
         <span><a>51</a></span>. Similarly, during the Heinrich 1 and Younger Dryas cold periods, wetter conditions
         are indicated by lake-level high stands in the Great Basin and glaciation in central
         and southern California
         <span><a>52</a>, 
            <a>53</a></span>, while at least one modeling study has implicated North Atlantic cooling and a corresponding
         southward ITCZ shift as a possible cause of increased precipitation over the western
         United States
         <span><a>54</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing, magnitude, and drivers of sea-ice changes during the last millennium are
         less well understood
         <span><a>55</a></span>. In addition, volcanic activity may have also had an impact on tropical precipitation
         during this time
         <span><a>56</a></span>. However, proxy data for the last millennium does yield information regarding the
         second teleconnection step—the link between the ITCZ location and southwestern rainfall.
         The southward shift of the ITCZ in the transition from the medieval climate anomaly
         (MCA) to the little ice age (LIA) is well documented
         <span><a>57</a>, 
            <a>58</a></span>. The effect of this shift is apparent in the contrast between the dry MCA and the
         wet LIA in the western US lake levels
         <span><a>59</a></span>, from trees growing on lake beds exposed by low lake levels
         <span><a>60</a>, 
            <a>61</a></span>, and in pollen records
         <span><a>62</a></span>. Interestingly, a brief southward shift in the ITCZ position between ~AD 1050 and
         1250
         <span><a>57</a></span> is clearly recorded in the American southwest as a wet interval in the midst of the
         dry MCA. Great Basin lakes expanded briefly during this period
         <span><a>63</a>, 
            <a>64</a></span>, concurrent with drowning of trees growing below modern water levels
         <span><a>60</a>, 
            <a>61</a></span> and increased soil moisture in southern California (as inferred from pollen records)
         <span><a>62</a></span>. Such periods during the MCA and LIA provide some support for the second teleconnection
         step. In the absence of more reliable sea-ice data sets, however, we cannot confirm
         if such covariance relationships between the ITCZ location and southwestern rainfall
         are directly attributable to sea-ice changes, or could instead be due to other factors
         (e.g., volcanic forcing or solar irradiance changes).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we address the suitability of our experimental configuration (an AGCM coupled
         to a slab ocean) for studying the fast atmosphere–surface ocean-mediated response
         to sea-ice changes. In our simulations, key response features are manifest within
         the first two decades (see Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>9</a>). While our current study does not examine how this initial atmosphere–surface ocean
         response may be altered on longer timescales by the deep ocean, we note that the fast
         response identified here is in agreement with previous AOGCM-based studies
         <span><a>15</a>, 
            <a>29</a>, 
            <a>30</a></span>. Additional analysis of the short-term (first 50 years) response of an AOGCM response
         to sea-ice changes in a complementary, energy-conserving setup confirms our AGCM/slab
         ocean findings (see 
         <a>Supplementary Discussions</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
         <a>10</a>). The decadal-scale AOGCM response indicates tropical convection changes and drying
         over California in response to the loss of Arctic sea-ice cover, a qualitatively similar
         result to that seen in the present study. Recent studies have investigated the impacts
         of Arctic sea-ice loss in a fully coupled AOGCM setup by imposing artificial high-latitude
         energy fluxes
         <span><a>24</a>, 
            <a>25</a></span>. These studies have demonstrated the importance of ocean dynamics one century after
         imposing high-latitude longwave forcing. However, such investigations provide no evidence
         that ocean dynamics dominates the response to high-latitude longwave forcing on timescales
         considerably shorter than a century, nor do they indicate when the transition to an
         ocean-dominated response would occur. Understanding the differences between energy-conserving
         and non-energy-conserving setups, in particular how the presumed impacts of sea-ice
         changes in non-energy-conserving experimental setups
         <span><a>24</a>, 
            <a>25</a></span> may be affected by artificially imposed energy flux perturbations remains an important
         future step. A key result from our study is the identification of a link between high-latitude
         and tropical energy budget and convection changes that can further drive precipitation
         changes over California. This link highlights the importance of differentiating between:
         (i) the different timescales of the response; and (ii) studies that attempt to isolate
         the impacts of sea-ice changes by imposing large artificial energy perturbations in
         order to achieve the sea-ice loss
         <span><a>24</a>, 
            <a>25</a></span>, and investigations that achieve sea-ice changes in an energy-conserving manner (ref.
         
         <span><a>30</a></span> and the current study).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selection, implementation, and testing of sea-ice physics parameter changes from the
         latin hypercube simulation ensemble
         <span><a>20</a></span> has provided a novel energy-conserving framework for testing the climate impacts
         of sea-ice changes. Our results implicate both Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice loss as
         potential drivers of future precipitation changes over the American southwest. We
         show that substantial loss of high-latitude sea-ice cover is likely to have significant
         far-field effects, and can impact California’s precipitation through atmospheric teleconnections
         involving tropical convection changes.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present day precipitation decreases over California and the associated circulation
         anomalies are not evident in coupled model projections of twenty-first century climate
         <span><a>65</a></span>. Most current simulations disagree regarding the sign of the future precipitation
         changes over California
         <span><a>65</a></span>. As a consequence, a multi-model mean features a large envelope of uncertainty, and
         suggests negligible precipitation decline in the first decade of the twenty-first
         century, followed by an increase in precipitation
         <span><a>8</a>, 
            <a>65</a></span> over the next decade. One possible cause of these inter-model discrepancies is that
         some climate models underestimate the magnitude of observed Arctic sea-ice loss over
         the satellite era
         <span><a>19</a></span> and the sign of recent Antarctic sea-ice changes
         <span><a>66</a>, 
            <a>67</a></span>. Our analysis suggests that both of these factors—the reduced magnitude of Arctic
         sea-ice loss and the reversed sign of Antarctic sea-ice changes relative to the observations—contribute
         to the smaller than observed precipitation decline in model simulations of early twenty-first
         century climate change. Our results imply that as long as Arctic sea-ice cover continues
         to decrease, overall sea-ice forcing will favor drying over California. This assumes
         that Antarctic sea-ice continues to expand or remains stationary over the next several
         decades. As Antarctic sea-ice cover begins to decrease, the competing influences of
         Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice loss will weaken or even reverse the sign of the sea-ice
         driven component of California’s precipitation changes. We emphasize, however, that
         sea-ice loss is one of multiple factors implicated in driving the described atmospheric
         circulation and precipitation changes. In simulations of historical and future climate,
         multiple hemispherically asymmetric forcings are changing simultaneously. Some of
         these forcings affect sea-ice cover, thus hampering the elucidation of links between
         Arctic sea-ice loss and California’s rainfall. This is one advantage of the experimental
         configuration used here. By design, the convection, atmospheric circulation, and precipitation
         responses described here are directly related to sea-ice changes in each hemisphere,
         and not to changes in anthropogenic and natural forcings, or deep-ocean feedbacks.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have confirmed that the short-term (decadal-scale) response to Arctic sea-ice loss
         described in our study is consistent with the response found in previous AOGCM studies
         that allow for ocean dynamics and deep-ocean changes. The long-term centennial climate
         response to sea-ice changes may, however, differ from the fast response described
         here. While investigations with other climate models are necessary to further confirm
         these findings, our results strongly suggest that what happens in the Arctic does
         not stay in the Arctic and provide a physically plausible pathway by which high-latitude
         sea-ice forcing may mediate tropical climate, and thereby influence California’s rainfall.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a final remark, we note that the pronounced Arctic sea-ice loss over the satellite
         era is likely human-induced, arising from anthropogenic warming caused by greenhouse
         gas increases
         <span><a>68</a></span>. Our study thus identifies yet another pathway by which human activities could affect
         the occurrence of future droughts over California—through human-induced Arctic sea-ice
         decline.
