            <a>1</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a> illustrate some of the differences in Arctic sea-ice cover between control and “low
            Arctic ice” simulations. During August and September, monthly mean Arctic sea-ice
            area for the “low Arctic ice” ensemble mean falls below the 1 million km
            <span>2</span> threshold used to define a nearly ice-free Arctic
            <span><a>19</a></span>. By comparison, CMIP-5 simulations of twenty-first century climate and extrapolations
            of observed changes in ice volume place the time horizon for a nearly ice-free Arctic
            roughly between 2020 and 2040
            <span><a>19</a></span>. The smallest and largest differences between the “low Arctic ice” and control Arctic
            sea-ice area (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1</a>) occur in March and September, respectively, in accord with the seasonality of the
            observed Arctic sea-ice loss since the beginning of the satellite era.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the temperature impacts of sea-ice loss are most pronounced in the northern
            high- to mid-latitudes (Fig. 
            <a>2a</a>), precipitation anomalies show a more global response (Fig. 
            <a>2b, c</a>). We focus our analysis on the December–February season, because these months yield
            the largest impact of sea-ice changes on Californian precipitation in our model simulations.
            The most striking feature of the precipitation response to Arctic sea-ice loss is
            the reorganization of tropical rainfall and an apparent northward precipitation shift.
            The Arctic sea-ice decline also results in significantly less precipitation over California—a
            consequence of a geopotential ridge in the North Pacific that steers the wet winter
            air masses northward into Alaska and Canada, away from California (Fig. 
            <a>2e</a>).

            Pacific shown in Fig. 
            <a>2e</a> is not just a direct consequence of sea-ice-induced surface warming and associated
            high-latitude planetary wave perturbations (as hypothesized previously), but rather
            is forced by sea-ice-induced convection changes over the tropical Pacific. We find
            that the key components of this two-step teleconnection are changes in the location
            and intensity of tropical Pacific convection and the northward-propagating Rossby
            wavetrain they initiate.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the first step of this teleconnection, sea-ice loss alters the high-latitude energy
            budget (see annual mean flux changes shown in Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>2</a> and 
            <a>3a</a>). These high-latitude energy flux changes are dominated by a decrease in the net
            top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation to space (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>2a</a>). Sea-ice loss leads to an increase in the net downward TOA shortwave flux (Supplementary
            Fig. 
            <a>2b</a>) that is only partly compensated by an increase in net TOA upward longwave flux.
            This yields an increased net TOA heat flux into the atmosphere, and thus less radiation
            to space. Over the high northern latitudes, the TOA net flux changes are on average
            larger than the net surface flux changes (Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>2a, c</a> and 
            <a>3a</a>), leading to an increased heat flux into the atmospheric column (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>). With the exception of very high northern latitudes, sea-ice induced decrease in
            the net upward shortwave flux at the surface is largely compensated by an increase
            in the latent and sensible heat fluxes (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>2e, f, g</a>). Several previous studies
            <span><a>30</a>, 
               <a>31</a></span> support our finding of larger high-latitude TOA flux anomalies (relative to surface
            flux anomalies) in response to sea-ice changes. Experimental configurations that impose
            artificial surface energy fluxes in order to remove sea-ice cover necessarily yield
            a substantially larger surface energy imbalance than the one described here.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of the increased high-latitude heat flux into the atmospheric column,
            the atmospheric heat transport from mid-latitudes into the high northern latitudes
            decreases (see the large white arrow in Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>). The high-latitude energy surplus is compensated for at lower latitudes, with most
            of the energy emitted to space through the TOA flux changes over the tropical Pacific
            between 20
            <span>°</span>S and 20
            <span>°</span>N (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3a, b</a>). Increase in the tropical net TOA flux to space is associated with changes in high
            cloud cover. As seen from Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>, regions of increased TOA flux to space coincide with the regions of decreased high
            cloud cover. An increase in the net TOA flux to space over the regions of decreased
            high cloud cover is a consequence of an increase in the outgoing longwave radiation
            (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>3c</a>) due to decreased radiation height, that is only partially compensated by an increase
            in the net downward shortwave flux.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical compensation of high-latitude energy budget perturbations has been noted
            in other studies employing AGCMs coupled to a slab ocean model
            <span><a>21</a>, 
               <a>23</a></span>. Such compensation is also evident in the short-term response to sea-ice changes
            in simulations employing fully coupled AOGCMs
            <span><a>30</a></span>. Specifically, previous work suggests that reorganization of atmospheric convection
            over the tropical Pacific (and resulting adjustment of the amount of energy emitted
            to space) can provide a compensation for energy budget perturbations elsewhere
            <span><a>21</a>, 
               <a>23</a></span>. This is not dissimilar to the observed changes in tropical TOA fluxes during ENSO-related
            convection changes that are also capable of affecting the global energy budget
            <span><a>32</a></span>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mechanism by which high-latitude changes propagate into the tropics and induce
            tropical convection responses involves two processes: (i) a southward advection of
            the initial high-latitude temperature perturbation over the mid-latitudes through
            transport and mixing; and (ii) a wind/evaporation/sea-surface temperature feedback
            in the region of the northeasterly trades. The tropical response to high-latitude
            sea-ice loss in our model simulations is consistent with these findings (see Supplementary
            Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Once advected into the mid-latitudes, the sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies
            propagate into the tropics by giving rise to anomalous meridional surface pressure
            gradients that in turn affect the strengths of easterly winds. These wind strength
            changes then further drive the evaporative flux changes
            <span><a>21</a>-
               <a>23</a></span>. Specifically, over the northern tropics, in the region of the northeasterly trades,
            the progression of cold (warm) SST anomalies will lead to an increase (decrease) in
            the surface wind strengths. This results in increased (decreased) evaporative cooling,
            thus allowing for further propagation of cold (warm) anomalies toward the equator.
            Over the southern tropics, the response is the opposite, due to the background southeasterly
            flow. Negative (positive) wind strength and latent heat flux anomalies over the northern
            (southern) tropics in response to Arctic sea-ice loss are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4b, c</a>.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The progression of these relatively small SST changes into the tropics, in combination
            with tropospheric temperature changes aloft, can drive convection changes in the tropical
            Pacific
            <span><a>21</a>-
               <a>23</a></span>. Areas of large zonal and meridional temperature gradients adjacent to deep convection
            regions in the tropical Pacific represent so called “convective margins”
            <span><a>23</a>, 
               <a>33</a>, 
               <a>34</a></span>. These are areas where small changes in atmospheric conditions can initiate or halt
            deep convection. Even weak sea-surface temperature anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4a</a>), in combination with small tropospheric temperature changes (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4d</a>), are sufficient to trigger convection changes over these regions (Fig.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We suggest that the tropical Pacific convection changes described above play a key
            role in driving the North Pacific circulation changes. Linkages between the equatorial
            Pacific convection anomalies and extratropical (North Pacific) atmospheric circulation
            changes are found in both observational and modeling studies
            <span><a>13</a>, 
               <a>35</a>, 
               <a>36</a></span> and have been invoked to explain North Pacific circulation differences during different
            phases of the ENSO cycle. These studies find that enhanced winter convection (and
            corresponding enhanced upper-level divergence) in the equatorial Pacific initiates
            a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain. The characteristics of this wavetrain are
            positive stream function and geopotential anomalies immediately outside the region
            of increased convection (anticyclonic flow), and negative anomalies in the extratropical
            Pacific (cyclonic flow). We find that this mechanism also operates in our simulations.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the DJF season, the area of strongest decrease in high cloud cover is located
            over the central tropical Pacific (see contour lines in Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>). This region of decreased tropical deep convection coincides with the area of the
            largest outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) increase (see shading in Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>). In the second teleconnection step, decreased deep convection in the tropical Pacific
            (Fig. 
            <a>2d</a>) and the associated decrease in upper-level divergence force a northward-propagating
            Rossby wavetrain with negative (cyclonic) anomalies in the northern tropical Pacific
            and positive (anticyclonic) anomalies in the extratropical North Pacific sector. This
            is evident from the 250 mb stream function changes (Fig. 
            <a>2f</a>), which indicate anomalous cyclonic flow in the tropics and anomalous anticyclonic
            flow in the North Pacific. The 250 mb North Pacific anticyclonic flow is the upper-level
            manifestation of the geopotential ridge in Fig. 
            <a>2e</a>—a factor responsible for steering the wet winter air masses away from California.
            The atmospheric anomalies in the North Pacific exhibit an equivalent barotropic response
            (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5a</a>).
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The convection changes described above are consistent with the simulated upper-level
            vertical velocity anomalies and Hadley circulation changes. From a climatological
            perspective, the descending branch of the winter Hadley cell is positioned over (and
            to the west of) California (Fig. 
            <a>3a</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). Arctic sea-ice loss markedly amplifies this subsidence over California, while also
            affecting the uplift and subsidence regions across the tropical Pacific (Fig.

            <a>4</a> summarizes the hypothesized two-step teleconnection, involving sea-ice loss, tropical
            convection reorganization, a northward-propagating Rossby wavetrain, and a decrease
            in precipitation over California. Several previous studies have suggested that tropical
            and subtropical Pacific convection changes affect precipitation over California by
            inducing geopotential anomalies in the North Pacific

            natural variability, our analysis indicates that they can also be forced from the
            high latitudes by substantial sea-ice loss. Our simulations imply that two hitherto
            separate hypotheses—that Californian rainfall is primarily influenced by tropical
            convection changes (“tropical hypothesis”)

            changes require understanding complex atmospheric teleconnections that can propagate
            back and forth between the extratropics and the tropics.

            Antarctic sea-ice loss. Antarctic sea-ice decline will result in a warming at mid-
            to high latitudes of the southern hemisphere. One consequence of this warming is a
            southward shift of tropical precipitation, with convection increase in the southern
            and central tropical Pacific
            <span><a>40</a></span>. This is the opposite to the precipitation response accompanying Arctic sea-ice loss.
            In accord with previous studies
            <span><a>13</a>, 
               <a>35</a>, 
               <a>36</a></span> and the mechanism advanced here, increased convection should in turn drive a northward-propagating
            Rossby wavetrain consisting of an anticyclonic anomaly in the tropical Pacific and
            a cyclonic anomaly in the North Pacific. This cyclonic flow is associated with negative
            geopotential height anomalies over the North Pacific (geopotential low) leading to
            wetter conditions over California. Simulations in which the sea-ice physics parameter
            perturbations are prescribed in the Southern hemisphere only (“low Antarctic ice”
            simulations, Fig. 
            <a>1b</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>1b, d</a>) show a response that is consistent with these expectations. Tropical precipitation
            shifts southward (Fig. 
            <a>5a</a>), anticyclonic flow is established over the northern tropical Pacific, and cyclonic
            flow is formed over the North Pacific (Fig. 
            <a>5c</a>). The geopotential ridge in the North Pacific is replaced with a geopotential trough,
            favoring the propagation of tropical storms across California (Fig. 
            <a>5b</a>). As a result, precipitation over California increases (Fig. 
            <a>5a</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “low Antarctic ice” simulations show that the proposed mechanism can be triggered
            by sea-ice changes in either hemisphere. Since Antarctic sea-ice loss involves northward
            propagation in both teleconnection steps (i.e., Antarctic sea-ice affecting the tropical
            Pacific, which in turn affects the North Pacific) and no high northern latitude changes,
            it provides additional support for our conjecture that the sea-ice changes can influence
            North Pacific geopotential height through tropical convection changes. More generally,
            any high-latitude perturbation (northern or southern hemispheric warming or cooling)
            that impacts the position of the tropical Pacific ITCZ, will have an impact on California’s
            rainfall.
