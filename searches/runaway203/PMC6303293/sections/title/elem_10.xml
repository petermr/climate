  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total climate trends in the individual model realizations would results from the superposition of external natural forcings, internal climate variability and the anthropogenic external forcing (Equation 
   <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>). Using the CESM1, we can separate out the external forcings and the internal climatic variability; however, it is extremely difficult to quantify the relative contribution of the individual external forcing factors influencing the total trend.
  </p>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, to examine the contribution of the individual forcings we have used the CCSM4 single forcing simulations, separately for all forcings, land only, GHG only, aerosol only, ozone only, solar only and volcano only forcings. More details about the model experiments, number of runs, etc. are available in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The long-term trend in the SAT from the model outputs is analyzed so that the natural and anthropogenic signals in simulated SAT anomaly timeseries (w.r.t. 1971–2000) over India from 1961 to 2000 can be detected during the summer monsoon months (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8</a>). Results show that the anthropogenic forcing factors such as GHG and aerosols can significantly affect the SAT trend over the HSTC zone (particularly the IGP region). Due to GHG only forcing (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>), a warming trend (~2.4 °C/40 yrs) predominates along the IGP region, stretching between 15–35°N and 65–90°E. However, the cooling trend due to rapid increase in aerosol loading (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>) and the ozone only forcing (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8c</a>) can mask the warming effect of GHG to some extent. Despite, the negative contribution of aerosol and ozone, an overall warming trend predominates over this region due to anthropogenic only forcing. The land only forcing (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8f</a>) has weak contribution to the SAT trend in the HSTC region; however, weak cooling trend in the western and southern peninsular region of India is predominant. In external natural forcing category, the solar only (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8d</a>) and the volcanic only (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8h</a>) forcings contributes contrastingly, with strong warming trend (&gt;2.4 °C/40 yrs) and weak cooling trend, over the IGP region, respectively. Therefore, both the anthropogenic only and external natural only forcings have mixed response to the total SAT trend over the Indian region.

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further investigate the relative contribution of each of the external forcing factors, we plotted the time series of area mean (15–35°N and 65–90°E) SAT anomalies for all the single forcing runs, which are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>. An 11 years running mean smoothing filter is applied on each of the time series, to remove the inter-annual variability and to highlight the multidecadal variability in the trends. The GHG only and solar only forcings exhibit a stronger warming trends (maximum value reaches 0.55 °C and 0.2 °C, respectively), whereas, the land only, aerosol only, volcano only and ozone only forcing displays cooling trend and the minimum value reaches ~ −0.25 °C, −0.1 °C, −0.2 °C and −0.15 °C, respectively in the recent few decades. Additionally, the internal climatic variability (from CESM1.1 analysis) contribute significantly to the cooling, resulting an overall cooling trend in the HSTC region. We then quantify the relative contribution of individual forcing factors i.e. aerosol, ozone, volcano only forcings and internal variability driving the cooling trend over the HSTC region using Equation 
   <a rid="Equ6" ref-type="" href="#Equ6">6</a>. The internal variability contributes maximum, which can explain approximately 72% of the temperature variability over that region, whereas, aerosol, ozone and volcano only forcings contribute ~10%, 8.9% and 8%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>).

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worthy to mention that a wide range of uncertainties are involved in climate model simulations in terms of different forcings factors, particularly the aerosol forcing contributes largely to the uncertainties. Lu 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span> show that the residential sector contributes the most to overall emission uncertainties in India (60–65% for Black Carbon and 67–74% for Organic Carbon). In CCSM4 single forcings simulations, the uncertainties in aerosol only simulations are approximately 35%, which may result from black carbon and/or sulphate aerosols. Since CCSM4 model have 1 simulation both for sulphate and black carbon only forcing, we cannot quantify their contributions to the uncertainties involved in net aerosols forcings.
