 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spatial differences between the TOA ERF due to GHGs and that due to aerosols, however, are further homogenized in the surface energy flux perturbation due to each, achieving approximately two-thirds of the spatial similarity seen by Xie et al.

  </span> in the eventual sea surface temperature (SST) response. The pattern of surface energy flux perturbation (Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span>, defined as the change in total surface energy flux, composed of radiative shortwave and longwave, latent, and sensible energy) in response to the two forcers is more strongly anti-correlated (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.52) than the TOA ERF, indicating an additional process of homogenization between the TOA perturbation and the surface perturbation. Because the surface energy balance over land rapidly re-equilibrates due to the low effective heat capacity of the land surface, Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> is near zero for all land surfaces by necessity. The spatial correlation of Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> is therefore calculated only over the ocean, although the values are similar with and without land-masking. The oceanic surface energy balance is not constrained to re-equilibrate on atmosphere-only timescales, and as such will reflect the atmospheric conditions setting surface fluxes.

 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> can be construed as an intermediary between the TOA atmospheric perturbation of a forcing agent and the ocean response thereto, and is thus a telling manifestation of the fast, atmosphere-and-land-only pathway for fully atmosphere-and-ocean coupled response pattern formation. The annual-mean, global-mean Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> correlation between GHGs and aerosols emerges most strongly in the surface sensible heat flux component of the surface energy balance (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). In contrast, the surface radiative (shortwave and longwave) flux change is little correlated (
  <span class="italic">R</span> = −0.13*), indicating that neither the radiative effects of climatological cloud masking nor of cloud change are responsible for the spatial similarities in Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span>. The strongest anti-correlation occurs largely during Northern Hemisphere summertime over the tropical and northern extratropical oceans, as indicated by the seasonal and latitudinal decomposition of Δ
  <span class="italic">S</span> (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>), and is driven by antisymmetric wave-like patterns in the surface latent and sensible heat flux change in response to each forcer (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c, d</a>).
