      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observational temperature time-series are taken from a spatially in-filled version
         of the Met Office Hadley Centre HadCRUT4 dataset [
         <a>20</a>] (which we refer to as HadCRUT4-CW). This 100 member ensemble of hybrid air/sea temperatures
         uses a statistical technique to in-fill unobserved regions in the original HadCRUT4
         product [
         <a>21</a>] so as to achieve complete global coverage and enable a like-for-like comparison
         with global ESM output [
         <a>22</a>]. Observational data are used at annual time resolution up until the end of 2016.
         The HadCRUT4-CW ensemble allows for a systematic sampling of observational uncertainty;
         however, methodological choices between different observational product represent
         another source of uncertainty. As a sensitivity test, we also conduct analysis using
         the best-estimate warming from the Berkeley Earth dataset [
         <a>23</a>], which shows higher warming over the historical period (see the electronic supplementary
         material).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observed cumulative emission estimates are taken from the 2016 Global Carbon Project
         (GCP) dataset [
         <a>24</a>]. Observational uncertainties are accounted for using an ensemble created by independent
         sampling of uncertainties in fossil fuel and industry emissions, and land-use emissions
         as described in [
         <a>24</a>]. We also conduct sensitivity analysis using the 2017 GCP dataset [
         <a>25</a>], which indicates substantially higher historical land-use change emissions (see
         the electronic supplementary material).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A history of effective radiative forcing (ERF), and its uncertainty, is required to
         estimate the fraction of observed warming associated with both human activities and
         that associated specifically with CO
         <sub>2</sub> emissions only. Best-estimate time-series of historical ERF for the individual components
         of anthropogenic and natural radiative forcing (e.g. CO
         <sub>2</sub>, other well-mixed GHGs, aerosols and volcanic) are taken from Myhre 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>26</a>] and have been extended using observational data up to the end of 2016 as in [
         <a>27</a>]. The central estimate of ERF from non-CO
         <sub>2</sub> GHGs has been updated to incorporate a recent upward revision to the methane radiative
         forcing proposed in [
         <a>28</a>]. Volcanic forcing for the recent period is taken from Andersson 
         <span>et al.</span> [
         <a>29</a>], and solar forcing using data from Kopp [
         <a>30</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical ERF uncertainty is sampled by multiplying the best-estimate forcing time-series
         for a given component of ERF by draws from a distribution of the fractional uncertainty
         in that component's 2011 forcing, as assessed in IPCC-AR5 [
         <a>26</a>]. Individual forcing components are sampled independently and then combined to create
         a distribution of uncertainty in total historical ERF on the climate system (see electronic
         supplementary material, figure S1).
