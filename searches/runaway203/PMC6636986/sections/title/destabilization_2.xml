 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) Grounding line and calving front of present-day observed state (green contours) and evolution of grounding line position during self-sustained retreat (colored contours, 750-year time steps), underlaid by bed topography (blue shading). The mass addition region used in the perturbation simulations is highlighted by the white sector, within which mass deposition is restricted to ice sheet areas that have been grounded at the onset of the perturbation. Insets show the state of the Antarctic Ice Sheet as observed (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) and after simulated collapse of the WAIS (
  <span class="bold">C</span>). Hatched area refers to the region outside the model domain, and blue rectangle indicates region shown in (A).
