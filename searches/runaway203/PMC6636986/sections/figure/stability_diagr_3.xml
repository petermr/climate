   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <sub>c</sub> (white curve) of stabilization is approximated by function given at the top right corner. The approximated threshold is transferred into phase space of (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) total amount 
   <span class="italic">M</span> versus duration of mass addition, and (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) total amount versus rate of mass addition. White stars highlight simulations that share the same total amount of deposited mass (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 8000 Gt), added at differing rate and duration, showing that the combination of both determines potential stabilization.
