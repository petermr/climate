 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate and ecosystems usually respond rather linearly to changes in external conditions. However, there are also occasions when at some point a sudden and large shift to a very different state occurs. An important cause of such behavior can be a positive feedback which leads to a self-amplifying change, making the system very sensitive to external conditions. Such feedback-induced threshold behavior is often referred to as a tipping point
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. If the feedback is very strong, alternative stable states can exist under the same external conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). In models, the parameter values at which the system’s dynamics suddenly changes are called bifurcation points. For example, when the system is driven over a bifurcation point where a current equilibrium ceases to exist, an abrupt and irreversible shift toward a different equilibrium can occur. Tipping points and alternative states exist in many simple models, for example representing ocean circulation

  <span class="sup">

 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the conventional illustration of a tipping point it is assumed that the driver (representing external conditions), varies monotonically and gradually, so that the system stays close to a stable equilibrium (black curve in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1a</a>). However, many environmental conditions change so rapidly that the system’s state cannot catch up with the changing equilibrium. For example, global warming can drive the Greenland ice sheet into a regime where it is not sustainable anymore
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. However, the ice sheet can take millennia to melt completely, which gives us a window of “borrowed time”
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span> in which we could save the ice-sheet should the temperature decrease again in time
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span>. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> illustrates the two possibilities of a saved (blue) and a collapsing system (red). As the excursion beyond the threshold takes more time for the red trajectory, the system shifts to the realm of the lower stable branch, while the blue trajectory returns toward its old state.

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As natural systems are permanently exposed to environmental change, they are usually not in equilibrium. The external fluctuations that drive them are usually simplified as stochastic, but in reality there often is a dominant timescale as well. This is particularly obvious if the change in external conditions consists in a periodic oscillation, for example the very regular annual and diurnal cycles of solar insolation, and the quasi-periodic changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters. Also, the climate system’s internal variability shows modes with specific frequency ranges, most importantly the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
  <span class="sup">

  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such oscillations will affect parts of the climate system or ecosystems that have intrinsic thresholds or bifurcations: a gradual change in the mean, amplitude or frequency of periodic drivers can trigger abrupt change in these systems. In the following, we first illustrate these phenomena with a simple mathematical system. Subsequently, we point out how models and observations indicate the existence of these phenomena in many elements of the Earth system, spanning a vast range of time scales. We illustrate some consequences of this view for monsoon systems, sea ice and terrestrial ecosystems, and argue how a general view on tipping points can contribute to a conceptual understanding of different tipping elements in the Earth system.</p>
