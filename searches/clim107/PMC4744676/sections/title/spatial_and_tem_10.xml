 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spatial and temporal patterns of ocean change studies</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our review revealed several geographic biases, both general and discipline specific, in distributions of highly cited ocean change studies. However, a lack of demonstrated climate change impacts within a region does not necessarily mean impacts are absent (Hansen &amp; Cramer, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0030">2015</a>). Many of these geographically based disparities are to be expected given accessibility, the predominance of scientists in northern countries, and the area covered by each taxonomic group. Some taxa and systems are limited by their biogeographic distribution (e.g., tropical coral reefs) or associations with localized physical phenomena (e.g., polar bears, 
  <span class="italic">Ursus marinus</span>, associated with Arctic sea ice). For example, the Arctic is home to some of the most rapidly and drastically transforming marine ecosystems on the planet (e.g., Serreze 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0085">2007</a>; Grebmeier, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0028">2012</a>), as reflected by the relatively high number of Arctic ocean change studies. However, research on Arctic biological responses remains primarily limited to vertebrate studies largely focused on polar bears, ice‐associated seals, and a few marine bird species. Studies on benthic communities were notably absent from the highly cited Arctic studies. Wassmann 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0090" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0090">2011</a>) found similar biases toward biological response studies focused on vertebrates in the Arctic and argued for increased effort at lower trophic levels. Some physical parameters also have geographic limits. For example, monitoring of sea ice extent is geographically restricted to the poles, which contributed the majority of the physical measurements in polar regions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We show observation biases concerning the regions where highly cited ocean change research is conducted and how this varies among disciplines. In particular, Southern Hemisphere ocean basins (e.g., the South Atlantic and Pacific, Indian, and Southern Ocean) were characterized by a general lack of ocean change research, especially relative to their large proportional surface area of the global ocean. Human development (which “remains a composite index that measures progress in three basic dimensions – health, knowledge and income”, 2014 UN Human Development Reports: 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries</span>) and technological capacity are highest in Western Europe, North America, and Australia and may partially explain geographic biases of greater research focus (by nearly 3×) in the Northern Hemisphere. Greater human development in Australia and parts of South America (e.g., Chile) may contribute to the relatively high prevalence of benthic studies, focused on coral reefs and kelp forests, in the South Pacific. Additionally, we focused on the most frequently cited papers, which may impose geographic biases due to citation patterns. There may be higher citation potential in areas where there are more researchers, such as the North Atlantic or Mediterranean. However, similar geographic biases have been described elsewhere in the biological impacts literature, such as the predominance of biological change studies in more temperate (Wernberg 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0091">2012</a>) and Northern Hemisphere (Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>) waters, especially the northeast Atlantic basin (Hoegh‐Guldberg 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0039">2014</a>). Lenoir &amp; Svenning (
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0050">2015</a>) note that a geographic bias in the Northern Hemisphere was not as prominent in a review of the marine compared to terrestrial range shift literature. Our study highlights finer regional and thematic biases than previous studies and also offers direct comparisons between studies with abiotic and biological focus. For example, we show that the proportion of studies from each discipline was more similar in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific basins than other regions. The more representative coverage among disciplines, in addition to an overall greater geographic focus, suggests that studies in the North Atlantic and Pacific basin may have more power for ecosystem‐wide or cross‐disciplinary investigations than elsewhere.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to basin‐specific patterns, we found that approximately 20% of the highly cited ocean change studies were multiregional or global in scale, providing the potential for a more representative view of ocean change (Parmesan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0067">2011</a>). However, we also observed a trade‐off between geographic scale and sampling resolution (data not shown) for a number of studies in this review. Smaller‐scale environmental studies (&lt;10 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) often had increased sampling frequency (hourly–weekly) compared to studies that covered a greater geographic extent (greater than monthly or discrete sampling). Hence, while more localized studies may not be able to extrapolate findings to the basin or global scale (appropriate for ecosystem‐wide assessments), they may be better suited to estimate rates of change on more localized scales (e.g., discrete populations). There is also the potential for citation biases for large‐scale studies, where such studies may be cited more frequently due to their broad geographic representation and therefore more represented in our analyses. Indeed, multiregional and global papers had a mean number of 149.4 citations compared to 82.2 citations for all other smaller‐scale papers included in this review. The potential citation bias associated with large‐scale papers may be explained by uncritical or superficial citations (Banobi 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0002">2011</a>) when used in introductory sentences rather than more substantive citations used to augment interpretations and discussion of research findings.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies covering physical/chemical signals of ocean change were typically the longest running and covered the largest study areas. A relatively small number of biological ocean change studies were conducted on similarly broad scales. The emerging field of ocean acidification (examining a suite of changes in OA including pH, aragonite saturation, and pCO
  <sub>2</sub>) was often conducted on smaller scales and had a much shorter temporal record (median = 10.5 year) relative to other physical/chemical studies with median durations ranging from 2× (sea ice) to nearly 5× (SST) longer. Physical records like SST, sea level height, and sea ice are largely drawn from worldwide networks of autonomous sensors (e.g., Argo floats), interpolation of data from cruises, or derived from satellite measurements over particular geographic regions (global oceans in the former and polar regions in the latter). Such approaches allow data to be collected across wide areas and over extended durations. Long‐term physical and chemical records are essential to understanding climate variability, especially when detecting and attributing biological responses to climate change (Hoegh‐Guldberg 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0039">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies conducted over shorter time periods or lacking historical baselines have limited statistical power to demonstrate conclusively impacts due to climate (Edwards 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0023">2010</a>; Brown 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0004">2011</a>). Therefore, physical records, particularly the long duration and large spatial scale records for SST and sea level height, may ultimately have more statistical power to detect when a climate‐driven change has occurred. However, relating biological responses to physical changes is often complicated by mismatches in scale, sampling frequencies, or proximity of samples. The problem of pattern and scale (Levin, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0052">1992</a>) is thus a key issue in attributing observed biological changes to climate (Rosenzweig 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0083">2008</a>). Biological responses are measured at local, regional, and global scales relative to an assortment of climate measures (Garcia 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0026">2014</a>), and confidence in the assessment of climate impacts on marine taxa is greatest for long‐term studies with fine‐resolution data (O'Connor 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0063">2015</a>) or those conducted on the scale of entire ocean basins or greater (Parmesan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0067">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Life‐history characteristics of biological taxa also complicate a straightforward interpretation of differences in scale among disciplines. Climate responses are species specific (Poloczanska 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0071">2013</a>; Pörtner 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0073">2014</a>), and standardizing for the dispersal abilities and productivity of a given organism could provide a more comprehensive understanding of whether biological studies are conducted at scales and sampling frequencies necessary to assess change adequately. For example, marine mammal studies tended to incorporate relatively large spatial scales, but many of these species migrate over vast areas. Thus, sampling a single or relatively large study area may still only investigate a small portion of their overall home range, ultimately leading to an inadequate estimation of changes like shifts in distribution (Przeslawski 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0074">2012</a>). Similarly, long study durations, such as those for coral reefs, may still be inadequate for species that have extended generation times (e.g., ~100 year for 
  <span class="italic">Porites</span> spp.; Veron, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0088">1985</a>). On the other hand, plankton, that often have short generation times of days to months and limited motility, may actually be some of the best sampled marine organisms with respect to understanding baselines of population dynamics that are needed in assessing natural variability (on daily, seasonal, and interannual timescales) from climate‐mediated change. The number of generations studied ultimately may be a more relevant metric for biological responses than study duration and useful for standardization when comparing among species. For example, a zooplankton (e.g., calanoid copepod) study with a 1‐ to 2‐year duration, examining 1–10 generations, may be more comparable to a 10‐ to 15‐year study of marine mammals (e.g., phocid seals) that surveys one generation. While noting information on generation time and home range size may not be available for each species or population examined, we suggest a different impression of how completely taxonomic groups are sampled (in terms of scale and frequency) may emerge if standardization for home ranges and generation times were available for organisms studied in these ocean change studies. For example, the literature examining species range shifts in terrestrial systems uses km/decade as a common metric to compare responses among taxa, which have recently been applied to marine taxa (e.g., Pinsky 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0070">2013</a>) and is a standardization that has historically been lacking for marine climate impact studies (Richardson &amp; Poloczanska, 
  <a rid="gcb12978-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb12978-bib-0079">2008</a>).
