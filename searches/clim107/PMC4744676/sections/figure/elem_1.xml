 <div class="caption">
  <p>Spatial and temporal scales of investigation among highly cited ocean change studies. The scatter plot (a) shows all spatial and temporal data points (excluding laboratory studies) for the biological (circles) subdisciplines and physical/chemical (triangles) discipline. Both axes are plotted on a log scale. The asterisks on the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>‐ and 
   <span class="italic">y</span>‐axis represent the medians for temporal and spatial scales, respectively, for each subdiscipline (associated by color). See Table 
   <a rid="gcb12978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" href="#gcb12978-tbl-0002">2</a> for sample sizes corresponding to each subdiscipline. The median study area (b, top) and duration (b, bottom) for the ‘small‐scale’ and ‘large‐scale’ clusters as designated by the two‐step cluster analysis. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals.
