 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predicted trends from 2006 to 2100 in the eight variables used here are plotted in Fig. S1. As expected, pH decreases and SST increases throughout the world's oceans. The Arctic experiences the most rapid decrease in pH due to the retreat of sea ice which increases absorption of atmospheric CO

Strongest warming trends occur in the Northwest Pacific and in the tropics, with slower warming in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, coinciding with regions of deep water formation. Thermocline oxygen content declines almost everywhere due to warming‐related decreases in the solubility of gases and reduced ventilation. The exception is in the equatorial regions which are currently low oxygen zones. Here, it seems that the decrease in exported organic carbon (and hence presumably decreased remineralization) outweighs the expected decline in oxygen content due to warming (Deutsch

  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0006">2014</a>). Surface nitrate concentration decreases almost everywhere, as may be expected from reduced mixing. The exception is at the edges of the oligotrophic gyres, a pattern which appears only in the IPSL family of models and may be driven by decreased biomass of nanoplankton due to increased grazing pressure (Laufkötter 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0019">2015</a>). PP, nondiatom PP and export all have similar patterns, with decreasing trends throughout low latitudes likely due to increased stratification, and increasing trends in the Southern Ocean and Arctic, which are particularly pronounced in currently ice‐covered regions. Interestingly, chlorophyll shows the same patterns as PP except in the Arctic where chlorophyll decreases but PP increases. This is accompanied by a very strong increasing trend in nondiatom PP which suggests that diatoms are replaced by smaller phytoplankton with a lower chlorophyll : carbon ratio.
