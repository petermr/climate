 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CLIMEX is based on the response of a species to climate and does not explicitly include nonclimatic factors such as dispersal potential and biotic interactions in the modeling process Taylor et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0051">2012b</a>). The uncertainty related to future global greenhouse gas emission patterns also introduce further uncertainty to model projections (Kriticos et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0024">2006</a>). Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as providing an 
  <span class="italic">indication</span> of the direction and magnitude of change that may be expected in the future (Taylor et al. 
  <a rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31915-bib-0051">2012b</a>). The distribution maps provided here show areas of climatic suitability for 
  <span class="italic">M. peltata</span> and should not be treated as predicted future distributions. Other factors like lack of dispersal opportunities will also play a role in this species' potential future distribution.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The gridded climate datasets used in this study have a coarse resolution and may not reflect the climatic variation that can occur over small distances on the mountainous islands in the Pacific region. However, in the absence of finer resolution data sets, this study has utilized the best available data to perform the climate change modeling.</p>
