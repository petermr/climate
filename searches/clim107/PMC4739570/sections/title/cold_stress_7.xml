  <span class="italic">M. peltata's</span> global distribution were defined using two cold stress mechanisms. The cold stress temperature threshold (TTCS) was set at 10°C with the stress accumulation rate (THCS) set at −0.003 week
  <span class="sup">−1</span> while the Cold‐Stress Degree‐day Threshold (DTCS) was set at 20°C days, with the stress accumulation rate (DHCS) set at −0.003 week
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. These two mechanisms ensured that the potential distribution was restricted to the known northern and southern limits (Taylor et al.
