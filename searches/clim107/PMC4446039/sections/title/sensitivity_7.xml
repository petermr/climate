 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent to which intrinsic traits and environmental requirements render species sensitive to climate change was determined by collecting information on ten sensitivity factors (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124766.t001">Table 1</a>). Species were scored for each factor using information from the Australian federal government’s Species Profile and Threats Database [
  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref027">27</a>], draft and approved species recovery plans, conservation and listing advice, state level species information profiles, and relevant scientific literature (
  <a rid="pone.0124766.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124766.s007">S2 Dataset</a>). Recourse to the scientific literature was necessary primarily to derive scores for dispersal ability, reliance on pollinators and genetic variability (e.g. direct genetic variation estimates, or signs of a recent genetic bottleneck) which government databases and recovery plans often lacked.
