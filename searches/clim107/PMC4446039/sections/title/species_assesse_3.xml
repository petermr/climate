  <a rid="pone.0124766.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124766.ref028">28</a>] were selected from this list. We then randomly chose a species from each plant family to form a subset (n = 112) of plant species from the 705 listed plants with known population trends. Maps of the current distribution of the species were obtained from DSEWPaC [
