  <span class="italic">ξ

  </span>) indicates the logarithm of the population/month at risk included as an offset variable. This offset variable standardises dengue occurrence by population to compute estimations on the incidence rate rather than on the total number of dengue cases. To account for possible over-dispersion, we allowed the scale parameter to be different from the mean 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Cameron1">[33]</a>. This led to a quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson model, which is the standard consistent estimator for count variables

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The province-specific fixed effects control for province-specific omitted variable bias and un-modelled confounders such as social behaviour. The smooth function of time controls for long-term trends and seasonality that could arise from non-climatic factors such as resistance of the vector to insecticides, changes in the diagnostic techniques, holidays and seasonal water storage practices. To ensure the robustness of our results, we tested other specifications to account for long-term and seasonal trends including: 0,1 categorical variables for each year and for each season for the period, categorical variables for each year with a sinusoidal term for seasonal trends, and a linear trend with a sinusoidal term for seasonal trends. As is the case of the smooth function for time, our categorical variables account for long-term and seasonal changes that could happen as a consequence of confounding non-climatic factors such as seasonal water storage or year-specific disruptions in the public health systems. Estimations were conducted using the ‘mgcv’ package
