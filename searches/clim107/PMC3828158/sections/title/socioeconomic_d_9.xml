  <a rid="pntd.0002503-INEGI1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-INEGI1">[28]</a> for 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. The proportion of the population with access to piped water was also obtained from INEGI for 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. The share of the population living in urban areas (urbanisation) was obtained from the Chamber of Deputies 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-CEFP1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-CEFP1">[29]</a> for 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2004. Intervening years for these variables were estimated using linear interpolation. Yearly GDP per capita was obtained from the World Bank for the whole period of study. These data were then deflated at constant 2003 values. GDP data were originally aggregated at the national level. To obtain province-specific GDP estimates we assumed that the proportion of the national GDP for each province was the same as that for which GDP information were available (1993–2005) from INEGI. Thus, the province-specific proportion of GDP for the period 1985–1993 was assumed to be the same than that observed in 1993 on the INEGI data. Proportions for the subsequent years were assumed to be the same as in the INEGI data.
