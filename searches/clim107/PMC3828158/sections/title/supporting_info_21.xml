  <div class="caption">
   <p>Observed vs. GAM-estimated mean monthly dengue incidence. The figure shows a comparison between the observed and GAM-estimated mean monthly dengue incidence across Mexico during the whole year (upper), wet season (middle), and dry season (lower). The wet season occurs between November–April, and the dry season between May–Oct. Incidence is expressed in cases/100,000 people.</p>

   <p>Model estimates using different representations of long-term and seasonal trends. Values in bold font were significant at the 0.001 level. The original model is as in 
    <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0002503.e001" href="#pntd.0002503.e001">Equation 1</a>. Model 2 replaces the smooth variable of time (
    <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0002503.e001" href="#pntd.0002503.e001">Equation 1</a>) with categorical variables for calendar year and month. Model 3 uses categorical variables for calendar year and season. Model 4 includes a categorical variable for calendar year and a sinusoidal term for season. The sinusoidal term can be expressed as 
    <span class="italic">sin</span>(2×π×time/12)+
    <span class="italic">cos</span>(2×π×time/12), where time is an index variable 1,…,
    <span class="italic">n</span>. Model 5 includes a linear trend and a sinusoidal function identical to that for Model 4.
