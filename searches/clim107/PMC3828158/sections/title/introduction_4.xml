 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dengue is the most widely distributed and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO1">[1]</a>. This acute febrile disease affects all age groups 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO2">[2]</a>, and is caused by four antigenically distinct but genetically related viruses (serotypes) 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Wearing1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Wearing1">[3]</a>. Dengue has become endemic in over 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-east Asia and the Western Pacific 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO1">[1]</a>. Approximately 2.5 billion people are at risk from dengue transmission. About 50 million new dengue infections 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO1">[1]</a> and at least 12,000 deaths, mainly among children, occur worldwide every year 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO3">[4]</a>. The economic burden of dengue has been estimated at approximately 2.1 billion US dollars per annum in Latin America and the Caribbean alone 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Shepard1">[5]</a>. In some regions, such as the Americas, the economic losses caused by dengue are similar to those attributed to malaria and tuberculosis 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Torres1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Torres1">[6]</a>. As there are no specific antiviral medicines treating or vaccines preventing dengue, the only way to manage the disease is through the control of vector populations 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-AlMuhandis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-AlMuhandis1">[7]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global incidence rate of dengue has substantially increased over the last six decades (from about 900 annual cases reported to WHO over 1955—1959 to about 926 thousand annual cases over 2000—2007) 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO1">[1]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-WHO3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-WHO3">[4]</a> influenced by numerous mechanisms including population growth, unplanned urbanisation, increased travel and transportation of goods, lack of political will and limited resources for implementing effective control measures 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-AlMuhandis1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-AlMuhandis1">[7]</a>. The spatial distribution of the main dengue vector, 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>, has also increased over the last 25 years 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Jansen1">[8]</a>. Increases in both dengue incidence and 
  <span class="italic">A. aegypti</span> distribution have also been associated to variations in the climate system, including climate change (see references 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Lambrechts1">[9]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Sriprom1">[10]</a> for an example). The evidence of the effects of climate drivers on dengue incidence is still under debate 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Jansen1">[8]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Nagao1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Nagao1">[11]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper estimates the relative effects of weather (minimum and maximum temperature, and precipitation) on dengue accounting for a range of non-climatic factors (e.g. access to piped water, urbanisation, gross domestic product, and long-term trends and seasonality; see 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="s2" href="#s2">Methods</a>). Our model parameters are then used to project the potential effects of climate change on dengue incidence by 2030, 2050 and 2080 under three emission scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1) described by Nakicenovic and Swart 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-IPCC1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-IPCC1">[12]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several empirical models have been developed for estimating the effects of weather on dengue (for example, references 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Sriprom1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Johansson1">[13]</a>), and some of these have been used as a baseline to estimate the potential impacts of climate change on the future distribution and risk of dengue infection (for example, references 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Sriprom1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Confalonieri1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Confalonieri1">[14]</a>). However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in small geographical areas, covered relatively short periods of time, and include very limited non-climatic confounders (for example, references 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Sriprom1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Sriprom1">[10]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Johansson1">[13]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Schmidt1">[15]</a>) leading to several limitations. For example, small populations commonly result in low disease numbers leading to unstable risk estimations 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Olsen1">[16]</a>; small areas are also more likely to be climatically and socioeconomically homogeneous 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Elliott1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Elliott1">[17]</a>, 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Eisen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Eisen1">[18]</a>, making it harder to extrapolate the results to areas with greater climatic or socioeconomic variability.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our case-study has various unique features that minimize the identified problems. First, we used a large panel of province-specific data with a refined temporal resolution (monthly) covering the entirety of Mexico to investigate a greater geographical area (∼2 million km
  <span class="sup">2</span>), time frame (276 months), and number of reported cases (417,668) than previous studies. Second, the great socioeconomic heterogeneity 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-CONAPO1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-CONAPO1">[19]</a> and climatic diversity of Mexico, which includes both tropical and subtropical areas 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Mosio1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Mosio1">[20]</a>, allowed us to estimate robust and generalized relations between dengue, climatic and socioeconomic factors, which may be extrapolated to a large number of regions with similar climatic and socioeconomic features. Third, we control for the effect of potential un-observed confounders (e.g. social behaviour) by incorporating province-specific fixed-effects into our model. Fourth, we allowed for nonlinear relationships between dengue and weather by adopting a semi-parametric modelling approach. Specifically, we implemented a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) coupled with penalized likelihood function and an automated smoothing selection criterion, which estimated the optimal degree of nonlinearity of the model directly from the data 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-Wood1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-Wood1">[21]</a>. The advantage of this approach is that it determines the model flexibility within the actual estimation process. This method has been described in detail elsewhere
