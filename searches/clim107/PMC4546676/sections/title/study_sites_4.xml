 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our modeled streams are based on actual headwater streams in the Trask Watershed in northwestern Oregon, USA (
  <a rid="pone.0135334.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135334.s001">S1 Fig</a>); this location is part of a regional effort to understand the effects of forest harvest and climate change on fish (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://watershedsresearch.org/trask/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://watershedsresearch.org/trask/</span>). We simulated Gus Creek, Upper Mainstem Trask, Pothole Creek, and Rock Creek. Precipitation in the Trask Watershed study area occurs primarily during winter and varies by elevation, with rain at lower elevations and a mix of snow and rain at higher elevations. These climatic conditions, combined with steep terrain and shallow soils, lead to flashy winter flows linked to winter storms, followed by declining flows in spring and an extended low flow period in late summer [

  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref028">28</a>]. Our study period captured three years that were marginally higher in mean annual precipitation (2758 mm · y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 2834 mm · y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, 2783 mm · y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>), one year that was lower (2255mm · y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>), and one representative year (2626 mm · y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) when compared to the long-term annual mean (2500 mm ·y
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) for the Trask River watershed [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref029">29</a>]. Daily mean stream temperatures were moderate year-round ranging from 6–12°C. The fish communities of these streams were dominated by resident Coastal Cutthroat Trout 
  <span class="italic">Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii</span>, with sculpins 
  <span class="italic">Cottus</span> spp., juvenile Steelhead 
  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">mykiss</span>, and juvenile Coho Salmon 
  <span class="italic">O</span>. 
  <span class="italic">kisutch</span> at some sites. Movement of fish among study streams consists of a very small rate of exchange (&lt;1%, J. Dunham, unpublished data), which is likely not important demographically [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref030">30</a>]. In these coastal streams, resident Coastal Cutthroat Trout spawn in the spring generally in April and May with fry commonly emerging from April to August [
  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref031">31</a>]. Although trout grow all year, most growth for age 1+ trout occurs in winter and spring [

  <a rid="pone.0135334.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135334.ref033">33</a>]). Average summer flows were similar among all streams, but flows in Rock Creek were more variable in summer. Although Rock Creek was the largest stream in watershed area, it had similar availability of habitat in summer relative to Gus Creek, which is half its watershed area. Gus Creek has the most variable flow in winter, and at times it exceeded flows in Rock Creek. Upper Mainstem was the coldest stream year-round, and it was the smallest in both watershed area and wetted summer area. Pothole Creek had the highest and most variable turbidity in winter and the lowest in summer.
