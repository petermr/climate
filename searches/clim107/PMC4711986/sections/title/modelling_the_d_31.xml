 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and precipitation were the best contributors to the models such that the resulting maps depicted similar distribution patterns in both species (

The sectors with high occurrence probabilities were distributed in lowlands and low occurrence areas were restricted to highlands and inland deserts. There were, however, some differences. While the meadow pipit was mostly related to western lowlands where Atlantic rains drain, the chiffchaff showed a broader distribution. Interestingly, the models fitted well to the present distribution of the species, with higher occupancy and abundance in sectors where the Maxent models suggest high climate suitability (
