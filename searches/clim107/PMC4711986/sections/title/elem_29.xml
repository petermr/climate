  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of climate on the present distribution of migratory birds</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution is shaped by features acting at different scales [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref064">64</a>]. In the case of migratory birds, distribution results from large-scale geographical and climate processes affecting the historical configuration of migratory routes [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref065">65</a>] and the local arrangement of individuals according to their particular habitat preferences [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref029">29</a>]. Multi-scale approaches are thus required to detect the contribution of climate versus other features on the distribution of migratory birds [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref023">23</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref066" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref066">66</a>]. This has been the aim of the present study in which the distribution of wintering pipits and chiffchaffs has been related to large scale (geography and climate) and local (vegetation cover) predictor variables (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146958.t001">Table 1</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of latitude on bird distribution provided inconclusive results. The meadow pipit was more abundant in the northernmost sectors supporting the predicted effect of the distance to breeding grounds on winter distribution. However, the occupancy of the chiffchaff showed an opposite pattern, perhaps because in this species many individuals winter in the Sahel [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref043">43</a>]. Thus, the study area is not the actual southern border of its wintering area. After controlling for the geographical effects, the results supported habitat structure and climate as key players in bird distribution. Woodland cover was related to the occurrence of the chiffchaff (positive) and the meadow pipit (negative). In both cases, abundance was positively related to grass cover. These results are congruent with the habitat preferences of the species since the meadow pipit prefers grass patches in open habitats and the chiffchaff feeds on a broad variety of substrata (included tall grasses) in shrub- and tree-covered habitats [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref042">42</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref043">43</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate variables were related to bird distribution supporting the presence of more pipits and chiffchaffs in warmer sectors (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146958.t001">Table 1</a>). Preferences for warmer areas could be explained by the predicted direct effect of low temperatures on thermoregulation costs (see 
   <a rid="sec001" ref-type="sec" href="#sec001">Introduction</a>). In an area dominated by cold mountains and highlands (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g001">Fig 1</a>), where most sectors show mean winter temperatures (mean ± SE: 9.36°C ± 0.18; min-max: -2.2 to 16.7°C; n = 493; see 
   <a rid="sec005" ref-type="sec" href="#sec005">methods</a>) under the usual thermoneutral zone of passerines [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref067">67</a>], birds may be forced to increase metabolism [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref068" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref068">68</a>] or to leave colder sectors [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref036">36</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref069">69</a>]. In addition to this effect of thermal landscape on bird distribution, meadow pipits were positively related to precipitation. Autumn and winter rains mitigate the effect of summer drought in the Mediterranean and favour primary productivity and food availability for wintering birds [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref011">11</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref039">39</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref040">40</a>]. This effect could be magnified by the use of ground by the meadow pipits as feeding substratum [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref042">42</a>]. In the Mediterranean region, grass growth and the superficial activity of ground invertebrates are strongly related to the moisture produced by autumn and winter rains on dry ground layers resulting from summer drought [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref038">38</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref070">70</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref071">71</a>]. In this way, more precipitation will result in more suitable food patches for this species [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref048">48</a>]. Thus, it can be concluded that rain-mediated productivity and thermal landscapes can provide a causal explanation of climate features affecting the distribution of these small passerines in the study area.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modelling the distribution of climate suitability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature and precipitation were the best contributors to the models such that the resulting maps depicted similar distribution patterns in both species (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g004">Fig 4</a>). The sectors with high occurrence probabilities were distributed in lowlands and low occurrence areas were restricted to highlands and inland deserts. There were, however, some differences. While the meadow pipit was mostly related to western lowlands where Atlantic rains drain, the chiffchaff showed a broader distribution. Interestingly, the models fitted well to the present distribution of the species, with higher occupancy and abundance in sectors where the Maxent models suggest high climate suitability (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146958.t003">Table 3</a>). This supports the usefulness of models resulting from ring recoveries and suitable climate variables to predict the geographical distribution of wintering in these birds [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of climate change on bird distribution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to IPCC predictions [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref072">72</a>], mean temperature will increase and precipitation will decrease in the study area over the next few decades. These changes will not be spatially homogeneous in the study area. Some southern sectors will be more affected by changes (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g003">Fig 3</a>) and, within this latitudinal trend, temperature increases will grow and precipitation loss will decline in the highlands (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.t004" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146958.t004">Table 4</a>). This change has been reported in other studies of the effect of elevation on climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref073" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref073">73</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref074" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref074">74</a>]. As a result, and according to the reported effects of winter temperature and precipitation on the meadow pipit and chiffchaff, the models predict two main trends in climate suitability. First, mean climate suitability will improve for the two species in the Iberian Peninsula and the western Maghreb. This change seems to be related to the warming of highlands in a region where 80% of the land is over 300 m and 60% over 600 m a.s.l. (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g001">Fig 1</a>). In this way, the improvement of winter conditions produced by warming of elevated areas, similar to that reported in northern areas, will provide small birds the possibility to cope with winter conditions more successfully [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref036">36</a>]. Second, despite the overall improvement of winter conditions, some sectors will be more vulnerable to the damaging effects of climate change in some species. This is true for the warmer lowlands of the south where the predicted decrease in precipitation will reduce the climate suitability for the meadow pipit, a species linked to moist areas (see above). The fate of water resources is a key concern in the drier sectors of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref012">12</a>,

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prospects</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study suggests five main aspects for consideration in the assessment of the weaknesses and strengths of the resulting patterns. First, it is important to consider the representativeness of the two model species. They are insectivorous and ubiquitous birds similar to many other European partial-migratory passerines [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref010">10</a>]. However, the alleged ability of pipits and chiffchaffs to track climate change over the study region may not apply to stenotopic species or birds forced to track resources with patchy distribution (e.g. water birds, frugivorous species). Second, it is important to state that these results refer to a scenario in which other features (e.g. vegetation cover and composition, agricultural practices, etc.) will also vary as a response to climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref075">75</a>]. As a result, climate change could promote synergetic interactions within and among species, evolutionary and ecological processes and human impact that are difficult to predict [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref005">5</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref033">33</a>]. Third, temperature and precipitation appear to be two main drivers of bird distribution because changes in these parameters affect the energy available for birds (see 
   <a rid="sec001" ref-type="sec" href="#sec001">Introduction</a>). Since energy availability has been reported to be a global driver of bird distribution, changes in these variables are probably suitable indicators of changes in other species and regions [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref076">76</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref077" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref077">77</a>]. Finally, the results highlight the main role of elevation in shaping the retreat of low latitudinal margins of Mediterranean winter ranges of birds reported in this paper. This role of elevation will probably apply in other highlands of the Mediterranean basin (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g001">Fig 1</a>) and the planet where winter conditions for birds can benefit from warming [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref067">67</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref070">70</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref078">78</a>]. This main role of highlands in reshuffling the wintering ranges of migratory birds in the Mediterranean basin suggests two additional observations: a) Mediterranean highlands are usually reported as refuges for species retreating northwards due to the effect of postglacial warming [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref079" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref079">79</a>]. The results in this paper suggest a similar buffer effect on wintering ranges of migratory birds. The huge expanses of Mediterranean highlands (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g001">Fig 1</a>), usually avoided by many birds in winter [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref039">39</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref040">40</a>], would progressively increase climate suitability as warming progresses. b) However, this projected climate improvement of highlands will not be sufficient to predict an increase in migratory populations in this wintering region since warming in northern areas may reduce migratory journeys to the south [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref003">3</a>]. Alternatively, it has been postulated that warming of Mediterranean highlands could exert a positive influence on the size of local bird populations favouring winter residency and enhancing winter survival [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref028">28</a>].
