 <xref rid="pone.0146958.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Since we propose that small birds avoid cold areas to prevent excessive thermoregulatory requirements, and precipitation may affect the productivity of Mediterranean habitats after summer drought (see 
 <xref rid="sec001" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Introduction</xref>), we selected Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter (bio11) and Precipitation of Coldest Quarter of the year (bio19) as the two main climate correlates of bird distribution. In addition, we included Precipitation Seasonality (bio15) as a surrogate of the rain-mediated productive pulses typical of many dry habitats that track migratory birds [

Despite strong differences in sample size affecting the means (50 vs. 2 years), climate variables depicted similar trends (bio 11, r: 0.93; bio15:0.69 and bio19:0.70, p&lt;0.001 in all cases) supporting the usefulness of climate data used in this paper to explore the features affecting the present spatial distribution of birds.
