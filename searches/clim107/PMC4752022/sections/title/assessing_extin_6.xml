 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although a growing wealth of studies predict increased extinction risk for species because of climate change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-50">50</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-51">51</a>
  </span>, many of these vary enormously in their estimations. It is also increasingly recognized that the predictions of extinction risk do not reflect the number of species that have become vulnerable (or extinct) to date, nor do they match the number identified as threatened because of climate change on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (only 10.5% of the 22,176 species) 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-52">52</a>
  </span>. A fundamental challenge has involved integrating the projections of species niche models (the most-often used tool for assessing the impacts of climate change on species) into the processes of real-world extinction assessments.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simple measures of population size, geographic range size, and other indicators of current status already used as IUCN Red List criteria are likely to be good predictors of climate change-associated extinction risk 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-53">53</a>
  </span>. Such IUCN Red List criteria have been used to predict the risk of extinction in the absence of conservation action and the time lag between assessment and extinction 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-54">54</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-55">55</a>
  </span>. This time lag amounts to a warning period in which adaptation efforts can be taken to prevent extinction. Although there is a warning period, it is finite and thus delays in developing and implementing conservation plans after a species is identified as being threatened could be costly. Roughly half of listed species are likely to go extinct within 20 years of being listed as critically endangered 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-54">54</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional challenge is that most species risk assessments treat climate change as a problem driven by relatively slow, predictable, and continuous change in environmental conditions and fail to account for other important components of climate change, such as increasing extreme weather and climate events (for example, cyclones, floods, and drought) 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-56">56</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-57">57</a>
  </span>. It is increasingly recognized that the increases in frequencies and intensities of extreme events are critical determinants of patterns of biological diversity and will affect it differently from impacts resulting from steady climate change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-58">58</a>
  </span>. A good example of this is how climate change will impact bat species: extreme maximum temperature is now considered a critical factor in the vulnerability of bats to climate change 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-59">59</a>
  </span>, but many studies (for example, 
  <a rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-60">60</a>) fail to consider it in projections of species distributions under climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even though our understanding of which extremes are most important and how they are shifting is limited 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-61">61</a>
  </span>, there are good examples of assessments that do account for extremes. Recently, Ameca y Juárez and colleagues 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-62">62</a>
  </span> produced a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of cyclones and droughts on terrestrial mammals, one of the few large-scale studies to consider exposure to extreme events. They followed this exposure analysis with an assessment of terrestrial mammal sensitivity to extreme weather and climate events, identifying biological traits that make large terrestrial mammals more susceptible to climate-induced population declines.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alongside species risk assessments, the assessment of the vulnerability of species to climate change—as well as the climate-related vulnerability of places and natural resources in general—has emerged as an important step in the adaptation process 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-63">63</a>
  </span>. As with extinction risk assessments, many different approaches to assessing vulnerability have been proposed (for example, 
  <a rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-64">64</a>), each evaluating some subset or combination of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-65">65</a>
  </span>. These vulnerability assessments serve not only to determine which species are likely to be most vulnerable but also to identify the factors that make a species vulnerable and thus potential conservation actions—adaptation measures—that can be taken to reduce vulnerability.
