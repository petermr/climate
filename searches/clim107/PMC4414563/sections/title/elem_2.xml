  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change scepticism</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One factor that is crucial for people’s 
   <span class="italic">motivation to mitigate</span> climate change is the extent to which people believe or doubt that climate change is real and will have serious effects. If people are sceptical about climate change, it is unlikely that they will act upon it. In line with this reasoning, some studies showed that higher levels of scepticism are associated with lower levels of endorsement of mitigation [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>]. Others, however, have found no relationship between scepticism and mitigation [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref013">13</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref014">14</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is some evidence that people low in scepticism are more likely to take actions to 
   <span class="italic">adapt</span> to climate change than those high in scepticism [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref009">9</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref015">15</a>]. However, it is also plausible that people who are sceptical about the reality and relevance of climate change may endorse adaptation measures. More specifically, if adaptation is understood as a possible future alternative to costly and unnecessary (from a sceptical point of view) mitigation efforts in the present, endorsing adaptation is an excuse for not taking any mitigation actions now [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref016">16</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref018">18</a>] (see also [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref019">19</a>]). In other words, it is possible that climate change sceptics favour adaptation over mitigation because it allows them to stall and block mitigation efforts.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attitudes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Until recently, climate change has almost exclusively been framed as an environmental problem [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref020">20</a>]. Correspondingly, the general population is well aware that climate change will harm the environment [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>] and their attitude towards nature and its protection should play some role in accounting for individual differences in mitigating climate change. Previous research confirms that people with strong pro-environmental attitudes are more likely to mitigate climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>]. Given that people who positively evaluate environmental protection usually also hold positive attitudes towards nature in general [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref024">24</a>], we expect the relationship between attitude towards nature and endorsement of mitigation to be positive too.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because adaptation has multiple foci—for example, maintaining human safety—the specific goal of protecting the environment is less prominent for this action than for mitigation [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref002">2</a>]. Indeed, adaptive responses can, sometimes, entail actively changing the environment (e.g., construction of sea dikes to protect inhabited areas from future sea-level rise). We therefore assume that attitude towards nature and attitude towards environmental protection will be positively related to endorsement of adaptation, but not as strongly as these attitudes are related to endorsement of mitigation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Risk perceptions</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another important requisite for acting on a threat is the extent to which people feel at risk. Risks can be processed in two different ways: Analytically or affectively. The 
   <span class="italic">analytical</span> processing mode is thought to be slow and deliberative. It deals with abstract symbols and numbers and is used to think about the future or hypothetical events. The 
   <span class="italic">affective</span> processing mode, on the other hand, is fast and does not need any conscious effort. It relies on intuition, experiences, images, and associations [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref025">25</a>]. Importantly, the two processing modes are not independent of each other. They work in parallel and influence our behaviour in conjunction with our decisions [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref026">26</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When used to explain people’s endorsement of 
   <span class="italic">mitigation</span>, both analytic and affective appraisals of risks have been found to be reliable predictors: The more people considered climate change as a risk and the more negative feelings they had about it, the more they were willing to mitigate [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref013">13</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>]. The relevance of risk perceptions for endorsement of 
   <span class="italic">adaptation</span> measures is less clear [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref027">27</a>]. Most studies that investigated risk perceptions explicitly related to climate change found no relevant (or only a negligible) link with people’s level of adaptation support [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref028">28</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref029">29</a>]. This is unexpected, as it conflicts with theoretical work that considers risk perceptions as a crucial factor for people’s motivation to act in response to climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref030">30</a>] and is inconsistent with more general research on hazard preparedness, which typically finds that risk perceptions are strongly related to people’s willingness to take preventive measures [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref031">31</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within analytical risk perception another differentiation should be made when dealing with climate change: that of generalised risks (e.g., to other people) versus the risks that are seen to be self-relevant to the individual contemplating action. Typically, people estimate the risks to others to be greater than those to themselves [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref032">32</a>], something that can interfere with taking action because it deflects personal relevance and responsibility. This type of thinking has also been highlighted in relation to the risks of climate change: People generally perceive climate change as a distant threat, something that affects strangers, and that happens in remote times and places rather than here and now [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref033">33</a>]. The perception of climate change as a distant threat could lead to the perspective that climate change risks are irrelevant to the individual and that there is no need for personal action. Put the other way around, when climate change is perceived as a phenomenon with proximal consequences, then people should also have a greater sense of urgency and responsibility, and should ultimately be more motivated to respond to climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref034">34</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref036">36</a>]. The assumption that proximal risk perceptions should increase people’s willingness to act seems especially relevant with regard to adaptation, given its predominantly local focus [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref006">6</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref037">37</a>]. Haden and colleagues [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>] provide some empirical evidence for this assumption. They found that the more farmers were concerned about future 
   <span class="italic">local</span> water availability, the more they were willing to adapt to climate change by adopting new irrigation practices.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The distinction between proximal and distant risk perceptions also warrants some comments with regard to mitigation. One the one hand, the common assumption that an increased sense of proximal risks motivates people to mitigate [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref034">34</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref035">35</a>] makes intuitive sense. On the other hand, the global scale at which mitigation works [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref004">4</a>] suggests that distant risk perceptions could also be positively linked to endorsement of mitigation, especially among people who are 
   <span class="italic">more</span> concerned about places at a more distant level than they are about proximal places [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref007">7</a>]. Consistent with this reasoning, one study found that the more farmers were concerned about distant climate change, the more they were willing to adopt new mitigation practices [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>]. Thus, there are theoretical reasons for and against the superiority of proximal risk perceptions over distant risk perceptions as a predictor of mitigation support; moreover, some evidence suggests that distant risk perceptions might be more relevant for motivating mitigation than proximal risk perceptions.
