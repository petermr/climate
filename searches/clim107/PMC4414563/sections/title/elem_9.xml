  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the degree to which people were 
   <span class="italic">sceptical</span> about human-made climate change, we adopted seven previously used items [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref040">40</a>] and added an item that referred to the previous unusually cold winter. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with these statements (see 
   <a rid="pone.0124843.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s005">S1 Table</a> for all items used). The seven items formed a reliable scale (Cronbach’s α in the UK survey =. 85, Cronbach’s α in the Swiss survey =. 87).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess 
   <span class="italic">attitude towards environmental protection</span> (Swiss sample), we used a behaviour-based attitude measure with 50 items [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref041">41</a>]. This instrument included 18 items with a yes/no response and 32 items with a frequency scale. The 50 items of the environmental attitude measure formed a reliable scale (α =. 86).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The more general 
   <span class="italic">attitude towards nature</span> consisted of 40 items (Swiss sample), of which 26 were presented as behavioural self-reports and 14 as evaluative statements [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref024">24</a>]. The 40 items formed a reliable scale (α =. 84).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the UK survey we used four items to assess people’s 
   <span class="italic">attitude towards addressing climate change</span> (items taken from [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>]). The reliability of this scale was acceptable (α =. 59).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess 
   <span class="italic">risk perceptions</span>, we asked people to judge the likelihood that seven (identical) risks [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>] would occur as a consequence of climate change either close to or far away from where they live. The seven items formed reliable scales both for the proximal (α
   <sub>UK</sub> =. 83; α
   <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 76) and distant level (α
   <sub>UK</sub> =. 90; α
   <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 83).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Swiss survey, we assessed 
   <span class="italic">affective risk perception</span> by asking participants about their emotional reaction when they thought about climate change (1 = very positive, 7 = very negative; [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref042">42</a>]). In the UK survey, participants were first asked if they had any negative feelings about climate change (1 = 
   <span class="italic">none</span>). If they replied with “yes”, they were also asked to rate the degree of their negative feelings (2 = 
   <span class="italic">slightly</span>, 5 = 
   <span class="italic">extremely</span>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dependent measures</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure participants’ 
   <span class="italic">support for mitigation policies</span>, respondents were presented with a selection of steps to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases “as a society” and then asked how they would vote on them in a national referendum [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>]. We adapted eight questions—some with slightly different wordings—from the literature [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref043">43</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref044">44</a>] and created six new questions. The 14 propositions to mitigate climate change as a collective formed a reliable scale (α
   <sub>UK</sub> =. 90, α
   <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 89).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants were presented with a brief introduction (see 
   <a rid="pone.0124843.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s003">S1 Fig</a>) explaining the need and the rationale underlying the idea of adaptation. To assess 
   <span class="italic">support for pro-active adaptation policies</span>, we developed a catalogue of 15 adaptation measures that were guided by adaptation research [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref045">45</a>] and by strategies from large cities [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref046">46</a>]. The proposed adaptation measures focused on conservation of species, protection against water scarcity, heat, and floods. Participants were told that there were many steps that “we can take as a society to adapt to climate change” and then asked to indicate how much they would support different adaptation measures. The 15 items formed a reliable scale (α
   <sub>UK</sub> =. 89, α
   <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 83).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used ten items to assess 
   <span class="italic">people’s future intentions to engage in behaviours to mitigate</span> climate change (UK sample) and asked them how likely they were to take these actions. The topics revolved around mobility, energy saving, consumption, and political behaviours. The proposed ten actions formed a reliable scale in the UK survey (α =. 78). For lack of space we could not include this measure in the Swiss survey.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also presented (UK) participants with eight actions they could individually take to adapt to climate change impacts. The eight personal behavioural intentions to adapt formed a reliable scale (α =. 81). (Again, there was no space for these questions in the Swiss survey).</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To explore whether our newly developed dependent variables measure one-dimensional concepts, we conducted a series of exploratory factor analyses. We first ran two principal axis factoring analyses that included either the personal behavioural intentions to mitigate or to adapt (since personal behavioural intentions were not assessed in Switzerland, the analyses were only performed with the UK sample). We then explored (in both samples) the dimensionality of the mitigation and adaptation policy support items. All six analyses revealed that the items were suitable for factor analysis (KMO and Bartlett’s test, 
   <a rid="pone.0124843.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s008">S4</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0124843.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s011">S7</a> Tables). Although the presence of more than one factor with an eigenvalue larger than one would suggest keeping several factors according to the Kaiser criterion [
   <a rid="pone.0124843.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref047">47</a>], the eigenvalues of the first factor were considerably larger than the ones of the second factor (scree plots, 
   <a rid="pone.0124843.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s004">S2 Fig</a>). We therefore decided to retain the anticipated and theoretically more meaningful one-dimensional solutions.
