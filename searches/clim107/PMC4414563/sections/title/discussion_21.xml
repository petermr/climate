 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study provides consistent evidence from two countries that public endorsement of mitigation and adaptation are strongly linked to each other and that the two response strategies are endorsed for similar reasons. People who were willing to mitigate climate change—be it on a personal level by changing their behaviour or on a societal level by supporting policies—also supported personal and societal steps to adapt to negative consequences from climate change, and vice versa.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It also seems that the psychological processes involved in peoples’ motivation to respond to climate change are very similar for these two strategies: People who believe that climate change is real, who have positive attitudes about protecting the environment and about addressing climate change, and who perceive climate change as a risk, are willing to endorse both mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The finding that surprised us most, and that opens new avenues for future research, concerns the relationship between risk perceptions and the level at which response strategies are implemented. A common idea is that people are not willing to address climate change because they perceive it as a distant threat and that their motivation could be increased by making local consequences more salient [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref034">34</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref035">35</a>]. If “localising” is an effective means to increase individual engagement with climate change, as is often expected, then proximal risk perceptions should outperform distant risk perceptions as a predictor for every dependent variable. However, it was 
  <span class="italic">distant</span> risk perceptions that better predicted people’s willingness to support mitigation and adaptation policies rather than 
  <span class="italic">proximal</span> risk perceptions (
  <a rid="pone.0124843.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124843.t002">Table 2</a>). Neither was proximal risk perception superior in terms of personal behavioural intentions to mitigate (
  <a rid="pone.0124843.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124843.t003">Table 3</a>); both proximal and distant risk perceptions uniquely contributed to the prediction of personal behavioural intentions. It was only with regard to personal adaptation intentions that we found the expected superiority of proximal risk perceptions as a predictor.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Construal Level Theory [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref048">48</a>], a dominant theory in the current psychological literature, provides a possible explanation for the unexpected associations between proximal risks and personal behavioural intentions as well as between distant risks and policy support. Construal Level Theory posits that human perceptions of the world and the way individuals make judgments depend on the psychological distance between the self and the events or objects being dealt with. Low psychological distance means that we are focused on ourselves, our current geographic location, and the present time. Conversely, when psychological distance is high, then we focus on other people, faraway places and the distant future or past.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variables we used to assess analytical risks and willingness to respond to climate change neatly map onto two dimensions of psychological distance: Proximal and distant risk perceptions can be mapped onto the dimension of spatial distance; personal behavioural intentions and policy support can be mapped onto the social dimension of psychological distance (
  <span class="italic">I</span> vs. 
  <span class="italic">we</span> do something). Perhaps the unexpected strong relationships we found between proximal risk perceptions and personal behavioural intentions on the one hand, and between distant risk perceptions and policy support on the other hand, are due to spontaneous matches with regard to psychological distance. Proximal risk perceptions are psychologically 
  <span class="italic">proximal on the spatial dimension</span> and personal behavioural intentions can be regarded as 
  <span class="italic">proximal on the social dimension</span> (it is the individual who forms the intentions). Likewise, the 
  <span class="italic">spatially remote</span> distant risk perceptions can be matched to support for policies, which can be regarded as 
  <span class="italic">distant on the social dimension</span> (policies involve strangers and collective action). Importantly, the proposed spontaneous matches would be consistent with the empirically corroborated proposition of Construal Level Theory saying that different dimensions of psychological distance (e.g., social and spatial distance) are related to each other [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref048">48</a>]. To some extent this proposition has also been observed with regard to people’s perception of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref036">36</a>]. It is therefore plausible that the observed links between the risk perspective and level of implementation are due to a similar level of psychological distance from the individual and, therefore, due to a corresponding level of mental construal.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This Construal Level Theory interpretation of our findings resembles the proposition that mitigation and adaptation strategies are in themselves linked to specific construal levels. Haden and colleagues (2012) argued that because mitigation is a collective problem that requires global action (i.e., involving greater spatial and social distance), this strategy is represented more abstractly than adaptation, which instead deals with local problems that directly affect the individual (i.e., involving less spatial and social distance). Our findings add to this literature by showing that the distinction of personal versus societal responses to climate change may be helpful to understand how different aspects of psychological distance affect endorsement of mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Construal Level Theory perspective leads to some counter-intuitive corollaries that are relevant for climate change communication. The relationships we observed between spatially varying risk perspectives and the two levels of implementation imply that appeals to change personal behaviour and to increase support for policies are most effective when they are combined with spatial information that is consistent with their respective construal. This logic is consistent with the reasoning of Construal Level Theory and with empirical findings on the effectiveness of matching construal levels [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref049">49</a>]. The importance of matching levels could also explain why previous attempts to increase people’s engagement with climate change by portraying proximal impacts (i.e., low-level construal) were not successful in increasing support for policies and strengthening attitudes towards climate change mitigation (both high-level construals [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref050">50</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref051">51</a>]). In short, on the basis of our results and current theory, we suggest that a proximal focus does not 
  <span class="italic">per se</span> lead to more involvement and stronger motivation to act on climate change (for a similar argument, see [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref036">36</a>]). Rather, climate change communication could be much more effective if different levels of construals are intentionally matched: Focussing people’s attention on local climate change seems well suited to enhance their willingness to take personal actions, probably more so if these actions are related to adaptation [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>]. However, with regard to support for policies it seems more effective to address the issue of climate change on a bigger scale and therefore remove climate change spatially from people rather than bring it closer to them [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref051">51</a>], especially if these policies concern mitigation [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref038">38</a>].
