 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the degree to which people were 
  <span class="italic">sceptical</span> about human-made climate change, we adopted seven previously used items [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref040">40</a>] and added an item that referred to the previous unusually cold winter. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with these statements (see 
  <a rid="pone.0124843.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s005">S1 Table</a> for all items used). The seven items formed a reliable scale (Cronbach’s α in the UK survey =. 85, Cronbach’s α in the Swiss survey =. 87).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess 
  <span class="italic">attitude towards environmental protection</span> (Swiss sample), we used a behaviour-based attitude measure with 50 items [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref041">41</a>]. This instrument included 18 items with a yes/no response and 32 items with a frequency scale. The 50 items of the environmental attitude measure formed a reliable scale (α =. 86).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The more general 
  <span class="italic">attitude towards nature</span> consisted of 40 items (Swiss sample), of which 26 were presented as behavioural self-reports and 14 as evaluative statements [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref024">24</a>]. The 40 items formed a reliable scale (α =. 84).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the UK survey we used four items to assess people’s 
  <span class="italic">attitude towards addressing climate change</span> (items taken from [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref021">21</a>]). The reliability of this scale was acceptable (α =. 59).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess 
  <span class="italic">risk perceptions</span>, we asked people to judge the likelihood that seven (identical) risks [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref023">23</a>] would occur as a consequence of climate change either close to or far away from where they live. The seven items formed reliable scales both for the proximal (α
  <sub>UK</sub> =. 83; α
  <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 76) and distant level (α
  <sub>UK</sub> =. 90; α
  <sub>Switzerland</sub> =. 83).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Swiss survey, we assessed 
  <span class="italic">affective risk perception</span> by asking participants about their emotional reaction when they thought about climate change (1 = very positive, 7 = very negative; [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref042">42</a>]). In the UK survey, participants were first asked if they had any negative feelings about climate change (1 = 
  <span class="italic">none</span>). If they replied with “yes”, they were also asked to rate the degree of their negative feelings (2 = 
  <span class="italic">slightly</span>, 5 = 
  <span class="italic">extremely</span>).
