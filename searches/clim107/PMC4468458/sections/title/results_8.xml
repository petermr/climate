 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effects of climate change on pregnancy outcomes were considered. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1</a> presents the study flowchart. 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">Table 1</a> shows the data extracted from articles included in this review. Different studies were conducted around the world including Asia, Europe, and America; most of them were from America and Europe. The studies were performed according to different methods and principles. Effects of the temperature, different seasons of fertilization time, season of childbirth, humidity and month of childbirth were assessed in these studies. Many diverse measurable outcomes were considered, e.g., eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio and length of pregnancy. Approximately all studies have reported a significant relationship between exposure variable and intended outcome. According to conducted studies, decrease in birth weight is more possible in cold months and winter. Increase in temperature was followed by increase in PTB rate. PTB was higher in exposure of the January to February months compared to March to October months.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studies had presented different results about eclampsia and preeclampsia; however, according to most of the studies, they were more prevalent in cold and humid seasons. Some studies have reported higher risk in winter and some in summer. About the effect of month and season of fertilization on eclampsia and preeclampsia, it was shown that fertilization in the summer might increase the risk of these two conditions compared to fertilization in fall and winter.</p>
