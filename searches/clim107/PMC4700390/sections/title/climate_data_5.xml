 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used global monthly mean temperatures for the current climatic period (to 2000), calculated at a 30 arcsec resolution from WorldClim (Hijmans et al. 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">2005</a>), and clipped to the African continent. For future climate predictions, we used HadCM3 climate projections for 2020, 2050, and 2080 and selected SRES A1B emission scenarios, downscaled using the delta method (Ramirez and Jarvis 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2008</a>). The A1B scenario falls in the center of projections of anthropogenic emissions and makes a general assumption of continuing globalization (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
  <a rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20">2007b</a>), while avoiding extremes. The delta method uses the long-term monthly mean of temperature generated by the HadCM3 global climate model to calculate anomalies for the generated time series (Ramirez and Jarvis 
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">2008</a>), which are applied to higher-resolution temperature surfaces from WorldClim. We chose this method for its simplicity and sufficiency for continental level intermodel comparison. We aggregated the 5 arcmin (∼0.083°) data to 0.1° to match the data used to project the
