  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) are evaluated locally in the extreme event. The net condensation rate is approximated by − 
  <span class="italic">ωS</span> either through consideration of the condensation rate in a rising saturated air parcel [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] or using a dry static energy budget in the tropics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. The precipitation efficiency 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> is defined as the ratio of surface precipitation to the column-integrated net condensation; it accounts for condensate and precipitation storage or transport from the column. Note that 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> is not a conventional precipitation efficiency because it is defined in terms of net condensation (condensation minus evaporation) rather than condensation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>), changes in the precipitation rate in extreme events under climate change have a dynamical contribution from changes in 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>, a thermodynamic contribution from changes in 
  <span class="italic">S</span> (this is termed thermodynamic since 
  <span class="italic">S</span> only depends on temperature and pressure), and a microphysical component from changes in the precipitation efficiency 
  <span class="italic">ε</span>. Relative humidity does not explicitly appear in Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>), but it can affect precipitation extremes through the dynamics and by helping to set the duration of precipitation events. The fractional increase in 
  <span class="italic">S</span> with warming is influenced by changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>] and varies strongly depending on temperature and therefore altitude in the atmosphere. However, for a moist-adiabatic stratification and convergence confined to near the surface, the thermodynamic contribution can be shown to scale in a similar way to near surface specific humidities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]. This scaling is often referred to as Clausius-Clapeyron scaling and gives a sensitivity of 6–7 % K
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for typical surface temperatures. More generally, the thermodynamic contribution depends on the weighting of 
  <span class="italic">S</span> by the vertical velocity profile in the vertical integral in Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>), and a range of higher and lower rates of change from the thermodynamic contribution have been found in different simulations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" href="#CR73">73</a>•]. It is sometimes stated that the dynamical contribution must be positive for a warming climate because of increases in latent heating, but this is not necessarily the case because other factors such as increases in dry static stability or reductions in meridional temperature gradients can counteract the increases in latent heating. Instead, the dynamical contribution is discussed here separately for different dynamical regimes. For example, increases in convective updraft velocities with warming are discussed in the next paragraph, and changes in large-scale vertical velocities in the extratropics are discussed in the “
  <a rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec5">Extratropical Precipitation Extremes</a>” section using the omega equation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simplest configuration for which the contributions to changes in precipitation extremes have been analyzed is radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) in a doubly periodic domain [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>]. There are no large-scale dynamics in RCE, and cloud-system resolving models (CRMs) are used to resolve the convective-scale dynamics. Both the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the updraft velocities in the middle and upper troposphere increase with warming in RCE [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>]; as the atmosphere warms, the thermal stratification remains close to neutral to a strongly entraining plume, and this implies increases in CAPE (calculated based on a non-entraining parcel) and increases in updraft velocities for more weakly entraining plumes [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>]. But, the increases in updraft velocities in the upper troposphere do not strongly affect the precipitation extremes, because the factor of 
  <span class="italic">S</span>(
  <span class="italic">T, p</span>) in Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) gives more weight to the vertical velocities in the lower troposphere in determining the intensity of precipitation extremes. For surface temperatures near those of the present-day tropics, the precipitation extremes increase at close to the thermodynamic rate, and this is close to Clausius-Clapeyron scaling with the surface specific humidity, with relatively small contributions from changes in vertical velocities and precipitation efficiency [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" href="#CR70">70</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>]. The same behavior is found when convection is organized in a squall line [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>•]. However, for temperatures below 295 K, the precipitation efficiency can change substantially with warming and the scaling of precipitation extremes then depends on the accumulation period considered [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>], as discussed in the “
  <a rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec9">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</a>” section.
