 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The multimodel-median sensitivity is shown by the green line with circles in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>, and the multimodel median of the sensitivity averaged over the extratropics is 6 % K
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. A slightly lower extratropical sensitivity of 5 % K
  <span class="sup">−1</span> is obtained if it is normalized by the change in extratropical-mean surface temperature rather than global-mean surface temperature. The intermodel spread in the response (dotted lines in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>) is small in the extratropics, consistent with the fact that most extratropical precipitation extremes are associated with cyclones and fronts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" href="#CR69">69</a>] that may be expected to be reasonably well simulated. However, global models with conventional parameterizations are unable to simulate precipitation extremes from mesoscale convective systems over midlatitudes in summer [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>], and so the results from these models are not reliable for regions and times of year in which these systems are important.

  <a rid="Equ1" ref-type="" href="#Equ1">1</a>) with the precipitation efficiency

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>•, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>]. The thermodynamic contribution in these simulations is close to what would be expected from scaling of precipitation extremes with surface specific humidity, and this implies a lower rate of increase than scaling with column water vapor [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. In the extratropics, the simulated rate of increase of precipitation extremes is close to the thermodynamic contribution at all latitudes, and there is little dynamical contribution from changes in vertical velocities [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" href="#CR61">61</a>•]. A stronger dynamical contribution resembling a poleward shift has been found in idealized aquaplanet simulations [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. This equation is the simplest equation for the vertical velocity that accounts for dynamical balance, and it is used here to gain some insight into the controls on large-scale vertical velocities in the extratropics, although it is not expected to be quantitatively accurate. In a strong non-convective event with saturated ascent, 
  <span class="italic">J</span> will be dominated by latent heating and 
  <span class="italic">σ</span> + 
  <span class="italic">κJ</span>/(

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>]. For a region of upward motion that is sufficiently broad in the horizontal with small moist static stability, Eq. (

  </div>, and the effect of climate change on the vertical velocity 
  <span class="italic">ω</span> does not depend on changes in static stability or latent heating. The vertical velocity still depends on RHS, but changes in this would be expected to be relatively small given modest changes in eddy kinetic energy [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and eddy length [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Equation (
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>) gives, therefore, some insight as to why the vertical velocities associated with large-scale extratropical precipitation extremes might not change greatly under climate change. The term proportional to

  <sub arrange="stack">0</sub>
  <span arrange="stack" class="sup">2</span> on the left hand side of Eq. (
  <a rid="Equ2" ref-type="" href="#Equ2">2</a>) arises from planetary rotation, and it makes the large-scale vertical velocity much less sensitive to deviations from a moist adiabatic stratification when compared to small-scale convective updrafts (see the “
  <a rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec3">Theory</a>” and “
  <a rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec9">Duration of Precipitation Extremes</a>” sections). We next turn to the tropics where the dynamical influence of planetary rotation is weaker and where convection is always a key factor for precipitation extremes.
