<p class="p">Here, Slnλ is the community composition change rate, expressed as the average of changes in population growth rate for the dominant species in a community, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> is the number of species counted in the analysis and lnλ
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">i</sub> is the population growth rate of the
