  <a rid="pone.0126228.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</a>), while in BCI, they showed different trends over time. In BCI, the annual average temperature increased while the annual average precipitation decreased from 1981 to 2005 (
  <a rid="pone.0126228.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0126228.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</a>). The rate of increasing temperature in BCI was greater than that in DBR. When we compared the trend of annual average temperature at the two sites across a similar period (1981–2005), we found that the annual average temperature of both DBR and BCI showed a similar upward trend.

   <p>Temperature data were unavailable for a few months in the years 1983, 1986, 1987 and 1988 for BCI. There are 5 intervals for community I of DBR (1955–1963, 1963–1967, 1967–1978, 1978–1982, and 1982–1985), two intervals for community II of DBR (1978–1982 and 1982–1985) and 5 intervals for BCI (1981–1985, 1985–1990, 1990–1995, 1995–2000, and 2000–2005).</p>
