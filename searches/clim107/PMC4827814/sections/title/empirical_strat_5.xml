 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the randomized nature of our study, the basic empirical strategy is straightforward: we compare the beliefs of respondents who were and were not exposed to the treatment. To increase efficiency, we also control for respondent characteristics. Specifically, we estimate the following equation, using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The variable 
  <span class="italic">Belief</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> is the reported belief of respondent 
  <span class="italic">i</span> about some aspect of climate change, such as whether or not it is caused by humans. We use the indicator 
  <span class="italic">Treat</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> to denote treated individuals and the indicator 
  <span class="italic">SoftInfo</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> to denote those who were in the soft information group. Finally, because controlling for covariates even in an experimental setting can improve the precision of the estimates [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref019">19</a>], our empirical model includes

   <span class="italic">X</span>
  </span>
  <sub>
   <span class="bold">
    <span class="italic">i</span>
   </span>
  </sub>—a vector of respondent characteristics, including age, age squared, gender, as well as sets of race, income, employment, education, and ideology indicators.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> is the difference in the average outcome between the treated and control groups, conditional on respondent characteristics. Similarly, 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> measures the difference between the beliefs of the soft information group and the control. Testing whether 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> = 
  <span class="italic">θ</span> reveals whether the effect of information is coming from its content or is simply due to the fact that subjects were told that a scientific consensus exists without additional evidence.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine treatment heterogeneity, we interact the treatment indicator with respondent characteristics, such as their ideology, education, and the degree to which they trust scientists. The last measure was elicited before the treatment and thus should not be affected by it.</p>
