  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The responses of the control group about scientists’ views on climate change reveal that the public underestimates the degree of scientific consensus, as measured by the survey of scientists we use to provide information to the treated group [
   <a rid="pone.0151469.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref001">1</a>]. In particular, respondents in the control group believe that only 72% of scientists agree that global warming is a process that is already underway (different from 95%, the percentage of scientists agreeing with the same statement, at 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), that only 69% of scientists believe that human activities are accelerating global warming (different from 88% at 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001), and that 32% of scientists would say that there is no need for immediate policy decisions (different from 9% at 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also find a great degree of skepticism toward the information shown to the HI treatment group. Almost two-thirds (65%) of the treated group did not think the information from the scientist survey was accurately representing the views of all scientists who were knowledgeable about climate change. Only about 20% of the skeptical respondents thought that participating scientists misstated their true views. The skepticism largely stems from the concern that the scientists polled (“US scientists who published in top journals”) were not representative of all scientists knowledgeable about climate change: 85% of skeptical respondents chose that as one of the reasons for thinking that the information was inaccurate. Being unemployed, liberal or conservative (versus moderate) were the only significant predictors of not trusting the information from the survey of US climate scientists.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Those in the treatment group who were skeptical of the information also believed that scientists were less certain about climate change than the control group (by about 4 percentage points, on average). On the other hand, the control group did not think that there would be significant differences in the answers by the following two groups of scientists: (a) all scientists knowledgeable about climate change, and (b) only US scientists who published in top journals. The fact that the treated respondents reported that (b) would not be representative of (a) while the control group does not expect there to be significant differences between them suggests that some people in our sample may suffer from “self-justification” bias. “Self-justification” refers to the phenomenon of justifying one’s behavior or beliefs when facing evidence that is inconsistent with them [
   <a rid="pone.0151469.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref020">20</a>]. For example, in our case, the self-justification bias may explain why some respondents continue to believe that climate change is not caused by humans when facing the fact that most scientists believe that it is. Self-justification bias may also be responsible for the disconnect described above: one way to justify continuing to believe that climate change is not occurring or is not caused by humans in light of the scientific consensus information is to claim that the survey does not accurately reflect all scientists’ views. Alternatively, it may be that learning about US climate scientists’ views on climate change caused some of the treated respondents to rationally conclude that these scientists’ views differ from the views of all scientists knowledgeable about climate change.

On the other hand, there is no difference between the treated and control group in terms of the probability that temperatures

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t002" href="#pone.0151469.t002">Table 2</a> investigates whether the effect of information on beliefs translates into policy preferences or actions. Column (1) estimates the effect on information on the belief that “there is enough scientific uncertainty about the rate and extent of global warming and climate change that there is no need for immediate policy decisions”. We find no significant treatment effect. This is consistent with a model where people look to climate scientists for objective scientific information but not public policy recommendations, which also require economic (i.e. cost-benefit) and ethical considerations. The point estimates of the effect of information on the willingness to donate some of the potential winnings (Column 2) and on the donation amount (Column 3) are positive, but not significant. We find a significant difference between the hard information treatment and the soft information treatment, however. In fact, vague information seems to decrease donations. This finding is consistent with previous work by [

However, the standard errors are large and we are unable to reject that the three coefficients are significantly different from one another. Columns 2, 4, and 5 suggest that information most strongly affects moderates’ beliefs about humans causing climate change and about the probability of temperature increases, although once again, we are unable to reject that the three ideological groups respond to information in an identical manner. Beliefs about policy actions are not significantly affected by information for any of the ideological groups (Column 3). Finally, treated conservatives donate marginally more to climate change causes, although we fail to reject that the point estimates for the three groups are equal (Column 6).

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t004" href="#pone.0151469.t004">Table 4</a> decomposes the effect of information by educational attainment. In our survey, educational attainment is broken up into 8 categories, ranging from less than high school to doctoral degrees (PhD) and professional degrees (MD, JD, DDS, etc.). For the purpose of this analysis, however, we combine the categories into two bins: some college or 2-year degree and below (low education) and 4-year college degree and above (high education). We find that receiving hard information significantly impacts the highly educated in terms of increasing their beliefs about climate change being already underway, beliefs that there would be an increase in temperature by more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050, and the amount donated to climate change causes (Columns 1, 5, and 6). On the other, the low education treatment group is more likely to believe that climate change has been caused by human activities (Column 2). However, once again, in all cases, we cannot reject that the high and the low education groups respond to the treatment in the same way.

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t005" href="#pone.0151469.t005">Table 5</a> breaks down the effect of information by prior knowledge about climate science. We measure this knowledge by the number of correct answers to questions about climate science, such as being able to name greenhouse gases (see detailed survey in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0151469.s004" href="#pone.0151469.s004">S4 Text</a>). The high knowledge group answered more than two questions correctly, while the low knowledge group answered 2 or fewer questions. Overall, the precision of our estimates does not allow us to statistically distinguish between the two groups. We find that both high and low knowledge respondents are positively affect by information in terms of their beliefs about climate change being underway (Column 1) and the probability that global temperature will rise by more than 5 degree Fahrenheit by 2050 (Column 5). The beliefs that climate change is caused by humans and that temperature would rise by more than 2.5 degree Fahrenheit by 2050 are significantly increased for the treated low knowledge respondents (Columns 2 and 4), although the coefficients for the high knowledge group are not significantly different.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 6-month follow-up survey allows us to gauge whether the short-run effects persist over time. In the follow-up, we ask the same questions about beliefs about climate change as we do in the baseline survey, but do not re-administer the treatment. Tables 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" href="#pone.0151469.t006">6</a> and 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t007" href="#pone.0151469.t007">7</a> summarize the results. Although the point estimates on the hard information treatment indicator are positive, we no longer find a significant effect of information, except for the probability that temperatures increase or decrease by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit or more (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" href="#pone.0151469.t006">Table 6</a>, Columns 3 and 6). At the same time, the standard errors are large, so that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the treatment effects are persistent. Because only roughly half of the original respondents completed the follow-up survey, our small sample size may mask the existence of a long-run effect (or lack thereof).

   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" href="#pone.0151469.t006">Table 6</a>), we would need about 2,600 observations in total (1,300 treated and 1,300 control) to have an 80% chance of rejecting a null hypothesis of no treatment effect with 95% confidence. For the beliefs about whether humans are causing climate change (Column 2 of 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151469.t006" href="#pone.0151469.t006">Table 6</a>), we would need about 5,200 individuals to do so. If these two long-run estimates were significant, they would show that about 50–55% of the original effect of the “hard information” treatment persists for at least six months. Given the magnitude of these estimates, the simplicity of the treatment (i.e., each treated respondent read only one paragraph), and the relative lack of research about whether or not information treatment effects persist, obtaining a larger sample size to see whether the long-run effects are indeed significant should be a fruitful area for future research.
