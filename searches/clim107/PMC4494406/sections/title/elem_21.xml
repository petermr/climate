 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While it is clear that animal welfare concerns for many different climate change mitigation strategies exist, fortunately a great many more potential solutions have benign or even beneficial welfare outcomes. Many of these options are strategies for extensive production, systems that, if improved, have very high welfare potential. Basic improvements to these systems would also have the co-benefit of improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. With more attention paid to the health, physiology, and behavioral effects on animals at the outset, triple-win strategies can be championed that mitigate climate change, improve food security, and improve animal welfare.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Improved Animal Health and Longevity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where climate change solutions and improved animal welfare may dovetail best begins with a focus on the animals. Improving the efficiency of animal production systems by improving animal health and reducing mortality could reduce CH
   <sub>4</sub> and N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions considerably by reducing losses due to health related production declines and emissions attributed to animals that die before they can reproduce or produce consumable products. In locations where basic veterinary care, vaccinations, clean drinking water, shade, husbandry skills, technical knowledge, financial aid and other vital resources are lacking, there is great potential for improvement. For example, in many developing African and Asian countries, approximately 80% of poultry is still located in village flocks [
   <a rid="B161-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B161-animals-05-00361">161</a>]. Globally, backyard flocks kept for meat and eggs contribute 42.5 million tons of CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq. in greenhouse gas emissions and have higher emission intensity than intensively confined chickens, due in part to the low feed quality of scavenging birds and the toll that disease and predation take on productivity [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. Vaccinations, providing simple, low-cost protection for newly hatched chicks from predators, supplementary feeding of balanced rations, and basic biosecurity education [
   <a rid="B162-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B162-animals-05-00361">162</a>] could simultaneously improve the welfare of the flocks, alleviate poverty, and potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The climate change mitigation potential of these improvements has not specifically been studied, to our knowledge.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extending dairy cow lifetime is another potential improvement. Cows can easily live to 15 years of age or longer, but on most intensive, indoor dairy production facilities that typify developed countries the lifespan of a cow is typically closer to six years [
   <a rid="B163-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B163-animals-05-00361">163</a>]. A USDA summary reports the proportion of dairy cows permanently removed from the herd for reproductive problems was 26.3%; 23.0% were removed for udder or mastitis problems, 16.0% for lameness or injury, and 16.1% for poor production [
   <a rid="B52-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-animals-05-00361">52</a>]. Similar factors for culling are reported for Canada and European countries [
   <a rid="B163-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B163-animals-05-00361">163</a>]. In one study of 14 Irish dairy herds, the rate at which cows were replaced in the herd increased from 16% in 1990 to 27% in 2003, an increase of 0.8% per year, and the proportion of cows culled for infertility increased 2.2% per year, from 27% in 1990 to 40% in 2002 [
   <a rid="B164-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B164-animals-05-00361">164</a>]. Improved longevity would reduce the total lifetime emissions of dairy cows when accounting for the resources needed for rearing replacement heifers. The proportion of total methane emissions produced by replacement heifers has been estimated to be up to 27% for U.K. dairy herds [
   <a rid="B165-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B165-animals-05-00361">165</a>]. Relative to the period from birth to first calving (a period that usually lasts from 25 months to about 3 years, depending on the region), a greater number of lactation periods per lifetime will reduce overall CH
   <sub>4</sub> loss per unit of milk yield [
   <a rid="B166-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B166-animals-05-00361">166</a>]. By improving the lifespan of a dairy cow from 3.02 to 3.5 lactations, methane emissions would be reduced by 3% [
   <a rid="B167-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-animals-05-00361">167</a>]. Selection for increased productive life could also lead to a decrease in disease incidence of dairy cows [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, one possibility for addressing the lack of individual attention on industrialized farms could be “Precision Livestock farming” (PLF). In PLF, sensors continuously monitor key indicators, such as animal movement, feed intake, or temperature and alert caretakers when a problem arises. Examples include using cameras to monitor the behavior of hens, pedometers to monitor estrus behavior of dairy cows, and automated scales for measuring weight gain of chickens [
   <a rid="B169-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B169-animals-05-00361">169</a>]. PLF has good potential for automated detection of animal health problems. For example, auditory sensors can be used to detect disease in fattening pigs by analysis of coughing sounds, which change qualitatively when the respiratory system is infected [
   <a rid="B170-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B170-animals-05-00361">170</a>,
   <a rid="B171-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B171-animals-05-00361">171</a>]. However, it is uncertain how applicable these highly technical solutions would be in developing countries, and there is a danger of losing genuine husbandry skills and knowledge when relying even more heavily on automation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2. Improved Animal Nutrition</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed previously, changes to animal diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase animal productivity, but they can also risk harming animal welfare. However, bolstering nutrition by supplementing poor diets or using improved forages can both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve welfare at the same time. In regions of the world with a seasonally dry tropical climate, such as Africa, the low nutritional value of most animal feeds during the dry season is a major constraint on animal productivity [
   <a rid="B172-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172-animals-05-00361">172</a>]. In developing countries, ruminant animals are often fed on low quality grasses and crop residues (stover). Inadequate nutrition is a key factor limiting fertility [
   <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>]. A large potential to mitigate emissions exists in these low-yield systems. For example, modeling of small ruminant production in West Africa suggests that improvements in forage digestibility, along with other animal health and husbandry measures, can potentially reduce emissions by 27% to 41% of baseline emissions, amounting to 7.7 to 12 million tons of CO
   <sub>2</sub>-eq. [
   <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improved forages can be used as a climate change mitigation strategy in both developing and developed regions. Legumes available for grazing ruminants in the United States include clover, alfalfa, crown vetch, and birdsfoot trefoil (lotus). These nutritionally valuable, high protein forages can be incorporated into established pasture or rangeland with interseeding. Not only can improved pastures reduce CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions from animals, but carbon sequestration in grassland soils can also be increased by planting nitrogen-fixing legumes [
   <a rid="B173-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B173-animals-05-00361">173</a>,
   <a rid="B174-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-animals-05-00361">174</a>,
   <a rid="B175-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-animals-05-00361">175</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mitigation potential of feeding legumes has been the subject of a substantial number of studies. Simulation results in one study showed that CH
   <sub>4</sub> production is 28% lower with legume forage (alfalfa hay) as compared to grass (timothy hay) when expressed as a proportion of gross energy (GE) intake, and 21% lower when expressed relative to digestible energy (DE) [
   <a rid="B176-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176-animals-05-00361">176</a>]. These results are corroborated by multiple field studies, which also find lower CH
   <sub>4</sub> with pasture legumes for sheep [
   <a rid="B177-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-animals-05-00361">177</a>] and cattle [
   <a rid="B178-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-animals-05-00361">178</a>,
   <a rid="B179-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179-animals-05-00361">179</a>]. For example, Waghorn 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2002) found that when fed to sheep, a sulla/lucerne feed mixture produced just 19.0 g CH
   <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI compared to fresh pasture, which produced 25.7 g CH
   <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI. In a second trial, lotus produced just 11.5 g CH
   <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI, and by using polyethylene glycol binding to remove condensed tannins (CT), the researchers demonstrated that CT played an important role in this reduction [
   <a rid="B177-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-animals-05-00361">177</a>]. Condensed tannins not only lower CH
   <sub>4</sub> production in sheep, but may also have other beneficial effects including improving wool growth and reducing intestinal worm burdens [
   <a rid="B180-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B180-animals-05-00361">180</a>]. However, at least one study failed to find reduced methane production feeding white clover to sheep (Hammond 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011) [
   <a rid="B181-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B181-animals-05-00361">181</a>], and so more study is required.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One caution: legume consumption in some cases is associated with animal health issues, such as fetal hydrops in periparturient ewes [
   <a rid="B182-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B182-animals-05-00361">182</a>], and bloat with some tropical legumes [
   <a rid="B183-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183-animals-05-00361">183</a>]. Feeding legumes must, therefore, be carefully managed to avoid animal health problems.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many other feeding management strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions without compromising animal welfare could be better emphasized and further explored. These include improving silage quality with more effective preservation methods [
