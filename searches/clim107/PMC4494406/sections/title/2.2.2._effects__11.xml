 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increases in the productivity of swine, largely achieved through genetic selection, have been cited as climate change mitigation progress [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>] (p. 100–101). For example, a 2013 FAO report cited data provided by the US National Pork Board. Between 1959 and 2009, there was a 29% increase in the number of hogs marketed in the United States, yet the size of the breeding herd has been reduced by 39%. This is due in part to the steady increase in litter size from 7.10 in 1974 to 9.97 piglets in 2011 and the concomitant change in the amount of pork produced from a single breeding animal from 775 to 1828 kg. Feed efficiency also increased by 33%. This has reduced the carbon footprint per 454 kg of hot dressed carcass weight produced by 35% [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>,
  <a rid="B45-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-animals-05-00361">45</a>]. However, the original source for this calculation [
  <a rid="B64-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-animals-05-00361">64</a>] does not appear to be peer-reviewed, and total emissions in the US pork industry have increased overall with greater pork production. Despite this, the suggestion is that the type of throughput achieved in the United States, if adopted more widely in the developing world, could be an approach to climate change mitigation. However, some of the key unintended animal welfare consequences that may accompany such a change include low piglet viability and severe feed deprivation of breeding sows in order to prevent them from becoming obese.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selectively breeding for increased litter size reduces the proportion of surviving piglets [
  <a rid="B65-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-animals-05-00361">65</a>,
  <a rid="B66-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-animals-05-00361">66</a>]. Herpin 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> (1993) postulated that genetic changes have altered body fat metabolism, body composition, and hormonal state, resulting in lean tissue growth that makes piglets heavier but less mature at birth compared to lines that have not been so intensely selected for production traits. This reduces piglet survival rate [
  <a rid="B67-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-animals-05-00361">67</a>], which is an intractable problem in the pork industry. Selection for leanness may have also inadvertently decreased the nutritional quality of sows’ milk [
  <a rid="B68-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-animals-05-00361">68</a>], in turn further affecting survival of the piglets.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selectively bred for productivity, growing/finishing pigs in the United States are fed to satiety to meet their full genetic potential, but breeding animals must often be feed restricted to prevent excessive weight gain and fat deposition. Confined sows are typically fed just half the amount they would choose to consume if fed 
  <span class="italic">ad libitum</span>. This leads to a chronic hunger problem including persistent, unfulfilled feeding motivation [
  <a rid="B69-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B69-animals-05-00361">69</a>,

  <a rid="B71-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71-animals-05-00361">71</a>]. Short feeding times and lack of an outlet for natural foraging behavior are underlying causes of abnormal stereotypic behavior, discussed below in
