<p class="p">Monogastrics have improved GHG efficiencies compared to cattle. Cattle accounted for 77% of total non-CO

 <xref rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. This biological difference can be explained by three main factors: greater feed efficiency, lower enteric CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, and faster rates of reproduction. CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from ruminants originate from both manure and enteric fermentation, while CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from monogastrics are primarily associated with manure alone. Because sows and hens have a relatively large number of progeny and earlier sexual maturity, the number of breeding adults per animal slaughtered for human food is reduced in these production systems [
 <xref rid="B137-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. Together, these factors account for the reduction in inputs and lower emissions of pig and poultry production worldwide.
