 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the gaps identified in Canadian health adaptation, we suggest several steps to advance on adaptation in a health context: 
  <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Development of a national adaptation research consortium, or further regional consortiums. A national or regional research consortium would serve to coordinate research activities and act as a boundary organization to link research and policy [
     <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-00623">18</a>], as Ouranos does for Quebec and the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) does for Australia. Development of Ouranos in the province of Quebec has helped to characterize and quantify the impacts of climate change on human health in Quebec and provide a solid knowledge base for subsequent Action Plans [
     <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-00623">76</a>]. Similarly, the Australian government established the NCCARF to coordinate and manage climate change adaptation research. Evaluations of NCCARF have found that the Facility’s activities have improved Australia’s capacity to develop the knowledge necessary for effective adaptation decision-making [

   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Development of provincial and territorial vulnerability assessments to guide sub-national health adaptation. Before making an adaptation plan and implementing adaptation actions, the first steps in adapting to climate change are understanding current and future climate vulnerability [
     <a rid="B96-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-ijerph-12-00623">96</a>]. Sub-national governments will be able to make informed adaptation decisions that are context-appropriate and an efficient use of resources with access to detailed vulnerability assessments.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Development of adaptation guides for regional health authorities, similar to the series of extreme heat events guidebooks developed by Health Canada [
     <a rid="B66-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-12-00623">66</a>,
     <a rid="B67-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67-ijerph-12-00623">67</a>,
     <a rid="B68-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B68-ijerph-12-00623">68</a>]. Developing an adaptation guide could serve as a tool for regional health authorities to identify the necessary steps and considerations for adaptation. Some of the health effects of climate change will be felt locally, thus regional health authorities (or equivalent) must make adaptation to climate change a priority [

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Regular meetings of representatives from all sectors involved in federal, provincial and territorial health adaptation in Canada. Such meetings are important for coordinating activities, and working towards a more comprehensive national health adaptation strategy [

    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Regular meetings between provinces and territories, and between municipalities and regional health authorities, to exchange knowledge and experience, such as in Switzerland where cantons are encouraged to exchange procedures and experiences during heat waves [

    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <p>Ensuring adaptation best practices such as consideration of vulnerable groups and monitoring and evaluation are being followed in future adaptation programming, guided by existing adaptation best-practice guides such as UKCIP’s Adaptation Wizard [
