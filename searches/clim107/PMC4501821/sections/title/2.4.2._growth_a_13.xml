 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input data required to predict future forest states with JABOWA-3 includes (i) climatic information, (ii) initial stand conditions, and (iii) site conditions, including soil information. Projected future climate data (climate change) were acquired from Environment Canada [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref039">39</a>]. The information related to site conditions was extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and GIS thematic maps of NS, while soil-related information was acquired from the Canadian Soil Information Service (CANSIS) [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref040">40</a>]. Initial stand conditions were based on PSP records. Tree growth projections were developed for 34 PSP locations across NS, selected to represent nine eco-regions and capture the diverse climatic and site growing conditions of NS. The model was first calibrated using historical weather records and observed PSP data from NS [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref041">41</a>]. JABOWA-3 was initiated with existing stand conditions using relevant projected future climates. The model was run 5–7 times for each location to lessen the effect of model stochasticity inherent in model functions of mortality and ingrowth. Individual-tree diameter and height dynamics for the next 90 years were extracted from JABOWA-3 outputs under three projected climate-change scenarios.
