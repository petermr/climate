 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artificial intelligence technology was employed in this study. This growing technology has a potential to solve complex problems in simulation studies. The technology was used to develop a simple G&amp;Y model for prediction under conditions of changing climate by integrating historical tree records and data from an ecological process-based model. Historical tree records were extracted from provincial PSP datasets of the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources (NS DNR). A process-based gap model (i.e., JABOWA-3) was used to project tree growth under three climate-change scenarios [

This model simulates tree growth based on key assumptions: i.e. (1) trees grow at a maximum rate under optimal conditions, which is influenced by maximum tree age, diameter, and height; (2) tree growth is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors such as inter-tree competition, temperature, and soil water and nutrient content. JABOWA-3’s detailed climate-related functions make it a useful tool in the study of tree species response to climate change. JABOWA-3 had been previously used for climate-change impact assessments of forests in NS [

Historical and projected tree growth data were both designated as target quantities (“observations”) and employed in the construction and validation of independent sub-models of diameter- and height-increment. The sub-models were designed to predict individual-tree basal area (BA) and volume increments. Diameter increment was modeled as BA increment (expressed in cm
  <span class="sup">2</span> 5year
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) and height increment as volume-increment (m
  <span class="sup">3</span> 5year
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). Tree BA was calculated using standard BA-diameter relations, while volume estimates were based on Honer
