 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mediterranean ecosystems may be able to endure moderate climate warming without major changes in plant–pollinator interactions, at least as long as the plant communities are not overly water stressed. Additional water stress due to decreased rainfall predicted by climate change scenarios could, however, induce stronger and more rapid changes in nectar production and plant–pollinator interactions. More extensive changes in Mediterranean communities can be expected towards the end of the century due to more extreme warming, when even species adapted to the severe conditions of open phrygana, such as 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, might be excessively stressed by the elevated temperatures. Consequent changes in plant–pollinator interactions can include weakening or disruption of interaction networks and can eventually lead to a possible loss of pollinator species in the Mediterranean systems (
