  </a>). One aspect of plant–pollinator interactions, which is particularly sensitive to climate change, is nectar production by plants (
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Plants have an optimum range of temperatures for nectar production, determined by their habitat and species characteristics (
  <a rid="PLV111C19" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C19">Jakobsen and Kristjánsson 1994</a>). Often a moderate increase in average temperature can have a positive effect on plant nectar production (

  <a rid="PLV111C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C25">Nocentini 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013
  </a>) but beyond that plants experience temperature stress, which can induce changes in nectar production (

  </a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). A number of studies from different systems have found decreased nectar volumes and nectar production rates at higher temperatures under both experimental and natural conditions (

  <a rid="PLV111C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C20">Keasar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2008
  </a>). At the same time, nectar sugar concentration is usually less dependent on external factors and more constant throughout the day and the flowering season (
  <a rid="PLV111C43" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C43">Southwick 1983</a>;

  <a rid="PLV111C25" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C25">Nocentini 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013
  </a>). The amount of sugar produced per flower has nevertheless been shown to depend on nectar volume rather than concentration (

  <a rid="PLV111C17" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C17">Hoover 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012
  </a>) and thus can be strongly affected by changes in ambient temperatures.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A decrease in nectar quantity and sugar content in response to global warming reduces the amount of resources available for pollinators and thus can have negative effects on plant–pollinator interactions (
  <a rid="PLV111C14" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C14">Hegland

  </a>; 
  <a rid="PLV111C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C39">Scaven and Rafferty 2013</a>). Under temperature stress plants can even begin to produce flowers without any nectar (
  <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>), which further reduces the amount of resources. A decrease in floral rewards, but also in the variation of nectar production patterns within a plant, can change pollinator behaviour patterns (

  <a rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C49">Zimmerman 1988</a>). Most often, pollinators are found to be risk-sensitive to greater variability of nectar volume (

  <a rid="PLV111C20" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C20">Keasar 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2008
  </a>) and high variation can therefore decrease plant attractiveness to pollinators (
  <a rid="PLV111C49" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C49">Zimmerman 1988</a>). Consequently, climate change can reduce plant reproductive success due to changed interaction patterns with pollinators and possibly threaten the persistence of both plant and pollinator populations (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mediterranean Basin is considered to be one of Europe's regions most threatened by climate change, due to the elevated drought risk during summer (

  <a rid="PLV111C16" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C16">Hickler 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012
  </a>), caused by elevated temperatures in combination with decreased precipitation during summer (

  <a rid="PLV111C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C18">IPCC 2013</a>). Different climate scenarios predict 4–5 °C warming for summer months by the end of the century, relative to the end of the 20th century (

  <a rid="PLV111C18" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C18">IPCC 2013</a>). These changes in temperature and precipitation regime can generate increasingly severe conditions for plant communities and consequently increase the vulnerability of mutualistic interaction networks in the Mediterranean region. In the water-limited phryganic communities (East-Mediterranean low scrub), the nectar production is generally low, with only a few species producing large quantities (i.e. &gt;0.5 µL) of nectar per flower (
  <a rid="PLV111C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C30">Petanidou and Smets 1995</a>). In these systems, Lamiaceae are a dominant plant group constituting the main source of water and nutrients for pollinators (

  <a rid="PLV111C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C29">Petanidou 2007</a>). Their role is particularly vital during summer, when nectar production in this system is challenged by high ambient temperatures, whereas nectar-feeding insect diversity is high (

  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we explore the effect of temperature on the nectar production of two common phryganic species of Lamiaceae visited predominantly by bees, both honeybees and wild bees. In both a climate-controlled and natural setting, we study the patterns of flower and nectar production and their variation in response to a wide range of temperatures, including temperatures higher than current climatic means, thus allowing us to investigate the potential effects of climate change on nectar rewards available to pollinators in the future. Our hypothesis is that strongly elevated temperatures reduce flower and nectar production and affect the variation in nectar production patterns. Such results could indicate a possible threat to pollinators and to the persistence of both plant and pollinator populations in the Mediterranean systems. It may also affect negatively bee-keeping and honey production, which play an important role in the economy of this area.</p>
