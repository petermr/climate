 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our two study species responded to the elevated temperatures somewhat differently, which suggests possible disparate responses to climate change in phryganic species. For one, 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> optimal temperatures for nectar and sugar production were in general lower, close to the current average temperatures, and the species therefore more sensitive to climate warming than 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span>, which had higher optimal temperatures for nectar secretion (Figs 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F1" href="#PLV111F1">1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" href="#PLV111F2">2</a>). Additionally, several traits of 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> exhibited dependence on elevated temperatures (nectar volume per flower, sugar content per flower and number of flowers per plant) in addition to the effect of time through the flowering period. On the other hand, in 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> it was only nectar volume per flower that clearly depended on elevated temperatures. Strong dependence on temperature implies that 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> could be rather sensitive to temperature changes, whereas 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> might be more moderately affected by climate warming.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in species' nectar production patterns could be caused by the plants' adaptations to the different phryganic microhabitats, which the two species inhabit—
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> prefers modified or somewhat protected microhabitats (understorey, partially shaded, neighbouring to different structures), while 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> grows under full sun (

  <a rid="PLV111C34" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C34">Petanidou 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2000
  </a>). As a plant of open natural areas, 
  <span class="italic">T. divaricatum</span> is adapted to particularly high temperatures and does not experience physiological stress at moderately higher than average temperatures, akin to other open phryganic species, such as 
  <span class="italic">Thymus capitatus</span>, which has a similarly high optimal temperature range for nectar sugar production (
  <a rid="PLV111C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#PLV111C31">Petanidou and Smets 1996</a>). At the same time, 
  <span class="italic">B. acetabulosa</span> as a plant of less exposed habitats could be less adapted to the heat and considerably more sensitive to temperature rise. This difference suggests a stronger effect of climate change on understorey plants in the phryganic systems, which are less adapted to high temperatures and the effect of drought. At the same time, species that are adapted to the harsh conditions of the open phrygana might be able to cope better with the forthcoming changes.
