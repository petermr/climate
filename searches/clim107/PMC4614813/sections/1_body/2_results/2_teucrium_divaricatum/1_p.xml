<p class="p">All tested traits of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic>, except sugar concentration per flower, were significantly positively unimodally related to temperature in combination with time in the climate chamber (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>). Nectar volume and flower sugar content per flower of 
 <italic class="italic">T. divaricatum</italic> peaked at higher average temperatures (∼29–33 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>A and C) than the number of flowers per plant produced per day (∼24–25 °C; Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>E). Sugar content per plant was therefore greatest at ∼26–27 °C (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PLV111F2" class="xref">2</xref>D). Trait variation (CV) of flower traits was not related to elevated temperatures in most of the studied traits, except CV of sugar concentration [

 </bold>]. In the outdoor group, only two traits showed a significant relationship to average temperature; the number of flowers per plant decreased with increasing temperatures and biomass per flower was positively unimodally related to temperature (Table 
 <xref rid="PLV111TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Most of the outdoor models also had very low marginal coefficients of determination (
