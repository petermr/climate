 <p>The negative effect of climate change on plants and plant–pollinator interactions is a matter of concern worldwide. The Mediterranean region is considered particularly susceptible to climate warming and the communities of this region will need to face considerable climatic changes over the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. We studied the effect of temperature on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean species (
  <span class="italic">Ballota acetabulosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Teucrium divaricatum</span>) to evaluate their potential responses to climate change and a consequent effect on their pollinators. Both species would handle moderate warming relatively well but would be negatively affected by strong warming predicted for the end of this century.
