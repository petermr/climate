 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The logistic model is made of the cumulated number of freeze/thaw events with a threshold of 3°C (FrThw3:NbCum) along with the same variable squared. It has often been mentioned that freeze-thaw cycles (with a 0°C threshold) are necessary to induce sap flow for sugar maple. The threshold of 3°C obtained here may indicate that fluctuations around a given temperature close to 0°C are sufficient for sap flow to occur. However, the 3°C threshold is the one measured at the meteorological stations disseminated within each region. It is possible that the sugar maple stands under study may be located at higher elevation and that they were exposed to temperature variations closer to 0°C than 3°C. The model also includes the cumulated number of growing degree-days starting on Julian Day 1 using a 5°C threshold (GDDCum). This latter variable has a negative effect on the number of weeks with maple syrup production. Its role in the model is likely for predicting the end of the production period when too much heat has been accumulated by the maple stands. Overall, the model was successful at classifying weeks in the proper bin (production or not). The global model accurately predicted 83% of the production weeks and 95% of the non-production weeks (data not shown).</p>
