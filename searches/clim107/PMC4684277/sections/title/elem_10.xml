 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average day (Julian day) when the production of syrup started for the reference period ranged from 65 (VAL and STY) to 83 (BSL) between regions (
  <a rid="pone.0144844.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0144844.g002">Fig 2</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0144844.t001">Table 1</a>). A similar range was also observed for the end of the production with average Julian days of 101 and 116 for the same regions, respectively. The average temperature for the period of January to April (T
  <sub>J-A</sub>), that ranged from -3.7 (VAL) to -7.3°C (BSL), was a strong predictor of the start and end date (not shown) for each region (
  <a rid="pone.0144844.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0144844.g003">Fig 3</a>). Although such a relationship may appear likely, this is the first time the temperature sensitivity (corresponding to the slope of the relationship shown on 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0144844.g003">Fig 3</a>) of the “phenology” of maple syrup production is quantified. Based on the latter equation, the onset of syrup production is expected to advance by about four days for each degree of warming. This value is in good agreement with reported values of changes in the date of flowering and leafing for many plant species that fall within 2.5 to 5 days for a warming of 1°C [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref024">24</a>]. Clearly, such a model based on average temperature cannot be used to predict the day at which the season will start for a given year but it can be used to predict the long term changes in the onset of the maple syrup production using only scenarios of annual temperature (see below).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the fact that the period of observations is not long in terms of absolute number of years (n = 13 years), the data set included strong between years and between regions variability in terms of weather and timing of maple syrup production. Weekly data for the years 2010 and 2008, the years with the earliest and the latest production periods, respectively, showed a 4–5 week difference in the timing of peak syrup production (data not shown). On a regional and yearly basis, the earliest date of onset of syrup production, Julian day 53, was observed in the STY region in 2010 while the latest (Julian day 104) was observed in LAU in 2003 (
  <a rid="pone.0144844.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0144844.t001">Table 1</a>). Ends of the production period showed similar variability with the earliest and latest ends of production being observed on Julian day 87 (VAL, 2000) and 139 (LAU, 2003), respectively. Given that when the production starts later it normally ends later, the average length of the production season was much less variable than start and end dates (
