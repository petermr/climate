 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ground-level ozone (O
  <sub>3</sub>) is one of the major air pollutants discussed in terms of climate change. Some refer to O
  <sub>3</sub> in terms of “the good, the bad, and the ugly,” says Megan L. Melamed, executive officer of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project. The ozone layer located in the stratosphere, which protects human life from harmful ultraviolet radiation, is the “good.” Ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub>, with its myriad adverse health effects, is the “bad.” O
  <sub>3</sub> also acts a short-lived climate pollutant, contributing to the greenhouse effect—the “ugly.”
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although higher temperatures are associated with elevated ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub>,
  <a rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" href="#r2">
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </a> ozone events require sunlight. Overall, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts, warmer temperatures and increased water vapor abundance will reduce baseline concentrations of ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub>—a positive development, given the health harm this pollutant can do.
  <a rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" href="#r3">
   <span class="sup">3</span>
  </a> But other factors are likely to intensify O
  <sub>3</sub> production in polluted areas, especially during heat waves and drought.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O
  <sub>3</sub> is created by chemical reactions between ultraviolet radiation and precursor air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen (NO
  <sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These precursors come from anthropogenic sources such as automobile emissions, gasoline vapors, and power plants. They also come from natural sources, including vegetation (in the case of VOCs) and lightning (in the case of NO
  <sub>x</sub>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The smell of O
  <sub>3</sub> is familiar to many city dwellers during the dog days of summer. The summer air seems to thicken when a high-pressure weather system stalls over a city, baking streets in blazing temperatures under cloudless skies. Winds die down, and hot city air is trapped under a dome of high pressure (or “heat dome”), concentrating pollutants near the ground in what’s called a stagnation event. These conditions are ideal for producing ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ground-level O
  <sub>3</sub> can be formed anywhere in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, which ranges from the surface up to elevations around 10–15 km, depending on latitude and season. O
  <sub>3</sub> is also formed in the lower stratosphere, the next higher level of the atmosphere, up to elevations around 50 km.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cities can have lower levels of O
  <sub>3</sub> than one might expect, based on the amount of precursors produced by urban sources. Interaction with traffic-related NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions transforms a portion of urban O
  <sub>3</sub> to O
  <sub>2</sub>, the most stable form of oxygen. Furthermore, once a stagnation event ends and winds resume, large concentrations of urban O
  <sub>3</sub> and precursor pollutants can be transported into surrounding rural areas hundreds of miles downwind. O
  <sub>3</sub> concentrations therefore tend to peak downwind of major cities, not in them.
