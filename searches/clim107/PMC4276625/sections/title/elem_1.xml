  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.1. Survey Instrument</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey instrument was developed to assess physicians’ experiences with climate change, particularly whether they were witnessing health effects in their own patients. The instrument also included nonclinical questions on climate change beliefs and policy preferences that were drawn from earlier surveys with members of the general public [
   <a rid="B7-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-11-12473">7</a>,
   <a rid="B8-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-11-12473">8</a>]. The questions regarding clinical observations were developed by the research team and piloted with clinicians from the two partnering organizations as well as other medical societies that are interested in conducting similar assessments amongst their own members. The 15 to 20 min survey included a total of 65 questions, including open-ended questions that invited respondents to provide clinical anecdotes about their patients, barriers they face to discussions about climate and health with patients, and additional resources they would find useful. As described below, the survey was initially administered via paper and pencil, and subsequently online. A complete list of survey questions can be downloaded from the Mason 4C website [
   <a rid="B9-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-11-12473">9</a>]. The survey was approved by Mason’s Institutional Review Board (Project 563778-1/2).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey was conducted in March and May of 2014. Paper surveys were completed by the attendees of the 16th NMA National Colloquium on African American Health, which is a policy conference attended by national, state, and local NMA leaders, as well as a few leaders of other health and civic organizations, held in March of 2014. Subsequently, in May 2014, other members of NMA were emailed an online version of the survey.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The paper surveys were distributed during a session of the Colloquium. The survey was introduced by a member of the NMA, outlining the importance of gaining physicians’ perspectives on climate change and health. Respondents were entered into a raffle to win an iPad mini. These respondents were presented with the preliminary findings of the survey at a subsequent session of the Colloquium, two days later.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second round of surveys was distributed via email in an online format. Initially, an emailed letter of request was sent to all NMA members with emails on record who had attended the previous year’s NMA Annual Convention and had agreed to receive emails from the NMA; a link to the online survey was embedded in that request. Three reminders, over the course of two weeks, were sent to members of the sample who had not yet responded. To encourage participation, several participation incentives were offered on a lottery basis: a 2015 NMA membership; a free hotel stay for the upcoming Annual Convention; and two department store gift certificates. For individuals who previously had taken the survey at the National Colloquium, there was an option on the consent page that took them immediately to the end of the survey, so they would not take the survey a second time.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before taking the survey, participants were told the purpose of the study was to assess their attitudes about how climate change is related to health. For the initial survey administration, this information was announced by an NMA member and included in the informed consent. For the online survey, this information was included in the letter of request and part of the informed consent.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Descriptive statistics were run on all variables, using unweighted data. The data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. All mean differences reported are deemed significant if 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 in a two-way test. Confidence intervals (CI’s) were calculated using an online CI calculator [
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-11-12473" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-11-12473">10</a>]. Based on the sample size, the approximate confidence intervals for any survey question was ± 5.8%, therefore any response items that differ less than 8.5% (the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences) should not be considered statistically different. Data was not weighted, but responses were segmented by region and were not statistically different from each other when calculated using ANOVA. No regions of the U.S. (Northeast, South, Mid-West, Southwest, and Pacific Northwest) or coastal location (states on a coastline 
   <span class="italic">vs.</span> landlocked states) differed significantly from the overall national responses. Open-ended comments were edited for minor grammar and spelling corrections, and some comments that did not directly address the question were removed from this report; personally identifying information included in responses is also not reported.
