  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g003" href="#pone.0136092.g003">Fig 3</a> shows a shift in happiness for all climate tweets collected in the 6 year period, we now move to analyzing specific climate change-related time periods and events that correspond to spikes or dips in happiness. It is important to note that tweets including the word “climate” represent a very small fraction of unfiltered tweets (see gray squares comparing text sizes in bottom right of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g003" href="#pone.0136092.g003">Fig 3</a>). While our analysis may capture specific events pertaining to climate change, it may not capture everything, as Twitter may contain background noise that we can’t easily analyze.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g002" href="#pone.0136092.g002">Fig 2</a>. The word shift graphs use unfiltered tweets as the reference text and climate tweets as the comparison text for the date given in each title.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g004" href="#pone.0136092.g004">Fig 4(a)</a> shows that climate tweets were happier than unfiltered tweets on December 28, 2008. This is due in part to a decrease in the word “no”, and an increase in the words “united”, “play”, and “hopes”. On this day, there were “high hopes” for the U.S. response to climate change. An example tweet by OneWorld News is given in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g005" href="#pone.0136092.g005">Fig 5(a)</a> [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g004" href="#pone.0136092.g004">Fig 4(b)</a> shows that climate tweets were happier than unfiltered tweets on April 9, 2009, largely due to the increase in positive words “book”, “energy”, and “prize”. Twitter users were discussing the release of a new book called 
  <span class="italic">Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air</span> by David JC MacKay [
  <a rid="pone.0136092.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136092.ref030">30</a>]. Also on this date, users were posting about a Climate Prize given to a solar-powered cooker in a contest for green ideas. Example tweets include 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g005" href="#pone.0136092.g005">Fig 5(b) and 5(c)</a> [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0136092.g004" href="#pone.0136092.g004">Fig 4(c)</a> shows that climate tweets were happier than unfiltered tweets on April 30, 2012. This is due to the increased usage of the words “dear”, “new”, “protect”, “forest”, “save”, and “please”. On this date, Twitter users were reaching out to Brazilian president Dilma to save the Amazon rainforest, e.g.,

Topics of conversation in tweets containing “climate” include the threat posed by climate change to a tropical species, a British climate bill, and the U.S. economic crisis. Example tweets include

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This per day analysis of tweets containing “climate” shows that many of the important issues pertaining to climate change appear on Twitter, and demonstrate different levels of happiness based on the events that are unfolding. In the following section, we investigate specific climate change events that may exhibit a peak or a dip in happiness. First, we analyze the climate change discussion during several natural disasters that may have raised awareness of some of the consequences of climate change. Then, we analyze a non-weather related event pertaining to climate change.</p>
