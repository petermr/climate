 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2. Indicator Selection and Toolkit Development</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resilience refers to the “capability of individuals and systems to cope with significant adversity or stress in ways that are effective and that tend to result in an increased ability to constructively respond to future adversity” [
  <a rid="B29-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-11-13097">29</a>]. Based upon this definition, indicators were identified to capture key climate change resiliency metrics to describe actions to prepare for, cope with and constructively respond to extreme weather events and gradual shifts in average weather conditions. Best practices identified from the literature review helped inform selection of the indicators used to develop the assessment checklist. Indicators were categorized into two general groups that included emergency management and strengthening health care services and climate-proofing and greening operations (referring to measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce waste and improve the health of the environment).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Emergency management indicators to evaluate and assess the status of health care services and emergency management were further grouped based on the key exposures and health outcomes expected to pose increasing risks to the operation of, or populations served by these facilities [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-11-13097">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-11-13097">31</a>]. Effectively addressing the health risks of climate change requires preparations for critical emergencies and for events that extend in duration (e.g., drought, disease outbreaks). The indicators for emergency management and strengthening health care services are comprehensive and capture requirements for health care facilities to prepare for and respond to a range of situations that may result from climate change and increase health risks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indicators were assessed by an expert advisory committee and used to develop the resiliency assessment checklist for health care facilities. Members of the advisory committee included emergency management and facilities management officials from select hospitals in Canada, and representatives from the Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care, the United Kingdom’s National Health Services Environmental Sustainability Branch, the Departments of Environment and of Health and Wellness in Nova Scotia. The final set of indicators used to develop the assessment checklist in the toolkit is presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-11-13097-t001" href="#ijerph-11-13097-t001">Table 1</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The checklist was designed for use by health care officials within the health care setting to obtain data on the status of current activities that convey resilience to current climate variability and on activities that help prepare for future climate change impacts. Once completed, it provides information that can be mainstreamed into regular planning and program decision making. Each indicator in the table was used to develop one or more corresponding questions in the assessment checklist. For most questions, response options included “Yes”, “No”, “Somewhat, Sometimes”, “I don’t know” or “Not Applicable”. The first iteration of the toolkit consisted of a two page backgrounder and a list of 92 checklist questions organized into three areas including Emergency Management (n = 45 questions), Facilities Management (n = 26 questions) and Health Care Services and Supply Chain Management (n = 21 questions). </p>
