 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most infrastructure was built under the assumption that the weather in the next few decades will be similar to the weather today. As a result, some critical infrastructure, such as health care facilities are located in flood plains and along coastal regions that are at risk of inundation [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-11-13097">40</a>]. As such, health care facilities may need to take steps to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change. Robust facility structural elements (e.g., roofs, doors, windows) and non-structural components (e.g., computers, diagnostic equipment, HVAC systems, back-up generators) need to be able to withstand extreme weather events that may cause acute or gradual damage, and/or may need to be moved above possible floodwaters. Regular maintenance, prioritizing replacement of old equipment and use of new and emerging technologies to mitigate the effects of such events can reduce vulnerability [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-11-13097">50</a>]. For example, health care facilities in drought prone regions that may be vulnerable to future water shortages can install storm water collection systems, design landscapes with drought resistant native plants, and conserve water by using appropriate low flow taps, nozzles and toilets. Health care facilities can increase their resiliency to extreme heat events by installing devices and equipment for monitoring indoor temperatures, cooling existing buildings and outdoor spaces, blocking direct sun, and increasing air flow and reducing humidity [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-11-13097">39</a>,
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-11-13097">50</a>]. In addition, encouraging sustainability practices, such as turning off equipment when not in use, has shown to be a cost effective [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy supply systems in many communities are vulnerable to more frequent and severe extreme weather events and other pressures such as increased demand from population growth. Back-up power sources and strategies to deal with long lasting electricity disruptions will better prepare health care facilities for emergencies and disasters. In addition to disrupting patient care, power-outages can affect patient identification and records, access to clinical care, the demand for services, communication systems, and transportation to and from the health care facilities [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>,
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-11-13097">16</a>] and increase risks of infectious diseases [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-11-13097">51</a>]. Back-up generators should be tested and protected to ensure they are functional in an extreme weather event [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-11-13097">35</a>] and use of combined heat and power systems as a replacement for back-up generators should be evaluated. In cases where power is limited during disruptions, electricity should be re-directed to clinical areas to meet needs of vulnerable patients [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-11-13097">14</a>]. Plans and protocols for managing outcomes of power-outages, such as mandatory evacuation, should be developed, reviewed, and tested regularly to ensure that effective measures are in place to continue to provide high quality health care when electricity is limited.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greening initiatives which invest in energy efficient solutions can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce health care facility costs and vulnerability to power disruptions [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-11-13097">52</a>,
  <a rid="B53-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53-ijerph-11-13097">53</a>]. Health care facilities can improve energy efficiency and save energy costs by using low energy lighting, boilers and electrical systems, increasing reliance on natural ventilation, promoting active transportation and the use of energy efficient vehicles, providing distant counseling services and using green procurement (e.g., purchasing local food) [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-11-13097">5</a>,

  <a rid="B54-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-11-13097">54</a>]. E-health, which includes electronic methods of information exchange among health care professionals and patients (e.g., use of email delivery of diagnostic results), can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from patient commuters; however, backup plans should be developed to address unreliable power or energy supplies [
  <a rid="B55-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B55-ijerph-11-13097">55</a>]. Greening health care facility properties (e.g., planting trees, grass and gardens) offers multiple health co-benefits such as the provision of natural shade for patients, staff and visitors during extreme heat events, reduced risk of facility flooding through the creation of natural flood water infiltration and the improvement of air quality by filtering pollutants [
  <a rid="B28-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-11-13097">28</a>]. Installation of high performance windows and exceeding minimum insulation requirements can also improve energy efficiency and enhance the comfort and safety of patients during extreme temperature events [
