 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robust emergency management and health care strengthening programs that include measures to prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from extreme weather events or public health emergencies increase resilience to climate change [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-11-13097">31</a>,

  <a rid="B34-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-11-13097">34</a>]. Standard emergency management approaches, such as all-hazards programs need to be modified to incorporate observed and projected alterations in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events to increase preparedness [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-11-13097">32</a>]. Managing risks from climate change (such as extreme weather) requires health care facilities to regularly undertake risk assessments that integrate current climate variability and future climate change [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>] to support effective forward planning [
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-11-13097">31</a>,
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-11-13097">35</a>]. In regions found to be vulnerable to climate hazards such as floods or storm surges, adaptation efforts to increase the safety of buildings and protection of critical equipment can increase resilience [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>] as can efforts to prepare for patient surges and associated pressures. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To anticipate increased health care demands and prepare accordingly, information on climate change and health vulnerabilities at the community level can be used [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-11-13097">2</a>]. In many urban communities in Canada, climate change will contribute to poor air quality (e.g., from wildfire smoke, smog, allergens) that can lead to increased hospital cases of asthma, COPD, acute bronchitis, chest pain and other cardio-respiratory illnesses [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-11-13097">3</a>,
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-11-13097">36</a>]. Early warning systems can help increase preparedness to support the delivery of care. Health care facilities can benefit by being linked to weather alert and warning systems [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-11-13097">37</a>] such as heat alert and response systems (HARS) [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-11-13097">34</a>]; air quality alerts [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-11-13097">38</a>]; boiled water advisories and critical service disruption notifications to better anticipate increases in hospital visits. Many communities in Canada have adopted HARS to notify vulnerable groups, the general public and health care and community services of impending extreme heat events and to provide information on how people can protect themselves from heat-health impacts [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-11-13097">39</a>]. Such systems can help health care facilities be more prepared for increased heat-related hospital visits.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing mortality from heatwaves and other extreme weather events, changes in the geographic range and incidence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, increasing morbidity and mortality from poor air quality and other health impacts will require modification of current public health programs and training of health care providers to be prepared for patients presenting with currently unexpected climate-sensitive health outcomes [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-11-13097">40</a>]. As such, training programs could be enhanced to ensure adequate protection and care of patients with specialized needs (e.g., infants and children) [
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-11-13097">41</a>]. Furthermore, information on range expansion of specific diseases acquired through national and regional assessments can be used to inform rapid testing, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of diseases to protect health [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-11-13097">24</a>]. Climate-induced range expansion of the deer tick that harbors Lyme disease is occurring rapidly in Canada [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-11-13097">42</a>,
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-11-13097">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-11-13097">44</a>] and warmer weather and more precipitation events may increase the abundance of mosquito species that carry West Nile Virus [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once health care facilities have a better understanding of risks in their area, officials can create new or enhance existing protocols to improve risk management. For example, health care facilities in areas vulnerable to extreme heat should develop plans and protocols to guide actions that need to be taken during an extreme heat event (see

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Logisticians should be cognizant that more extreme weather events can increase risks of flooding at supply warehouses, damage to storage facilities, and disruption of communication lines and transportation [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-11-13097">25</a>] and therefore diversify suppliers and develop plans accordingly. Emergency preparedness programs could also enhance contingency plans for timely delivery of medical supplies and establish mutual aid agreements with other health care facilities to be resilient in emergencies where resources are limited [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-11-13097">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Efforts to support community resilience to climate change should be implemented in addition to regular health care facility risk management processes. Some communities are undertaking climate change and health vulnerability assessments [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-11-13097">47</a>]; health care facility officials can participate in these efforts to support the identification of community level vulnerabilities and contribute to better estimates of health system adaptive capacity. Health care facilities also could participate in disaster risk management exercises to promote coordination and collaboration during a real event. Real time reporting of climate-sensitive health outcomes can help public health agencies take action to prevent public health emergencies [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-11-13097">48</a>,
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-11-13097">49</a>]. Syndromic surveillance of health outcomes attributable to extreme heat or other climate hazards using hospital visits or other health information systems (e.g., health help lines, clinician visits) can support public health programs such as monitoring and providing early warning of impacts, informing and improving the public health response to climate hazards. It also provides a source of morbidity data to use in the process of continually assessing, evaluating and improving health programs [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-11-13097">18</a>,
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-11-13097">49</a>]. As one example, the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control is involved in efforts to link health care facility syndromic surveillance with air quality issues from wildfire smoke and extreme heat events. The system will better equip public health officials with information needed to target key vulnerable groups.
