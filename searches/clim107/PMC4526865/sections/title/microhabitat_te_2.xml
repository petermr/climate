 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Intertidal microhabitat temperatures were recorded at 15 exposed to moderately exposed shores along the European Atlantic coast, spanning nearly 20° of latitude, from Southwest Scotland to South Portugal (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>, A – South Cairn, B – Emlagh, C – Holyhead, D – Annascaul, E – Wembury, F – Landunvez, G – Batz-sur-Mer, H – Royan, I – Biarritz, J – Prellezo, K – La Caridad, L – Cabo Touriñan, M – Moledo, N – São Lourenço, O – Evaristo). Data were acquired using robolimpets (autonomous temperature sensing/logging devices mimicking the visual aspect and temperature trajectories of real limpets, see Lima and Wethey
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a> for details). Loggers were deployed following Seabra

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. Temperatures were sampled from 6 distinct combinations of height above the low water mark (low, mid and high shore) and exposure to sun (shaded and sun-exposed), thus covering most of the spectrum of microhabitats occupied by intertidal species. Data were collected continuously between the summers of 2010 and 2014, at a sampling rate of 60 minutes and a resolution of 0.5 °C. For each microhabitat, logged temperatures were averaged whenever data from multiple sensors were available. All data manipulation and analyses were done using R 3.1.2
