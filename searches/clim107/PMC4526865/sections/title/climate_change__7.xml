 <div class="title">Climate change can generate complex biogeographic responses.</div>
 <p>Conceptual framework (
  <span class="bold">a–c</span>) and example built using real temperature data (
  <span class="bold">d–f</span>) illustrating the mechanism through which climate change may induce complex biogeographic responses. Black dots show the abundance of a hypothetical species in each location (A–O, see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), which results from the interplay of ‘winter minimum’ (blue areas) and ‘summer 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile’ (dark orange areas). Light orange results from the overlap between blue and orange areas and shows the outcome of the Liebig’s law of the minimum. (
  <span class="bold">a</span>,
  <span class="bold">d</span>) show the initial conditions, (
  <span class="bold">b</span>,
  <span class="bold">e</span>) result from the monotonic increase of both winter minimum and summer 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile (scenario of increased mean), and (
  <span class="bold">c</span>,
  <span class="bold">f</span>) from increase of one aspect of temperature and decrease of the other (scenario of increased variability but stable mean).
