    <p>The impacts of drought on infectious diseases which represent a substantial burden of illness in Canada already (e.g., 
     <span class="italic">C. perfringens</span>,

   <div class="list-item">
    <p>The impacts of drought on disease rates associated with fungi that are now established in Canada (e.g., 
     <span class="italic">Cryptococcus gattii</span> and
