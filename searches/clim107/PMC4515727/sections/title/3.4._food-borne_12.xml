 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The conditions associated with drought could impact food-borne illness. Hot and dry conditions often associated with drought are thought to favour the proliferation of some food-borne pathogens. The impact in Canada could be significant, as currently there are an estimated 11 million cases of food-borne illness annually across the country [
  <a rid="B105-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105-ijerph-12-08359">105</a>]. Among reportable diseases, 10,174 cases of 
  <span class="italic">campylobacteriosis</span> and 6,828 cases of salmonellosis were reported in Canada in 2012 [
  <a rid="B76-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-ijerph-12-08359">76</a>]. Illness caused by 
  <span class="italic">Clostridium perfringens</span> is not nationally notifiable in Canada, but ranks among the most common food-borne diseases in the industrialized world [
  <a rid="B106-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106-ijerph-12-08359">106</a>]; in the U.S., 
  <span class="italic">C. perfringens</span> is thought to cause close to one million cases of food-borne illness each year [
  <a rid="B107-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107-ijerph-12-08359">107</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In some cases the environmental conditions created by drought are favorable to pathogens, such as 
  <span class="italic">C. perfringens</span>, which does well in hot and dry conditions [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>]. 
  <span class="italic">Campylobacterios</span> is also expected to benefit from some seasonal conditions under climate change in the future [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>]. However, the expected impacts of climate change-related drought conditions remain uncertain for other pathogens, including 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Listeria</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Norovirus</span> [
  <a rid="B54-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54-ijerph-12-08359">54</a>]. For example, under experimental desiccation 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella (typhimurium)</span> lost infectivity and cultivability [
  <a rid="B108-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B108-ijerph-12-08359">108</a>]. Meanwhile, in contrast to earlier studies, Zhang 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B109-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-ijerph-12-08359">109</a>], in comparing models to forecast salmonellosis cases in Adelaide (Australia) found decreased rainfall was associated with salmonellosis cases. It is possible that this finding was due to interaction with other variables such as temperature or the unique local climate [
  <a rid="B109-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B109-ijerph-12-08359">109</a>]. For example, Ge 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B110-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B110-ijerph-12-08359">110</a>] suggest that under extreme conditions, including drought, when the soil contains high concentrations of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> there may be greater internalization of the pathogen in lettuce relative to optimal irrigation conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During drought, cultivated crops, fish and shellfish consumed for food [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>] may pose an increased risk of disease, which could have implications for human health [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>]. If treated municipal sewage is used by the agricultural sector for irrigation or to process products due to water shortages there can be an increase in the risk of food-borne illness (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>, 
  <span class="italic">E. coli</span>) [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>]. Local food production practices and food imported from some countries may need to be monitored more closely under such conditions [
