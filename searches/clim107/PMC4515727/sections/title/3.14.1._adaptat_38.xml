 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective adaptation to climate change-related impacts, including drought, requires “mainstreaming” in which climate change information is routinely considered and incorporated into existing programs, policies and planning [

  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. For example, in Ontario, de Loe and Berg [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>] point to opportunities to “mainstream” climate change into source water protection planning within the Clean Water Act to help address anticipated changes to water supply and demand, including an increased frequency of drought [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-08359">62</a>]. Mainstreaming can be assisted by integrating learnings about effective risk management options and adaptations from experiences with current climate variability, particularly extreme weather events. However, mainstreaming also requires consideration and use of information about risks expected from future climate change in adaptation planning. A range of measures to adapt to changes in water quality and quantity in the context of climate change, such as leak detection, outreach, adjustments to the building code and management policies have been reported in the province of Quebec [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many sectors will be affected by drought and play a role in adaptation to reduce risks to individuals and communities. In urban centers communities may adapt to drought by enhancing water delivery systems and through watershed management [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-12-08359">59</a>,

  <a rid="B204-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204-ijerph-12-08359">204</a>]. In Atlantic Canada, communities facing shortages or reduced water quality have made efforts to improve water treatment systems, conserve and protect surface water and develop new water sources through, for example, water capture [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>]. Dams, desalination and water recycling are also being used to cope with the increased variability in water supply, although the cost and impacts of such actions are not well established [
  <a rid="B204-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204-ijerph-12-08359">204</a>]. The health sector must actively be engaged in drought management at all levels of government. For example, in Brazil actions to protect public health are embedded into all stages of drought-related disaster risk reduction [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasing water use efficiency is advocated as an important adaptation when water infrastructure already exists [
  <a rid="B204-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204-ijerph-12-08359">204</a>]. Water conservation has also been highlighted as an important measure for easing drought-related costs [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-08359">50</a>,

  <a rid="B204-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B204-ijerph-12-08359">204</a>]. This may be done through voluntary or mandatory restrictions on water usage during vulnerable periods [
  <a rid="B43-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-12-08359">43</a>] or education campaigns to promote conservation [

  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>]. During the 1987–1988 drought in California (U.S.) education was used in conjunction with mandatory and voluntary water conservation programs to target a 10%–25% reduction in water use [
  <a rid="B265-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B265-ijerph-12-08359">265</a>]. As this drought stretched on, impacts spread from dryland agricultural areas to impacts on state level electrical power supply. Lessons learned in a study of this drought identified inadequacies in water resource planning, the existence of responsible agencies along political rather than affected area boundaries and a lack of inter-jurisdictional communication as key factors. Water shortages continue to occur in California despite national freshwater draws (per capita) having dropped below levels seen in 1975 [
  <a rid="B265-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B265-ijerph-12-08359">265</a>], with the exception of municipal and industrial use which are also expected to decline as regulations and technologies for more efficient use are adopted. In the most recent 2014 drought in California the entire state was under moderate to exceptional drought and water customers in Santa Cruz were required to decrease their water consumption by 25% with financial penalties for non-compliance [
