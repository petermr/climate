  <a rid="B273-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B273-ijerph-12-08359">273</a>]. The international literature also highlights the importance of drought forecasts and preparing for drought in advance [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, agricultural adaptation over the past century has included the development of new agricultural practices and infrastructure to conserve and enhance water supplies and distribution and targeted institutional activities to improve water management [

  <a rid="B275-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B275-ijerph-12-08359">275</a>]. For example, less frequent tilling and reductions of other field management practices that lowered soil moisture and increased erosion aided in lowering the vulnerability of farmers to the 2001–2002 drought relative to the drought of the 1930s [
  <a rid="B203-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B203-ijerph-12-08359">203</a>,
  <a rid="B275-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B275-ijerph-12-08359">275</a>]. Governments have also increased regional resilience by producing drought plans and enacting legislation to support coordinated water management. In England, water resource management plans have been incorporated into climate change adaptation plans [
  <a rid="B276-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B276-ijerph-12-08359">276</a>]. In the U.S., drought plans have been produced by a number of states [
  <a rid="B277-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B277-ijerph-12-08359">277</a>]. Water management and climate change adaptation plans are being developed by various watershed, municipal and regional authorities across Canada [

  <a rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B287-ijerph-12-08359">287</a>]. A media analysis of adaptations undertaken in Canada during the 2001–2002 drought showed that the most frequently mentioned actions included measures related to irrigation, conservation and the management of water resources, insurance and other financial assistance programs (e.g., Canadian Farm Income Program, Net Income Stabilization Account), as well as government based low water responses [
  <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>]. Irrigation in particular is one of the most broadly referenced agricultural adaptations to drought in the literature [
  <a rid="B289-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B289-ijerph-12-08359">289</a>]. The use of irrigation systems is increasing across Canada and irrigation is becoming more and more common in regions that had previously relied on rain and subsurface water (Saskatchewan has an Irrigation Strategy to grow and extend the use of irrigation across the province as part of their Water Security Plan 
  <span xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Irrigation-Strategy-2014" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Irrigation-Strategy-2014</span>; see also [
  <a rid="B335-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B335-ijerph-12-08359">335</a>]). In Prince Edward Island the growing reliance on irrigation in potato farming and requests for new deep well licenses created serious concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater supplies and whether or not a moratorium instituted over a decade earlier was still required [
  <a rid="B290-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B290-ijerph-12-08359">290</a>,
  <a rid="B291-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B291-ijerph-12-08359">291</a>]. In November, 2014, a decision was made to uphold the moratorium. In more arid regions where water supplies are finite, like the Okanagan region of southern British Columbia, water demands are managed through a combination of monitoring and management among users (e.g., managing water catchments, use of high elevation dams, reservoirs and instituting seasonal use restrictions). In Alberta’s Oldman Dam water shortages have even been managed using a system of “sharing the shortage” in which users agree to share the reduced allocation of water due to drought [
  <a rid="B292-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B292-ijerph-12-08359">292</a>]. In 2001, partial allotments of 60% were successfully used to ensure the delivery of water supplies to all licensees.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water consumption can also be reduced by managing the timing of irrigation so that it targets the sensitive stages of crop development. In the case of corn, for example, yield losses may be reduced significantly by preventing water deficits at critical times in development; notably during the reproductive stages [
  <a rid="B293-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B293-ijerph-12-08359">293</a>,
  <a rid="B294-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B294-ijerph-12-08359">294</a>]. Even when plants are subjected to drought conditions, the timing and duration of the event must also be considered since plant processes can often recover following a period of drought if critical management actions are taken at the correct time (e.g., irrigation during flowering). Water conservation strategies and the timing and use of water (water management and irrigation timing) represent simple solutions that can be managed in response to need, when and where required (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the farm scale). In contrast, technological and transgenic approaches will take time to develop [
  <a rid="B295-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B295-ijerph-12-08359">295</a>]. Moreover, since drought resistance is linked to overall plant performance, cultivars that are tolerant to extreme drought conditions may result in reduced production during less extreme or episodic drought conditions [

  <a rid="B298-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B298-ijerph-12-08359">298</a>]. As such, farmers may need to balance trade-offs between production and the risk of drought in their choice of what to plant next season. Planting seeds representing a diversity of cultivar tolerance may prove beneficial in this case [
  <a rid="B299-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B299-ijerph-12-08359">299</a>]. The combined use of existing drought tolerant cultivars with physiologically sensitive timing of irrigation can serve to reduce water demands during key stages of development. Furthermore, since drought stressed plants and livestock are also more vulnerable to diseases, competition from invasive species and pests, strategies that increase genetic and crop diversity across fields and the landscape may represent adaptations that will provide overall benefits to both health and production [

Looking to the future, against a global backdrop of diminishing lands suited to agriculture and multiple cropping due to climate change, Canada is expected to experience an increase in the area of land that is marginally or moderately suitable for agriculture in farther northern regions [
