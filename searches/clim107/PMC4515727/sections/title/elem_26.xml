 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Populations at higher risk to the health impacts of climate change have been identified in the literature. They include infants and children, elderly people, the socially and economically disadvantaged, pregnant women, people who spend time outdoors and those with chronic diseases and compromised immune systems (

Overlap exists between populations vulnerable to the health impacts of drought and populations at risk of adverse impacts on health resulting from other extreme weather events, including those expected to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-08359">46</a>,
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-12-08359">59</a>]. For example, people of low-socioeconomic status have more difficulty taking protective actions during extreme heat events [
  <a rid="B234-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B234-ijerph-12-08359">234</a>] and may also suffer greater impacts from drought [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-08359">49</a>]. As an important pathway for increased exposure to injuries, air pollution, food, water and vector-borne diseases as discussed above, drought is associated with many higher risk populations. The existence of common vulnerability factors to multiple climate-related vulnerabilities increases overall risk to public health, but also offers significant opportunities to take adaptive actions that convey benefits among a broad spectrum of risk areas, including drought. For example, Cheng and Berry [
  <a rid="B235-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B235-ijerph-12-08359">235</a>] identify efforts to enhance social capital as a climate change adaptation that has multiple health co-benefits.
