Record warm and dry conditions in British Columbia over the same summer and preceding winter also set the stage for a wildfire season that saw more than seven and a half times the 20 year average in land area burned in 2014 [
  <a rid="B167-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-ijerph-12-08359">167</a>]. Wildfires are expected to become more frequent and severe in many parts of Canada with climate change [

Further, drought has been associated with periods of extreme heat which can present a range of health impacts that need to be addressed. In addition to its direct impact on human health, extreme heat can add to drought-related stress on agriculture with knock-on effects discussed below. For example, an extreme heat event that took place in Russia over July and August, 2010 reduced the country’s grain yield by 25%, resulting in increases in food prices and losses estimated at $15 billion [
