  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vector-borne diseases—particularly mosquito-borne ones—are frequently associated with increased precipitation [
   <a rid="B111-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B111-ijerph-12-08359">111</a>] because standing water is needed for the development of immature stages of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are important disease vectors in Canada as they can transmit West Nile virus (WNV). There were 110 total clinical cases of West Nile virus reported in Canada between January and the end of November, 2013, including three cases potentially related to travel outside the province where they were reported [
   <a rid="B112-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B112-ijerph-12-08359">112</a>]. High precipitation in the prairie provinces in 2007 was thought responsible for an unprecedented abundance of 
   <span class="italic">Culex tarsalis</span> mosquitoes that in turn led, later that year, to the largest ever outbreak of WNV in Canada (2,401 cases) [

   <span class="italic">Cx. pipiens</span> and 
   <span class="italic">Cx. restuans</span>, which are the main WNV vectors in eastern Canada, also suggest that precipitation is positively associated with their abundance [
   <a rid="B115-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115-ijerph-12-08359">115</a>]. However, in some circumstances periods of drought have been directly associated with increased risk from mosquito-borne infections, such as WNV in southeastern, northeastern, central and western U.S., the Canadian prairies, as well as in Europe [

   <a rid="B122-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122-ijerph-12-08359">122</a>]. A number of explanations have been proposed for these observations, including impacts of drought on competitors and predators of WNV mosquito vectors [
   <a rid="B116-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B116-ijerph-12-08359">116</a>] which can lead to mosquito population increases [
   <a rid="B115-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B115-ijerph-12-08359">115</a>] and changes in communities and densities of the bird species that are reservoir hosts of WNV, resulting in increased WNV prevalence in mosquitoes [

   <a rid="B124-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B124-ijerph-12-08359">124</a>]. Semi-permanent rather than permanent wetlands are thought to be particularly prone to the effects of drought given the fluctuations they experience in response to precipitation. Irrigation during times of drought may create new breeding sites for WNV mosquito vectors and thus shift the local geographic focus of risk from WNV [
   <a rid="B125-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B125-ijerph-12-08359">125</a>]. In the matrix of mosquito breeding habitat found in urban and suburban environments, small numbers of locations can contribute to mosquito breeding and abundance and these are frequently man-made water courses, sewage overflow systems and holding pools, 
   <span class="italic">etc .</span> [
   <a rid="B126-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B126-ijerph-12-08359">126</a>], which are likely to continue to hold water during drought events. Associations of WNV incidence with droughts or low precipitation (e.g., in Virginia, U.S. [
   <a rid="B127-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B127-ijerph-12-08359">127</a>]) may be due to reduced flushing of mosquito larvae and eggs from breeding sites in urban areas during rainfall; this flushing reduces mosquito abundance [

   <a rid="B130-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B130-ijerph-12-08359">130</a>], but the relationships amongst mosquito abundance, infection prevalence, WNV risk and seasonal variations in drought and rainfall can be complex, geographically variable, habitat/environment-specific and difficult to predict [
   <a rid="B131-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B131-ijerph-12-08359">131</a>]. In addition to altering the mosquito vectors’ environment, drought can impact risk from mosquito-borne diseases by affecting contact rates between the vectors and reservoir hosts, thereby influencing the prevalence of infection in mosquitoes [

In California (U.S.) drought may have contributed to an increase in human WNV cases by reducing populations of non-competent host birds, allowing for greater contact of mosquitoes with reservoir-competent host birds and possibly humans [

Drought has a consistently negative effect on risk from tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease because of (i) direct killing of ticks by desiccation in severe drought; (ii) reduction in host-finding success by reducing the time that ticks can spend seeking hosts outside of moisture-holding refugia in the habitats in which they occur; and (iii) increased energy expenditure due to ticks returning more frequently to moisture-holding refugia to rehydrate [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of drought on zoonoses transmitted directly from wildlife to humans is likely a reduction in the abundance of wild animal hosts and consequently, reduced pathogen transmission. When drought is followed by rainfall, wild animal host densities may increase again, but as most individuals will be naïve of infection, the potential for epidemics exists. Rodent-borne hantavirus is a paradigm for this in which drought followed by heavy rainfall (particularly associated with El Nino) is thought to drive epidemics in the southwestern U.S. [
