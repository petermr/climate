  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.15.1. Knowledge of Current and Future Drought Impacts on Health</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years information about the potential health impacts of drought has increased. Evidence pointing to health impacts that may be modified by climate change has continued to build since earlier reviews (e.g., by Smoyer-Tomic [
   <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>] in 2004). The number of Canadian-U.S. studies is increasing, with more than half of the records for this region published after 2004. However, Canadian studies continue to be focused on the Prairies. In addition to studies situated within the Canadian context broadly, more than half of the records identified focused specifically on western Canada and all but one targeted the Prairies specifically. Research linking mental health impacts with wildfire and drought has also expanded significantly. However, research around drought and health remains narrow. Approximately three-quarters of the primary international studies identified were focused on mental health and nearly all focus on Australia. In the Canadian-U.S. literature, more than one-third of the primary studies are focused on mosquito-borne disease, largely WNV and the related SLE. This also appears to be the area of current interest, with these records accounting for more than half of the primary Canadian-U.S. studies published after 2004. Limited data on actual health outcomes results in uncertainty about the severity or magnitude of these impacts. Consequently projections of climate change effects on drought-related health impacts remain difficult to make especially in the Canadian context.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time that more evidence is needed to understand the impact of drought on health outcomes, public health is challenged by the uncertainty surrounding the probable occurrence of future drought in Canada. There has been limited research directed toward the probability and assessment of future droughts specifically over Canada in the context of climate change and variability. Greater certainty around the characteristics of drought anticipated in the future and their linkages with specific health impacts could help adaptation planners better identify and prepare for key risks in their regions, including those related to human health. For example, the literature reviewed in this paper suggests that certain features of drought (e.g., subsequent heavy rainfall events) may significantly increase risks of some infectious diseases among Canadians. Knowledge of geographic areas likely to be affected by drought, as well as potential changes to frequency, duration and severity of events is critical for the development of adaptation strategies which can directly or indirectly reduce health impacts. Coordinated drought research is limited and fragmented in Canada, often carried out only in response to severe drought experience. Although most regions of Canada have experienced drought, the majority of studies have focused on the Prairies due to the greater frequency of droughts in this region. The variety in the forms of drought experienced in Canada needs to be taken into consideration when planning for possible health impacts. Given the complex interactions with water, a discussion of the impact of drought on soil through the health lens may add to the literature on water and water content alone.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent 2013 systematic review of the effectiveness of public health interventions to reduce the health impacts of climate change highlighted a gap in the literature around adaptation to drought [
   <a rid="B310-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B310-ijerph-12-08359">310</a>]. While there has been some effort to assess agricultural adaptation to drought [
   <a rid="B311-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B311-ijerph-12-08359">311</a>] and public health promotion activities that touch on related impacts, such as spinal cord injury [
   <a rid="B250-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B250-ijerph-12-08359">250</a>,
   <a rid="B251-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B251-ijerph-12-08359">251</a>], none of the public health adaptations specific to drought identified in the international literature had been evaluated. Here, again, a lack of specificity around drought among other climate change-related extreme weather events limits the relevance of these discussions for public health planning.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential adaptations to directly or indirectly reduce health risks from drought are plentiful, particularly those that address agricultural impacts of climate change and weather variability. Few adaptations are discussed specifically in the context of drought but are often put forward to address secondary concerns (e.g., vector-borne diseases). Factors influencing agriculture and agricultural practices are complex and sometimes contradictory, ranging from public level issues driven by policy, legislation and international agreements, to environmental and community issues relating to how land is used and the local impacts [
   <a rid="B287-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B287-ijerph-12-08359">287</a>]. To a large extent adaptations to drought are emerging from regional risk and adaptation case studies [
   <a rid="B282-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B282-ijerph-12-08359">282</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is an opportunity to address multiple climate change-related health impacts under broad public health adaptations. In addition, adaptation activities and programs in other sectors can contribute co-benefits to the agricultural sector. Programs that have been developed for other objectives, such as protecting wildlife or water, have been found to provide incidental benefits to the agricultural sector during drought periods. Such co-benefits are not well recognized, but constitute just short of two-thirds of activities captured in a national inventory of programs for managing drought and agricultural water in Canada [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measures taken to adapt to drought between 2000 and 2006 over the Canadian Prairies were expensive, their effectiveness varied and challenges were associated with their implementation [
   <a rid="B199-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B199-ijerph-12-08359">199</a>]. Gaps in knowledge and misplaced assumptions have been identified as obstacles to drought adaptation. A number of barriers to agricultural adaptation to drought were highlighted during the drought of 2001–2002 in Canada, including the lack of research and a lack of funds, as well as problems relating to institutions and processes [
   <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>]. A study of water management systems in the North American Pacific Northwest found that water management decisions were centred around an assumption of stable conditions and this was compounded by a lack of access to regionally specific climate information [
   <a rid="B312-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B312-ijerph-12-08359">312</a>]. Challenges have also been noted in simply obtaining high quality local hydrologic information from climate change datasets [

   <a rid="B313-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B313-ijerph-12-08359">313</a>]. The paucity of such information makes it difficult for communities to develop more integrated climate adaptation plans which reduce drought risks.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Severe drought can exceed the adaptive capacity of agricultural producers and communities. In their analysis of the 2001–2002 Canadian drought, Wheaton 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B288-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B288-ijerph-12-08359">288</a>] found that some adaptations were ineffective and that drought brought about negative impacts even when adaptation measures were put in place. Drought can be a prolonged event, which also suggests the importance of considering both long-term and short-term adaptations and approaches to mitigate any long-term health impacts.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite rural areas having greater social capital than other parts of Canada [

Furthermore, the resources required to generate necessary information about future climate and weather conditions and the required analyses may not be available to provide timely planning direction to farmers, municipalities and other local planners [
