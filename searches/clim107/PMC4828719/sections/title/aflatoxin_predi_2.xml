 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model output, i.e., the AFI computed for maize and wheat, was summarised representing the 2254 grid points in Europe, 100 simulated years, and the three scenarios (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present scenario, for maize, mean AFI computed over all sites was 38, the percentage of sites with mean AFI &gt; 0 was 39%, but only in 20% of the sites mean AF contamination was predicted to be above the current legal limit in Europe (AFI &gt; 95). In the +2 °C and the +5 °C scenarios, mean AFI (over all sites) was 73 and 95, respectively. Mean AFI increased by 92% and 149% when moving from the present scenario to the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively, and 39% and 54% of the sites with AFI &gt; 95.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maps were drawn using geo-referenced grid points to highlight the predicted future aflatoxin contamination in Europe based on predicted AFI (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). In the present scenario, the area with possible aflatoxin production in maize (AFI &gt; 0) is mainly below the 45° North latitude, because of the limiting conditions for 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth and aflatoxin production at higher latitudes. Increasing temperature clearly enlarges the area of interest for maize. In the +5 °C scenario, maize farming is predicted in latitudes as high as 60° North, a much more northern geographic distribution than the current maize growing area. In both climate change scenarios, the most concerned areas with an increase of aflatoxin contamination were: Eastern Europe, Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean regions. However, the highest mean AFI values were found under the +2 °C scenario, frequently in the range of 160–200. Aflatoxin contamination above the legal limit are expected to become more frequent in the future, based on our results. This prediction is further confirmed by results shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, presenting the minimum and maximum probabilities of aflatoxin contamination in the 100 simulated years in the +2 °C scenario. The south of Europe has a high chance of becoming a risk area for aflatoxin contamination in maize, even in the least conducive year (i.e. with the lowest AFI value). Under the +2 °C scenario, the growing area of maize is expected to be almost the same as in the present scenario and an advance in flowering and harvesting dates is limited to 5 and 10 days, respectively (See 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary material</a> for details). Therefore, in this context, the agricultural management practices are not expected to change significantly, which makes predictions, obtained using only weather data as input, even more robust. The reliability of results is further supported by the confirmed accuracy of model predictions, irrespective of extreme weather conditions, and its sensitivity to data input, especially temperature.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding wheat, in the present scenario, mean AFI was 0.7. According to the model predictions, over 90% of the sites may allow 
  <span class="italic">A. flavus</span> growth (AFI &gt; 0), although with very low AFI values. Mean AFI increased by 60% and more than doubled in the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>), but the probability of aflatoxin contamination in wheat is so low that it can be considered irrelevant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When AFI &gt; 5 is considered, only 1% of the sites have a contamination above this threshold in the present scenario, increased to 3.5% and 4.4% in the +2 °C and +5 °C scenarios, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>). For all three scenarios, an increase in the mean AFI was found in several areas, but mainly in central Italy, Eastern Europe and close to the Baltic Sea, always with low probabilities of contamination. This confirms findings reported so far

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considering variation between years, the lowest and the highest means of AFI computed for maize are, respectively, 0.5 and 0.9 for the present scenario, 0.83 and 1.49 for the +2 °C scenario, and 1.03 and 2.06 for the +5 °C scenario. Therefore, a decrease of around 20% and an increase of around 34% with respect to the means were determined in the least and most conducive year, respectively. The variation between years is comparable in the +2 °C scenario, with −22% and +38%, and in the +5 °C scenario (−28% and +43%).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on this modelling approach to predict future aflatoxin contamination in maize grown in Europe, the +2 °C climate change scenario
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, currently considered the most reliable for the next 100 years
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, resulted into a significant increase in the estimated aflatoxin contamination in all maize growing areas, whereas the predicted impact on contamination in wheat was negligible.
