 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each scenario (present, +2 °C and +5 °C), AFI values, computed for 100 years, were grouped for each grid point (2254 grid points) and basic statistics (average, standard deviation and standard error) were calculated for each grid point.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean risk indices were presented as a spatial risk distribution for maize and wheat for each of the three scenarios. The iterations with the highest and the lowest risk prediction were also drawn.</p>
