 <div class="title">Risk maps for aflatoxin contamination in wheat at harvest in the +2 °C climate scenario.</div>
 <p>Mean daily data used as input result from 100-year run of the predictive model AFLA-maize in 2254 geo-referenced points throughout Europe. The least (a) and the most (b) conducive years were represented. The scale 0–200 refers to the aflatoxin risk index (AFI), output from the predictive model; increasing the number, the risk of contamination increases. Maps generated using Mathworks, Matlab.
