  <span class="italic">Climate-endangered</span> species (21.4%) are projected to lose more than half of current climatic range by 2050 without the potential to make up losses with gains in new areas. The climate-endangered group clearly faces the highest risk of extinction or extirpation from climate change. Current management prescriptions often focus on site-level resilience or helping species track their shifting climate niche [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref045">45</a>]. Neither action seems likely to help species with shrinking geographic ranges. For example, high elevation and high latitude species groups are often thought to face the problem of shrinking geographic ranges without expansion potential [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref005">5</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref009">9</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref046">46</a>]. Conservation of these shrinking range species requires the identification of areas within their current range that will remain climatically suitable into the future. In addition, since many 
  <span class="italic">climate-endangered</span> birds are not currently on any conservation priority list, there is no formal monitoring or legal protection for these most at risk species. For example, Baird’s Sparrow (
  <span class="italic">Ammodramus bairdii</span>) is projected to lose more than 95% of current range, yet is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although listed as a priority species in some states (e.g., Wyoming; [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref047">47</a>]), it is not in others (e.g. Colorado; [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref048">48</a>]). We suggest that the 126 species in this category be considered by conservation entities for immediate monitoring beyond existing programs such as BBS and CBC.

  <span class="italic">Climate-threatened</span> species (32%) are projected to lose more than half of current climatic range by 2080, but show potential to make up losses in new areas. With climatic ranges shifting through geographic space, these species will depend on natural or assisted movement to new locations. Shifting ranges are a familiar concept for managers. Our assessment identifies which species are potential shifters (i.e., 
  <span class="italic">climate threatened</span>) and, when coupled with 10 × 10 km species-level maps (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135350.s001">S1</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0135350.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0135350.s007">S7</a> Appendices), where this shifting is most likely to occur. This directs conservation attention to places most suitable under future climate conditions. However, even if species are able to perfectly track their climatic niches, many may suffer due to shifts in other ecological realities (e.g., competition, predation) relating to changes in the overall community. Note that it is also possible for shifting species to benefit from new interactions (e.g., exploiting new food sources or novel interactions leading to a competitive advantage for nesting).

  <span class="italic">Climate stable</span> species (46.6%) are defined as species projected to maintain more than half of current climatic range across all scenarios and timeframes. Many stable species also have the potential for dramatic expansion (
  <a rid="pone.0135350.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0135350.g002">Fig 2biii and 2c</a>) in addition to core range stability. This category is of lower conservation concern when thinking about climatic stability of geographic range. However, a climatically stable species could still be at risk from traditional conservation threats (e.g., habitat loss), and indirect effects of climate change that we were unable to model. For example, a rocky intertidal species could be climate stable but still experience significant threats from sea level rise, shifts in prey base, or competitors/predators shifting under climate disruption. In addition, our assessment may underestimate risks for Neotropical migrants because we were unable to model their responses to climate change on wintering grounds in Central and South America. Thus, a Neotropical migrant categorized as 
  <span class="italic">climate stable</span> based on the breeding season in North America may be more vulnerable than predicted if its range in the non-breeding season is strongly impacted. Future work needs to be done to better understand climate change impacts across the life cycle, and impacts on demographic processes not covered in this study [
