 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historical climate data were obtained from the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) and linked to historical bird observations using a point extraction tool that provided spatially continuous estimates of climate across the landscape [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref023">23</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref024">24</a>]. By using the mid-point of each CBC circle and the start-point of each BBS route as extraction points we ensured the distance between climate estimates and bird observations never exceeded 24 km. This approach seemed reasonable given the structure of the data sets, the continental scale of the study, inherent uncertainty in historical climate estimates, and the lack of systematic bias in the association of climate estimates and bird observations (even when small spatial mismatches may have occurred). We matched bird data and climate data on an annual basis, assuming that climate variables from the year leading up to each survey would best inform our understanding of occurrence data. We used 17 bioclimatic variables to characterize conditions in each year.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bioclimatic variables are thought to represent biologically meaningful combinations of monthly climate variables because they aggregate climate information in ways known to drive biological processes [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref025">25</a>]. Bioclimatic variables can be highly correlated, however, which raises concerns about the ability of modeling algorithms to identify causal relationships in data sets and to generate accurate predictions [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref026">26</a>]. A variety of approaches to clustering or removing predictors can be employed in an effort to reduce collinearity but none of them guarantee better inference or prediction [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref026">26</a>]. Ultimately, iterative assessment of correlated variables through observation and experiment is needed. We chose not to remove variables from our data set because we had little or no 
  <span class="italic">a priori</span> justification for choosing one correlated variable over another. In addition, our approach to matching bird data and climate data on an annual basis (described below) allowed correlations to vary across time and space, thus reducing the degree of collinearity.
