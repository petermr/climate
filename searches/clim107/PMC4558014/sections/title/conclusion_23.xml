 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the level of future emissions has a statistically significant effect on projected changes in species range sizes, even the most optimistic scenario generates major shifts in species ranges. Thus, while recognizing the importance of mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must also promote adaptation efforts to ameliorate the effects of climate change on bird populations. The long-term persistence of many bird species threatened by climate change will depend on their ability to colonize new areas made suitable due to climate change and the conservation management of areas that are presently suitable and will remain so into the future. Monitoring of species’ responses and projected climate risk, coupled with adaptive management of their populations, is likely the most effective way to deal the inherent uncertainty of climate responses. This approach creates a rigorous science framework in which continuous assessment can be linked to conservation investment. We suggest that agencies and NGOs adopt such an approach to dealing with climate change in relation to birds (and other organisms), considering species’ responses to both the loss of current range and future range potential.</p>
