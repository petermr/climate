 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change refers to relatively stable changes in the meteorological parameters like precipitation and temperature over a period of time in a given region. Such a climate change has been described as a critical global challenge,[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>] especially due to the fact that human activities have been contributory to changes in global climate. It has been observed that over least few decades the average global temperature has risen by 0.5°C due to anthropogenic emissions,[
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>] and projections for 2100 AD suggest that average global temperatures will rise by 2.4–5.8°C.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] Such gradual increase in temperatures is likely to be associated with melting of ice caps, submergence of coastal areas, adverse precipitation events, and floods and droughts in different regions.[
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>] Such change in climate on a global scale is likely to affect the mankind in many different ways. The effect of global climate change is likely to be more severe in developing countries.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attention has been drawn to the variety of health impact of climate change. Global climate change is likely to be associated with spread of vector borne diseases, injuries and deaths due to extreme weather conditions such as floods, storms, and cyclones, thermal injury due to exposure to heat, risk of spread of water-borne infections due to floods and coastal water warming, and reduction in regional crop yields leading to malnutrition.[

  <a rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref8">8</a>
  <a rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref9">9</a>] The impact of global climate change on health is likely to be substantial. Mental health comprises an important component of health and is also likely to be affected by global climate change. The present narrative review discusses the mental health impact of global climate change from the point of view of a developing country.
