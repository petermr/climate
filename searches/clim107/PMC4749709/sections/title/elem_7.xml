 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If we accept that the social identity approach offers a helpful theoretical lens through which to examine environmental attitudes and behavior, then it should also be able to offer solutions to address environmental problems and conflicts. We provide some social-identity based strategies below and a summary can be found in 
  <span class="bold">Table 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>.
  </span> They are not exhaustive but are instead meant to provide a starting point that can stimulate future research to empirically test and further refine social identity approaches relating to the environment. Although some of these strategies have been discussed previously (see e.g., 
  <a rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72">Reynolds et al., 2015</a>; 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">Ferguson et al., in press</a>), we see a benefit in presenting the range of strategies that emerge as the logical outcome of our social identity analysis of environmental attitudes and behavior.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Use Ingroup Messengers</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When thinking about how to promote more positive pro-environmental outcomes, an important consideration is where the messages come from. Consistent with social identity theory we know that ingroup sources are perceived to be more trusted and credible and therefore more influential (
   <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">Hornsey et al., 2002</a>; 
   <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">Kahan et al., 2011</a>). This suggests the need for pro-environmental messages to come from ingroup members whenever possible.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, this may not always be possible; sometimes the environmental issue is a scientific or technical one requiring specific expertise. It may be possible even in this case for the outgroup spokesperson to emphasize a shared superordinate identity with the audience. As an example, 
   <a rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75">Schultz and Fielding (2014)</a> showed that when a scientist provided information about recycled water—a potentially contentious solution to address water shortage situations—and emphasized the social identity she shared with participants (i.e., they all resided in a particular region), highly identified participants had greater support for this sustainable water source.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forging a Superordinate Identity to Reduce Intergroup Environmental Conflict</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conflict between groups on environmental issues has the potential to impede progress on addressing these issues. As we outlined above, intergroup conflict reinforces the boundaries between groups so that group members relate more to each other as group members, and are therefore more likely to exhibit ingroup-favoring attitudes and behaviors. When thought of in this way it is easy to see how this type of intergroup context can stand in the way of developing bi-partisan climate change policy, or sustainable resource allocation that benefits the environment as well as other stakeholders.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way that negative intergroup relations could be transformed is through forging a more inclusive superordinate identity that encompasses conflicting subgroups (
   <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">Gaertner et al., 1993</a>; 
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Gaertner and Dovidio, 2000</a>; 
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Opotow and Brook, 2003</a>). Focusing sub-group members on a higher order, superordinate group identity helps to shift the context from one of ‘them’ and ‘us’ to ‘we’. Past research has shown that this strategy can reduce prejudice and discrimination (
   <a rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36">Gaertner and Dovidio, 2000</a>) because outgroup members are now part of the ingroup and are therefore accorded the benefits of ingroup membership. 
   <a rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8">Batalha and Reynolds (2012)</a> highlight the importance of superordinate identity as a way to develop more effective global negotiations around climate change mitigation. Drawing on the Actualizing Social and Personal Identity Resources model (ASPIRe model; 
   <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">Haslam et al., 2003</a>), they argue that negotiations may be more effective if subgroups are formed that reflect the mutual concerns and interests of like-minded nations and that these subgroups then work together to forge a superordinate framework. The ASPIRe model provides a process for forming superordinate identity beginning with identifying the current social identities that people use to define themselves, followed by the formation of subgroups and the articulation of subgroup goals. The final steps involve the overarching organizational group—incorporating all subgroups—formulating superordinate group goals that inform subsequent action. More broadly, the social identity literature suggests that conditions for making a group such as a superordinate identity ‘real’ are accessibility of the identity, fit (as discussed in section “The Fluidity of Social Identity”), and entitativity (i.e., a combination of interdependence, common fate, physical proximity, similarity; 
   <a rid="B63" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63">Oakes et al., 1991</a>; 
   <a rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80">Sherman et al., 1999</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <a rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73">Samuelson et al. (2003)</a> also provide a concrete example of how conflict between stakeholders over watershed restoration efforts can be transformed through forging a new superordinate identity. The formation of the San Antonio Watershed Council involved bringing a variety of stakeholders together in a structured communication setting that allowed collaborative learning. The formation of the new group identity allowed stakeholders from different subgroups who came with opposing positions to reach consensus and develop a set of recommendations to improve the quality of the watershed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forging a superordinate identity, though, should not entail group members losing or negating their subgroup identity. In fact, research has shown that there are greater reductions in intergroup bias when people identify with both their subgroup and a superordinate group simultaneously (
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Hornsey and Hogg, 2000a</a>,
   <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">b</a>). In the context of intergroup environmental conflicts, 
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Opotow and Brook (2003)</a> argue that retaining subgroup identities can allow the positive attitudes that can develop because of shared superordinate group identity to generalize to the broader subgroup. For example, in the context of the conflict relating to fracking of coal seam gas in Australia, the Lock the Gate Alliance includes farmers and environmentalists, groups that are usually not in alliance. To the extent that Lock the Gate members retain their subgroup identities, this makes it more likely that farmers and environmentalists can develop more positive, nuanced and less stereotypical impressions of each other’s groups. Preserving subgroup identities also reduces the risk that subgroup identities are threatened (
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Hornsey and Hogg, 2000a</a>) and allows an appreciation of the distinctiveness of subgroup identities such as the expertise and experiences of specific subgroups (
   <a rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65">Opotow and Brook, 2003</a>).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linking Identity and Pro-environmental Outcomes</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a social identity approach, a simple way to promote more positive pro-environmental outcomes is to make salient an identity that incorporates pro-environmental norms and/or to provide pathways for people to identify more strongly with pro-environmental social identities. A simple demonstration of the latter approach is provided in research by 
   <a rid="B96" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96">Van der Werff et al. (2013</a>, 
   <a rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97">2014</a>) although their focus is on making salient self-identity rather than a group identity. They show that reminding people of their past pro-environmental actions leads them to strengthen their identity as a pro-environmental person which subsequently leads to further pro-environmental behaviors. It is easy to envisage how this approach could be scaled up through simple messages that ask people to reflect on their various past actions that help to protect the environment. Campaigns that address local environmental issues, such as drought, are also an opportunity to showcase pro-environmental norms (i.e., relating to water conservation) as a defining element of the identity. Activating the regional identity could thereby make salient and strengthen the water conservation norms and could result in lower ongoing water consumption in the region.

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Promoting Pro-environmental Ingroup Norms</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following on from the point above, there is strong evidence that people are more likely to act in environmentally friendly ways when the norms of a behaviorally relevant ingroup—especially one that people identify highly with—are supportive of pro-environmental action. It may not always be possible to make salient a social identity with supportive environmental norms and, as we noted previously, it is often the case that ingroups have positive environmental injunctive norms but negative environmental descriptive norms (i.e., most group members support pro-environmental action but only a minority actually engage in it). Research has shown that placing a greater emphasis on the injunctive norm can help to overcome the problem of a negative descriptive norm (
   <a rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74">Schultz et al., 2007</a>; 
   <a rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81">Smith and Louis, 2008</a>). Thus, rather than drawing attention to the negative ingroup descriptive norms (e.g., only a minority of young people are engaging in actions to protect the environment) the focus needs to be on the positive injunctive norm (a majority of young people support actions that protect the environment).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If ingroup norms are not pro-environmental, another strategy supported by the social identity approach (and discussed above) is to make salient a higher order social category that does have pro-environmental norms. For example, data show that young adults engage in less pro-environmental behavior than older age groups (
   <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">Eurobarometer, 2011</a>). Hence, making a higher order identity salient—for example, a national identity that encompasses more pro-environmental age groups—may help to reinforce pro-environmental norms and positively influence pro-environmental behavior as these norms and behavior can be truthfully attributed to the broader ingroup. This strategy may be more likely to be effective when the lower order category (e.g., young people) are represented as part of the broader social group (
   <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">Hornsey and Hogg, 2000a</a>). For example, communication that reminds people that members of their country support pro-environmental policy and behavior could be accompanied by images that incorporate a range of citizens including younger citizens. Whether or not this approach could work in contexts where the subordinate identity is particularly salient, such as young people making environmental decisions in the presence of their peers, remains an empirical question.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To this point, we have described strategies that could help to shift perceptions of ingroup norms. A more direct approach is suggested by 
   <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Seyranian (2014)</a> and 
   <a rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79">Seyranian et al. (2015)</a> who advance the concept of social identity framing as a way to shape the content of ingroup identity. This approach outlines a process whereby a leader can shift social identity content in a direction that can help to promote positive social change. They highlight the need for leaders to advance a vision to group members through the use of inclusive ingroup language (e.g., we, us). As an example, when ingroup leaders advocated for renewable energy using inclusive language, support for renewable energy was perceived to be more ingroup normative and there were greater intentions on the part of ingroup members to act in relation to renewable energy (
   <a rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78">Seyranian, 2014</a>). Further research is needed to identify the critical elements that are most effective at changing the content of ingroup identity.
