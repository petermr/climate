 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As outlined above, when social identity becomes salient, similarities amongst ingroup members and differences between ingroup and outgroup members are accentuated. As a result, ingroup members assimilate their attitudes and behaviors to ingroup norms and away from outgroup norms. Perhaps the starkest example of this process can be seen in relation to the impact of political party affiliation on climate change attitudes. 
  <a rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" href="#B57">McCright and Dunlap (2011)</a> have shown that Democrats in the U.S. have greater belief in and concern for climate change than Republicans. These political alignments are confirmed by other U.S. research (
  <a rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64">O’Connor et al., 2002</a>; 
  <a rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" href="#B67">Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2006</a>) and extend to other countries. For example in Australia, Labor (a center-left party) and Green party supporters and politicians had greater belief in anthropogenic climate change than (conservative) Liberal/National supporters and politicians (
  <a rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92">Tranter, 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31">Fielding et al., 2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, the relationship between political affiliation and belief in climate change is likely to be bi-directional. Some people will be drawn to a particular party on the basis of their independently formed attitudes toward climate change, meaning that social identity follows individual attitude formation. But a social identity approach would presume that the other causal path – that affiliation influences attitudes – would be even more pronounced. An example of this pathway was provided by 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">Cohen (2003)</a>, who showed that partisan Democrats and Republicans responded to the 
  <span class="italic">very same welfare policies</span> in entirely different ways depending on which party participants were led to believe initiated the policies: when Democrats thought a policy had emanated from the Republican party, they saw the policy as much less moral and acceptable than when the same policy was attributed to the Democrats (and vice versa). This research shows that a message can be rejected or accepted entirely on the basis of the group allegiance of the messenger (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">Hornsey and Imani, 2004</a>; 
  <a rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26">Esposo et al., 2013</a>). Political identities provide salient attitudes, beliefs, and norms that describe and prescribe party supporters’ views on these issues. The majority of the evidence for this argument is correlational, but one recent study provides experimental evidence. 
  <a rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94">Unsworth and Fielding (2014)</a> showed that when political identity was made salient, participants who were aligned with the conservative Liberal/National parties in Australia had lower belief in anthropogenic climate change and were less likely to support climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further evidence for the influence of ingroup norms comes from norm focus theory which differentiates between injunctive social norms which describe what is approved or desired by group members and descriptive norms which describe what the majority of group members actually do (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Cialdini et al., 1990</a>). The independent and interactive effects of these norms has been demonstrated in the environmental domain including in relation to littering (
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">Cialdini et al., 1990</a>), towel reuse in hotels (
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Goldstein et al., 2008</a>), energy conservation behavior (
  <a rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62">Nolan et al., 2008</a>; 
  <a rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23">Dwyer et al., 2015</a>), recycling behavior (
  <a rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35">Fornara et al., 2011</a>; 
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">Long et al., 2014</a>; 
  <a rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76">Schwab et al., 2014</a>), eco-friendly consumer behavior (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">Kim et al., 2012</a>), and intentions to take part in a neighborhood climate protection group (
  <a rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" href="#B71">Rees and Bamberg, 2014</a>). On the flipside, when American participants were provided with information that Americans are excessive energy consumers (a negative descriptive norm) they were less concerned about climate change and less supportive of climate change policy than when they learned that China was an excessive energy user or they did not receive information (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">Jang, 2013</a>). In other words, American participants conformed to the ingroup descriptive norm, albeit a negative one.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">Goldstein et al. (2008)</a> have also tested whether norms that came from different identities had differing effects on towel reuse. They found that it was the norms that relate to the most relevant and proximal identity—past guests of the participants’ current hotel room – that had the most influence on towel reuse. Although current guests may not necessarily identify strongly with past guests, they share an identity and the behavior of past guests provides the salient script for how to behave in this particular context. Therefore, this finding fits with the social identity approach that people will be guided by the norms of the most behaviorally relevant ingroup in a specific context.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other research has shown that when norms are misaligned or in conflict it can weaken effects on behavior. For example, when there is a lack of alignment between what the ingroup approves of and what they actually do in relation to energy conservation, ingroup members’ energy conservation intentions are undermined (
  <a rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82">Smith et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, perceiving conflict in the pro-environmental descriptive norms across ingroups can either energize or demotivate intentions to act in pro-environmental ways depending on group members’ pre-existing environmental attitudes (
  <a rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" href="#B58">McDonald et al., 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The social identity approach also acknowledges that the influence of ingroup norms should be stronger for those who are more highly identified with the group (
  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">Ellemers et al., 1999</a>). For example, social identification with organic consumers predicts willingness to purchase organic products (
  <a rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6">Bartels and Reinders, 2010</a>; 
  <a rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5">Bartels and Onwezen, 2014</a>), environmental group membership predicts environmental activism intentions (
  <a rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32">Fielding et al., 2008a</a>), and identification with environmentalists predicts environmental behavior and environmental activism (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">Dono et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, more strongly identified group members are more likely to intend to engage in ingroup normative behaviors, such as recycling (
  <a rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91">Terry et al., 1999</a>; 
  <a rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" href="#B100">White et al., 2009</a>) and sustainable agricultural practices (
  <a rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33">Fielding et al., 2008b</a>). In other words, the more highly identified group members are, the more salient will be the norms of the group and the more likely they will be to guide behavior. Recent research examining different dimensions of ingroup identification has also shown that it is the self-investment dimension of identification (i.e., importance of and satisfaction with the group) that influenced adherence to ingroup norms relating to reducing carbon emissions (
  <a rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56">Masson and Fritsche, 2014</a>).
