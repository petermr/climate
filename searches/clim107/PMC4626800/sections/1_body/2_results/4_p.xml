<p class="p">The factorial analysis of variance to the ET estimates show that changes in vegetation greenness, air temperature and vapor pressure, and the two-way interactive effect of air temperature and vapor pressure are the dominant factors contributing to the multi-decadal changes in global ET (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). The direct effects of varying air temperature and vapor pressure have opposite impacts on ET relative to their two-way interactive effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>), leading to a small net effect on ET. Changes in solar radiation impose a slight positive effect on ET, while wind speed and atmospheric CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>, respectively; however, these effects are predominantly outweighed by the impact of vegetation change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). As a result, the net effect of climate change and CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> fertilization is positive but much smaller than the effect of vegetation change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>), indicating that vegetation change is the primary driver of the global ET trend over the study period. Considering that vegetation change is also a response of the Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems to climate change, climate change imposes an indirect impact on ET by influencing global vegetation.
