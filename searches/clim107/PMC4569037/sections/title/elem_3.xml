 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modeling approach</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The basic assumption of our common reed model is that a new reed stand arises from seed. This assumption is now strongly supported – especially for Québec – by several recent field and genetic studies (Brisson et al. 
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">2008</a>; Belzile et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2010</a>; McCormick et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2010</a>; Kettenring et al. 
  <a rid="b40" ref-type="bibr" href="#b40">2011</a>; Kirk et al. 
  <a rid="b43" ref-type="bibr" href="#b43">2011</a>; Albert et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2015</a>). Consequently, the model took into account the parameters (climatic, hydrologic, and biotic conditions) associated with common reed sexual reproduction and seedling establishment. Subsequent vegetative propagation was not addressed in this study. Competition with other plant species slows the vegetative propagation of the common reed, but it does not prevent its spread (Bellavance and Brisson 
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">2010</a>). In other words, the model focussed on locating suitable germination grounds in wetlands as starting points for the establishment of new common reed stands. Several steps were required to develop this model; these steps are presented in the following paragraphs.
 </p>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 1: Distribution of common reed stands</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on the historical distribution of common reed stands were gathered through aerial photographs. It is possible to distinguish stands of a certain size (≥5 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) in black and white or infrared photographs at a scale ≤1:15,000 (Warren et al. 
   <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">2001</a>; Wilcox et al. 
   <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">2003</a>; Hudon et al. 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2005</a>; Maheu-Giroux and de Blois 
   <a rid="b53" ref-type="bibr" href="#b53">2005</a>). This work was performed for the only sector in which common reed stands were both abundant and old enough to build a valid historical reconstruction, that is, the Boucherville Islands. The database used is based on a mapping carried out by Hudon et al. (
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2005</a>), which covered 1980 (1 ha of common reed stands) to 2002 (33 ha). Using a geographic information system, the centroid of each large common reed stand, which was primarily circular in shape, was georeferenced when first detected. The most recent genetic data gathered at Boucherville Islands (Albert et al. 
   <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2015</a>) indicated that each stand was monoclonal, created through the germination of a single seed, followed by the extension of rhizomes and stolons in every direction. The centroid of a common reed stand therefore roughly corresponds to the location of the germination bed that permitted successful reed stand establishment.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current distribution of common reed stands was mapped through remote sensing using high-definition WorldView–02 and QuickBird–02 satellite images taken between August 15 and September 18, 2010. A configuration of four multispectral bands (near infrared, red, green and blue) was used, providing a spatial resolution of approximately 2.4 m. Common reed stands were identified and delineated using spectral signatures developed by Létourneau and Jean (
   <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2005</a>) based on training areas located in the St. Lawrence River wetlands. Because the spectral signature of the common reed is somewhat similar to that of the reed canary grass (
   <span class="italic">Phalaris arundinacea</span> L.), a plant species also commonly found in the St. Lawrence River floodplain, the map created from satellite images was validated in the field from helicopter (October 18, 2011) and by foot (September 13 and 14, 2011). In all, 240 previously mapped common reed stands were visited for validation, primarily in the Lake St. Louis, Boucherville Islands, and Lake St. Pierre sectors. These stands were selected through a stratified random sampling, which enabled us to confirm the presence of the common reed based on a range of stand areas (0–10 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, 11–50 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>, ≥51 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>). The map was then adjusted based on results obtained during validation. The centroid of each common reed stand retained on the validated map was localized using the same method used for the historical distribution data.
  </p>

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 2: Parameters conducive to common reed establishment</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the challenges in modeling common reed establishment in a natural environment resides in the fact that it is extremely difficult to determine the exact moment of seed germination, because there is always a lag of a few years between seed germination and the formation of a reed stand (of about 5 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) that can be detected on aerial photographs or satellite images. It was thus impossible to characterize conditions conducive to seed germination and seedling establishment based on historical data. As a result, the model could only be developed using a deductive approach (Ottaviani et al. 
   <a rid="b68" ref-type="bibr" href="#b68">2004</a>) and was essentially based on the most current knowledge regarding the biology of the common reed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bare, wet (not flooded) soils are necessary for a new common reed stand to develop from a seed (Galinato and van der Valk 
   <a rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" href="#b27">1986</a>; Coops and Van der Velde 
   <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1995</a>; Hudon et al. 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2005</a>). Such exposure conditions are present along the St. Lawrence River during summer-long episodes of low water levels or in areas with anthropogenic disturbance (Hudon 
   <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">1997</a>, 
   <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>; Hudon et al. 
   <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2005</a>). These nonflooded conditions must be present at the beginning of the growing season. Seedlings need at least 120 days of growth; otherwise, they are not able to accumulate sufficient reserves, which will hamper their survival the following year, particularly during spring floods and frosts (Haslam 
   <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">1971</a>; Weisner and Ekstam 
   <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">1993</a>; Ekstam and Forseby 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1999</a>). Furthermore, common reed seed germination occurs at a mean daily air temperature of ≥10°C (Haslam 
   <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">1972</a>; Ekstam and Forseby 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1999</a>) and a daily temperature range of ≥10°C (Ekstam and Forseby 
   <a rid="b20" ref-type="bibr" href="#b20">1999</a>). However, very early germination is not necessarily beneficial because seedling risk exposure to late spring frosts (Weisner and Ekstam 
   <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">1993</a>). We thus considered that germination and subsequent seedling growth periods could not start until the first day of the year when mean daily temperatures reached 10°C (and were not followed by temperatures below 0°C) until the first autumn frost.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Light conditions also influence common reed germination and seedling survival (Haslam 
   <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">1972</a>), and a dense tree cover can strongly reduce seedling establishment and growth (Mal and Narine 
   <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">2004</a>; Lelong et al. 
   <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2009</a>; Albert et al. 
   <a rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" href="#b2">2013</a>). Therefore, a robust common reed model must also consider the various classes of wetlands that can be present in a study area, each with their particular tree cover. For this study, we used the ten classes defined specifically for the St. Lawrence River by Desgranges et al. (
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2006</a>), but only the three classes associated with the presence of trees (open treed swamp, closed treed swamp, and damp forest) were considered obstacles to common reed germination and seedling survival (no establishment).

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 3: Structure of the common reed model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common reed model was developed within the infrastructure of the 
   <span class="italic">Integrated Ecosystem Response Model</span> (IERM), a high-resolution spatial database developed by Environment Canada to evaluate the impact of water level fluctuations and flow regulation on the St. Lawrence River ecosystems (Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2005</a>; Morin and Champoux 
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2006</a>). IERM has been successfully used to predict the impact of water level changes on fish and bird reproduction, and on wetland vegetation (Desgranges et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2006</a>; Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2006</a>; Mingelbier et al. 
   <a rid="b59" ref-type="bibr" href="#b59">2008</a>). The methodology used to build the basic datasets and to run IERM is described in Morin and Champoux (
   <a rid="b61" ref-type="bibr" href="#b61">2006</a>) and Morin et al. (
   <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2006</a>). In summary, IERM is based on a spatial grid whose nodes are 20–80 m apart in shallow water areas and 160 m apart in the navigation channel. Several information layers measured in the field or modeled (topography, bathymetry, substratum, water level, current velocity, aquatic vegetation, emergent vegetation) are associated with each node. IERM not only models fluvial physics, but also simulates the spatiotemporal development of ten wetland vegetation classes (Desgranges et al. 
   <a rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" href="#b18">2006</a>; Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2006</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The location of a common reed stand did not necessarily correspond to the exact location of a node of the IERM grid. The IERM node network was therefore transformed into a square polygon grid with surface areas varying from 0.04 to 2.56 ha, depending on the distance between nodes in the original grid. The information associated with the central node of each polygon was then applied to the entire polygon. The presence of at least one common reed stand in a polygon was enough to consider this polygon as conducive to the establishment of the invader. The spatially explicit information layers used in this study were topography, water level, and wetland class. Air temperature data, available at only one station, were extracted from the historical series measured at the Montréal Airport (Dorval-Trudeau; Environment Canada, 
   <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2013</a>). This series is the longest (1953–2012) and most complete available in the study area. These values were also used as references for the entire area (Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2005</a>). Temperature data were thus not spatially distributed: they were associated with each node (polygon), but were the same for all the nodes of the modeling domain. The other data, measured or simulated for each node (polygon) of the grid, were extracted from the models developed by Morin et al. (
   <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2005</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The parameters conducive to common reed seed germination and seedling survival, as presented above (step 2), were integrated into IERM in the form of an algorithm. This algorithm was used to query the geodatabase on a daily basis (for a given year), which then returned all sites whose attributes were within the required parameters, thus identifying potential common reed germination grounds. For example, to verify the presence of an appropriate water level, which required that a site not be flooded at the beginning of the growing season, the water level was examined (based on IERM data) for all polygons each day of a given year. A count began as soon as all conditions conducive to common reed seed germination and seedling survival were met in a polygon. If there were nonflooded conditions, the other parameters conducive to germination were met, and the seedlings had at least 120 days of appropriate growing conditions (no frost), the polygon was identified as a potential site for common reed establishment. Data on temperature and water level measurements were available on daily means, while the wetland classes were reassessed yearly based on environmental conditions observed the previous years. Data related to land use and topography were kept constant.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A daily time step was used for the historical series analysis. However, a quarter-monthly time step was used for the climate change simulations, because the water level series for the St. Lawrence River were available only in quarter-monthly means. The quarter-monthly time step divides time into 7- or 8-day blocks, for a total of 48 quarter-monthly time steps per year. Using quarter-monthly time steps permits the comparison of individual quarter-monthly time steps across years and has the advantage of not being influenced by the number of days in a year (Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>).
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 4: Calibration of the common reed model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The invasion stage, which reflects the proportion of invaded to invadable areas, directly impacts the ability of a model to predict areas vulnerable to invasion (Václavík and Meentemeyer 
   <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">2012</a>). If the invasion is advanced, one can presume that the species occupies most of the sites that foster its establishment; it is then easy to establish a correlation between site conditions and their likelihood of being invaded. It is much more difficult to establish such a correlation if the invasion is still in the early stages: the invader absence at a given site does not necessarily correspond to unfavorable local conditions. Thus, the accuracy of the parameters associated with common reed germination and seedling survival was verified in the Boucherville Islands, that is, in the sector of the river containing one of the oldest populations of the plant, the greatest surface area of common reed stands, and a well-documented invasion history. To do so, the common reed distribution, as simulated by IERM, was compared to the real distribution (see step 1). The simulated distribution was generated from 1980 (beginning of the common reed invasion in this sector) to 2009 and took into account the historical environmental data integrated into IERM. Given that satellite images were taken during the 2010 growing season, the period used for modeling ended in 2009.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The comparison was made using a confusion matrix (Fielding and Bell 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1997</a>), which helped to determine (1) the number of polygons with successful common reed seedling establishment and that were also identified by IERM as potential establishment sites between 1980 and 2009 (true positives); (2) the number of polygons with seedling establishment but that were not identified as such by IERM (false negatives); (3) the number of polygons with no seedling establishment but where the common reed should have established stands according to IERM (false positives); and (4) the number of polygons with no seedling establishment and that were also identified by IERM as not being conducive to the emergence and survival of common reed seedlings (true negatives). To improve the model performance, various combinations of parameters were tested, for example, the inclusion or exclusion of the average daily temperature, daily temperature amplitude, water level, and wetland class. Once calibrated, the common reed model was applied to the entire study area.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that the common reed invasion in the Boucherville Islands is relatively recent and still ongoing, we hypothesized that the polygons identified as false positives, while having a high germination potential, had not yet been invaded either as a result of insufficient time or the random dispersal of seeds. It was also possible that stand size within a false-positive polygon was simply too small to be detected via satellite imagery. To confirm this hypothesis, 213 of the 317 false-positive polygons (randomly selected) in the Boucherville Islands sector were visited between October 1 and 5, 2012. Each polygon was verified by an observer on foot. Searching continued until either common reed was found or the entire polygon had been covered. If common reed stems were found, their origin (from seed – not connected by rhizomes or stolons to adjacent stands – or from vegetative propagation) was noted.</p>

 <sec class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 5: Performance assessment of the common reed model</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common reed model performance was assessed using indices derived from the confusion matrix (Fielding and Bell 
   <a rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" href="#b25">1997</a>). The sensitivity index indicates the proportion of polygons in which seedling establishment occurred, and which were identified by the model as potential germination grounds, in relation to all existing common reed polygons. The specificity measures the proportion of polygons identified by the model as unfavorable to seedling establishment among the entire collection of polygons, and where seedlings did not establish. Lastly, the correct classification rate measures the performance of the entire model. This rate is the total proportion of polygons where concordance exists between the model and reality. Model performance was assessed for the entire study area and for each of the four study sectors.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Step 6: Future distribution of the common reed and climate change scenarios</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the model performance assessed, it was used to identify sites favorable to the establishment of common reed through seeds, either based on current or simulated climatic conditions associated with various climate change scenarios. For this study, the periods compared were 1961–1989 (reference period with actual climate data) and 2040–2069 (simulated climate data; Croley 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>; Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). Simulations of river flows and air temperatures modified by climate change were carried out using mean values from the 2040–2069 period, commonly associated with the year 2050. The simulated climate data were extracted from two general circulation models integrating greenhouse gas emission scenarios, one resulting in very warm and wet conditions (HadCM3 A1FI) and the other under very warm and dry conditions (CGCM2 A21; Mortsch et al. 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>). Among all the climate change scenarios available for modeling (Mortsch et al. 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>), these two scenarios were the most recent ones providing hydrologic series for the study area and corresponded to conditions that differed most from those currently known for the St. Lawrence River sector under study. The hydrologic series with climate change data were only available in a quarter-monthly time step format.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each climate change scenario was associated with monthly temperature differences, also known as monthly deltas, between current values and those of the 2040–2069 period. From the overall number of climate models developed for small-scale gridding (approximately 400-km
   <span class="sup">2</span> grids; Mortsch et al. 
   <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2005</a>), a unique monthly value was applied to the entire study area. Daily temperature data recorded at Dorval-Trudeau (1961–1989) were used as reference. The monthly temperature deltas were then applied to each quarter-monthly time step of the series measured at Dorval-Trudeau for the entire period studied. The monthly differences applied to the reference temperature data for scenario HadCM3 A1FI were, on average, 4°C, and ranged from 3.2°C (May) to 5.2°C (August). For scenario CGCM2 A21, the average monthly temperature difference was 3.0°C and ranged from 1.0°C (December) to 5.9°C (January). The beginning and the end of the common reed germination and seedling growth period, determined using mean daily temperature values, were recalculated for each climate change scenario based on the adjusted temperature data available in a quarter-monthly time step format.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulated data from the 2040–2069 scenarios were generated using the delta method (Croley 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>) and expressed as hydrologic series. Water flows from the Great Lakes watershed were simulated by Croley (
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>) and took into account precipitation, evapotranspiration, ice cover, soil humidity, and surface water runoff. The water flows were then adjusted according to projected climate differences (monthly deltas), and new predictive hydrologic series were developed, incorporating the influence of climate change scenarios on St. Lawrence River flows.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of four hydrologic series were used in this study. The first two series were (1) the historically measured (MEAS) series, corresponding to the data observed between 1961 and 1989 (Morin and Bouchard 
   <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2000</a>; Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2003</a>); and (2) the comparison (COMP) series, developed using the same method as for the climate change series, but taking into account previous climate data (1961–1989; Croley 
   <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2003</a>; Fagherazzi et al. 
   <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2005</a>; Morin et al. 
   <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). The COMP series was used to compare results with or without climate change, thereby identifying any biases associated with this comparison method. If the models were perfect, the COMP series would provide the same results as the MEAS series. The next two series, used for future climate conditions; were (3) the warm and wet (WAWE) series, associated with climate scenario HadCM3 A1FI; and (4) the warm and dry (WADR) series, associated with scenario CGCM2 A21. The MEAS and COMP series were roughly similar, but to fully understand the impact of climate change on hydrology, it was important to compare both climate change scenarios to the COMP series and not the MEAS series. Finally, to determine the impacts of climate change on wetlands, the model was initiated with reference conditions from 1960. Changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of the various classes of wetlands were determined by the hydrologic conditions associated with each hydrologic series (see Turgeon et al. 
   <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">2005</a>; Morin and Champoux
