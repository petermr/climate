  <p>Spatial distribution of common reed (
   <span class="italic">Phragmites australis</span>) stands identified in four St. Lawrence River sectors by remote sensing images (2010) and modeled spatial distribution of germination grounds suitable for the species that have not yet been invaded. Germination grounds vulnerable to a common reed invasion are cumulated for the 1980–2009 period.
