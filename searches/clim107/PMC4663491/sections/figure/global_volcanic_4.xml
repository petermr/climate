   <span class="bold">a</span>) Number of Magnitude ≥6 (Pinatubo-sized or larger) NH and SH eruptions per two millennia from present to 80 ka BP. The low number of known SH volcanic eruptions prior to the last two ka reflects a significant undercount in known eruptions. (

Intervals characterised by high ice volume and low insolation hypothesised as relatively insensitive to SH eruptions are highlighted in blue; intervals with very low ice volume lacking the positive feedback required to sufficiently amplify volcanic eruptions are highlighted in orange.
