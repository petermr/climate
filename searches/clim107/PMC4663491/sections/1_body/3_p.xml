<p class="p">The stratospheric sulphate loading associated with large SH eruptions could have had the opposite effect, preferentially cooling the SH relative to the NH, shifting the ITCZ to the north, compressing the NH Polar Cell, and shifting the NH Polar Front to the north (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). We suggest that this northward shift in the polar fronts in response to large SH eruptions resulted in dramatic warming across the North Atlantic and NH glaciated regions, promoting sea ice collapse and the partial retreat of continental ice sheets, all characteristic features of DO events. The presence of large continental ice sheets would have provided a strong positive feedback. The proposed northward NH Polar Front migration would have caused continental ice sheet retreat, consequently reducing albedo, destabilising NH permafrost, and resulting in subtle methane increases characteristic of DO events

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. The flux of radiocarbon-depleted carbon into the atmosphere during DO events, often interpreted as AMOC strengthening and increased outgassing of radiocarbon depleted-bottom waters, may also originate from permafrost thaw, as previously suggested for the Bølling/Allerød
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. The lower albedo and strengthened AMOC following NH ice sheet decay following SH eruptions could have produced a positive feedback that prevented the short-term re-establishment of continental ice sheets to their full glacial extent as favoured by still low atmospheric CO

This caused a gradual return to pre-eruption conditions hundreds or even thousands of years after the initial sulphate forcing, unless the slow process was expedited by a large NH eruption (forcing an abrupt return to stadial conditions, as was the case following the Toba eruption) or the cooling process was interrupted by another SH eruption, as may have occurred after an unknown SH eruption triggered DO-13 at 49.5 ka BP (
