<p class="p">BTV range increased from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5 (potential distributional area increased by 8.11% between present-day and RCP 2.6, and by 9.08% between present-day and RCP 8.5). Differences were also noted in the future potential BTV ranges of different models within each climate scenario (
