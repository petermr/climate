 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land loss has been extensive since 1850, especially along the western shore (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). As of 2013, only 33.25% (319.35 HA) of the Tangier Islands remain since 1850 (875.33 HA) giving a mean annual loss of 3.41 HA yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Variance was highest along the western shores of the Islands, especially Uppards Island (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplemental Fig. 2</a>) and Tangier Island, before breakwater construction. We fit linear regressions (all parameters had p &lt; 0.05), to the data to predict the lifespan of the island system (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>) using the historic land- loss rate projected into the future. Best fits were linear, quadratic or cubic (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplemental Table 1</a>). These fits suggest that, if historic rates of land loss and RSLR were to continue, the islands should be inundated by 2106, possibly as early as 2070. Goose Island, the smallest island of the three, is the first predicted to be completely submerged-before 2050 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Figs 3</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">4</a>)-regardless of the RSLR scenario (linear, low, mid, or high) chosen. The low and mid-range RSLR scenarios predict a similar time of inundation for Uppards and Tangier by approximately 2106, with the high RSLR scenario predicting these islands will be lost by the late 2060s.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then separated island transects of shoreline data from 1850, 1905, 1938, 1943, 1960, 1987, 2001, 2009 and 2013 into western, eastern, and interior shores using USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System, and developed estimates of land loss over time for these shorelines. The erosion rate on the eastern shore of Tangier Island (1850–2013) was lower (86.61 m or 0.53 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) than that of the eastern Uppards Island shoreline (214.52 m or 1.32 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). In order to assess the possible impact of major storms (wind speeds from 63 to &gt;119 km hr
  <span class="sup">-1</span>), we consulted historic records
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a> to identify major storms that struck the Tangier Islands (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplemental Fig. 3</a>) and assessed Uppards Island out of the three main islands due to its large size, similar persistence to Tangier Island and that it has not been protected by any stone breakwaters as Tangier has been. For Uppards Island eastern shoreline, RSLR is the driving factor for land losses (multiple linear regression, p &gt; 0.291 for storms over time, p &lt; 0.019 for RSLR over time). Major storms had significant impacts on the western shores of Uppards Island (multiple linear regression, p &lt; 0.028 for storms, p = 0.763 for RSLR). Interior shorelines of tidal creeks have also lost significant land since 1850 (0.301 m yr
  <span class="sup">−1</span>); however, due to limited data we were unable to resolve the reason statistically. These estimated future rates of land loss developed from the regressions were applied when we used ARCGIS to project future land-loss scenarios.
