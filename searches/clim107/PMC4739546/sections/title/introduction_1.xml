 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marine fish and invertebrate species are impacted by climate change and decadal variability. A classic example is the historical oscillation between Pacific Sardine and Northern Anchovy populations in the California Current, which occurred before recorded human exploitation began [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref001">1</a>]. More recently, changes in marine species distribution and population productivity have been linked to changes in the climate [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref002">2</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref005">5</a>]. Changes have also been documented in the distribution of fishery landings and potentially the distribution and magnitude of fishing effort [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref006">6</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref007">7</a>]. Although fishing remains an important, and in many cases, dominant driver of population abundance, there is now substantial evidence that climate change and decadal variability affect fish and invertebrate populations [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref008">8</a>–

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An increasing number of studies are linking population models to climate models and projecting the effect of future climate change on marine fish and invertebrate species [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref011">11</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref016">16</a>]. These studies develop either a process-based or empirical relationship between climate variables and population parameters. Projections of the climate factor from climate models are then used to force the population model into the future [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref017">17</a>]. In general, these studies show that climate change will continue to impact species and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., fisheries, forage, [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref018">18</a>]) for the foreseeable future (decades to centuries). For many regions, developing a mechanistic model for each species is not possible in the short-term because of the limited personnel and scientific resources, the lack of mechanistic models linking climate to population dynamics, and the large number of managed species. Global and regional species distribution models have been linked to climate projections to project changes in available habitat and resulting distribution shifts [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref019">19</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref020">20</a>]. These studies typically do not focus on providing species-specific information that can be used by regional fisheries managers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trait-based climate change vulnerability assessments provide another method to evaluate the potential risks to species posed by climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref021">21</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref023">23</a>]. In general, vulnerability assessments are a formal approach for identifying and prioritizing the vulnerabilities in a system [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref023">23</a>]. They often involve expert elicitation to estimate the general sensitivities of species to a stressor. The approach fills the need for broad, transparent, relatively quick evaluation of the vulnerability of multiple species. Vulnerability assessments have been used to evaluate the risk of overfishing for species within given regions [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref024">24</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref025">25</a>] and are increasingly being used to evaluate the vulnerabilities of marine species to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref031">31</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are many forms, but in general, trait-based vulnerability assessments identify: i) environmental variables expected to change that could impact species (termed exposure factors) and ii) sensitivity attributes that predict a species intrinsic resilience to change [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref021">21</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref022">22</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref029">29</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref032">32</a>]. Some vulnerability assessments separate sensitivity into two components: adaptive capacity and sensitivity [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref033">33</a>], but we choose to combine adaptive capacity attributes with sensitivity attributes [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref034">34</a>]. Specifically for climate vulnerability, exposure factors include climate variables that have the potential to affect productivity or distribution of a species (or population) in a specific region. For example, temperature is a climate factor that affects species via multiple mechanisms from enzyme reactions to feeding rate to seasonal distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref035">35</a>]. Species sensitivity attributes include biological or ecological variables that predict the vulnerability to climate change. For example, a species with an inherently low maximum per capita population growth rate is more sensitive to changes in climate compared to species with an inherently high maximum per capita population growth rate. The exposure factors and sensitivity attributes are scored for each species based on a pre-defined scoring system. These scores are combined across exposure factors and sensitivity attributes to derive a relative species-specific climate vulnerability score. While these methods have limitations, the framework allows a diverse set of species to be assessed in a relatively short period of time, and provides a foundation for further research and management responses [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our objective was to conduct a climate vulnerability assessment for fish and invertebrate species in the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (hereafter Northeast U.S. Shelf) using the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref034">34</a>]. We use climate projections between 2005–2055 to evaluate climate change and decadal variability in the 20–40 year time frame. Separating anthropogenic climate change from natural decadal variability is difficult [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref036">36</a>] and although we use climate change throughout most of this paper, it is important to recognize that the signals of both change and variability are included in the projections. We define vulnerability as a change in a species’ productivity and or abundance associated with a changing climate, including both climate change and decadal climate variability. We also evaluate the potential for a change in distribution and estimate the directional effect (positive or negative) of a changing climate on species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf. This ecosystem supports valuable commercial ($1.6 billion from landings in 2013 [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref037">37</a>]) and recreational ($14.8 billion in total angler expenditures [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref038">38</a>]) fisheries. The region is also experiencing relatively rapid climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref039">39</a>]. Numerous studies have linked recent climate change to changes in the region’s fish and invertebrate populations, including changes in productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref008">8</a>] and distribution [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref040">40</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref043">43</a>]. Of the numerous fishery species in the region, climate variables have only been directly incorporated into scientific advice and management in a few cases [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref044">44</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref045">45</a>]. Although this species-by-species approach is necessary, scientists and managers alike need a broad perspective within which to set research priorities and frame management decisions. Our purpose in conducting this vulnerability assessment is to provide such a system-wide perspective for the Northeast U.S. Shelf.
