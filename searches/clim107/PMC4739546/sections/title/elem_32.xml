  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 82 species were nearly equally split among the different climate vulnerability ranks: very high (~27%), high (~23%), moderate (~24%) and low (~26%) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" href="#pone.0146756.g003">Fig 3</a>). Climate exposure scores for all 82 species were high or very high indicating the magnitude of climate change relative to the variability of past conditions is high. Biological sensitivity ranged from low to very high. The certainty in the score of the majority of species exceeded 90% based on the bootstrap analysis (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g003" href="#pone.0146756.g003">Fig 3</a>). Approximately 27% of species had certainty scores between 66–90%. Approximately 12% of species had certainty scores &lt;66%. For certainty scores less than 50%, a majority of bootstrapped climate vulnerability scores were different than the actual score. Species narratives provide species-specific summaries of the results (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Potential for Distribution Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many species in the Northeast U.S. Shelf have life history attributes that suggest distribution may change in response to climate change (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g004" href="#pone.0146756.g004">Fig 4</a>). More than 50% of the species exhibit very high or high potential for a change in species distribution. In general, overall climate vulnerability (changes in population productivity) varies inversely to the potential for a change in species distribution: species highly vulnerable to a change in productivity have a lower potential to change distribution and vice versa (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s010" href="#pone.0146756.s010">S8 Supporting Information</a>). However, the certainty potential for distribution change score of almost half the species was &lt;66%; this lower value of certainty compared to overall climate vulnerability results from the lower number of attributes included in the potential for distribution change calculation.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Directional Effect of Climate Change</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on expert opinion of the directional effect of climate change, approximately half of the species were assessed to be negatively affected by climate change in the Northeast U.S. Shelf (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g005" href="#pone.0146756.g005">Fig 5</a>). Negative impacts are estimated for many of the iconic species in the ecosystem including Atlantic Sea Scallop, Atlantic Cod, and Atlantic Mackerel. In general, negative effects are anticipated for a number of Benthic Invertebrate and Groundfish species. However, positive effects are anticipated for 17% of species including Inshore Longfin Squid, Butterfish, and Atlantic Croaker. The certainty in directional effect score varied, but was &gt;95% for almost half of the species assessed. However, there were species with low certainty (&lt;66%) in all three directional effect categories. By comparing across the climate vulnerability, potential for distribution change, and directional effect scores, species can be identified that are likely to increase in productivity (e.g., Black Sea Bass) or shift into the region (e.g., Atlantic Croaker) or that are likely to decrease in productivity (e.g., Winter Flounder) or shift out of the region (e.g., Atlantic Mackerel).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean ocean surface temperature change (upper 10 m) and mean surface pH change were determined to be important factors in the climate vulnerability scores (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g006" href="#pone.0146756.g006">Fig 6</a>). These factors were scored as very high exposure for all species owing to the magnitude of change projected by 2055 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s011" href="#pone.0146756.s011">S9 Supporting Information</a>). Mean surface air temperature change (as a proxy for shallow water temperatures) and to a lesser extent sea-level rise were also important for species that were exposed to these factors (Coastal Fish and Diadromous Fish species). Exposure factors that were not as important in determining vulnerability scores exhibited a lower magnitude of change, particularly the variance of the exposure factors and mean changes in precipitation and ocean surface salinity.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effects of climate change exhibited some consistency across functional groups. In terms of overall climate vulnerability, Diadromous Fish and Benthic Invertebrate species had the highest vulnerabilities (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g008" href="#pone.0146756.g008">Fig 8</a>). Some Coastal Fish species also scored very highly vulnerable to climate change. Elasmobranchs and Groundfish groups had no species that scored very highly vulnerable, and Pelagic Fish and Cephalopod species had no species that scored very highly or highly vulnerable. Potential for distribution change also varied by functional groups (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g008" href="#pone.0146756.g008">Fig 8</a>). Only Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods and Elasmobranchs had very high potential for a distribution change. Diadromous Fish, Benthic Invertebrates, and Groundfish had species with a low potential for distribution change. Similarly, the directional effect of climate change varied across functional groups. All groups had species where negative effects of climate change are estimated and Benthic Invertebrates and Groundfish had greatest proportion of species with estimated negative effects. Only Coastal Fish and Pelagic Fish and Cephalopods had species where positive effects of climate change are estimated within the Northeast U.S. Shelf ecosystem. MDS ordination of sensitivity attributes exhibited some consistency within functional groups but also demonstrated that certain species have attribute that are more similar to species in other functional groups (
