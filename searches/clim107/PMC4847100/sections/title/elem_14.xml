 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation to climate change is a global challenge that supra-national institutions and individual countries are only now beginning to address in most regions of the world [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-13-00438">9</a>]. It is also a great challenge for local governance, where it remains a low priority due to busy agendas, limited resources, lack of professional knowledge, limited public support and, sometimes, limited decision-making authority [
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-13-00438">87</a>,
  <a rid="B88-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-ijerph-13-00438">88</a>,
  <a rid="B89-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-ijerph-13-00438">89</a>,
  <a rid="B90-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijerph-13-00438">90</a>]. For example, recent research found that climate action plans in the US fail to adequately protect health from climate change-related extreme heat [
  <a rid="B91-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijerph-13-00438">91</a>] and, in Australia, urban planners, who are key professionals for adaptation at the city-level, are not aware of predicted climate change health impacts and adaptation measures [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although there are differences between living standards, socio-economic levels and infrastructure in the five cities we examined, all of them are located in regions highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on the Mediterranean climate and therefore should deal with similar challenges. Some are contradictory phenomena, such as temperature extremes: intense heat waves in summer but also cold waves in winter, as well as floods and droughts, which may be more complicated than in more extreme environments. Four of the five cities are located by the sea and therefore have to deal with a rising sea level which may lead to floods, salinization of groundwater and negative impacts on water supply. While the populations of LA, Adelaide and Barcelona live in three of the 14 countries with the highest global socioeconomic rating, in severe weather conditions many residents may be at risk, particularly vulnerable populations. In those cities, 8%–11.2% of the population is unemployed and many others are below the poverty line (22% in LA and more than 28% in Barcelona). The elderly (21.6% of the population in Barcelona are above 65 years old) are also at high risk in conditions of severe heat or cold. Risks for health as a result of climate change are higher in cities such as Cape Town and Santiago, which are situated in less developed countries (see 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-13-00438-t001" href="#ijerph-13-00438-t001">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper examined the stated plans for adaptation to health impacts of climate change in five examples of Med-cities. We found that all five cities addressed the major “rising temperatures” driver, particularly heatwaves. However, while policy tools that target heatwaves are an established, simple and efficient measure (e.g., [
  <a rid="B93-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-ijerph-13-00438">93</a>]), the plans we surveyed included fairly general notions of heat management. Urban design is another efficient measure to combat the rise of temperature in cities, but the cities studied used it randomly—one mentioned trees, another surface albedo, and a third city mentioned ventilation corridors, while all three of these examples of urban design are relevant to all five Med-cities we surveyed. Similarly, regarding the threat of flooding, four out of five plans addressed it, but one included sea level rise, stormwater discharge and green infrastructure; another focused on revitalizing blue infrastructure; and yet others focused on flood management and less on preventive infrastructure. Nevertheless, all five cities identified water supply and quality as a risk, and plan to reduce consumptions in different methods. All cities addressed vulnerable populations as a specific target population, and awareness and education as an overarching important component of adaptation, but with different foci.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We conclude that the five Med-cities with adaptation plans that we surveyed, and the relevant national adaptation plans and local health adaptation plans, address all the risks to health as identified in the local climate vulnerability assessments that were used [

  <a rid="B73-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B73-ijerph-13-00438">73</a>]. However, the policy tools to adapt to these risks differ greatly and depend on the local context. It remains a future task to examine whether the measures identified in the adaptation plans are indeed the best ways to reduce risks to human health.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recommendations</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, major international organizations have put forward recommendations for adaptation to climate change. For example, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction launched the global campaign “Making Cities Resilient—My City is Getting Ready!” to promote increased understanding and commitment by cities and local governments to risk reduction and to build cities that are resilient to disasters and climate change. The overall target of the campaign is to get as many cities as possible committed to disaster risk reduction and to span a global network of engaged cities and municipalities of different sizes, characteristics, risk profiles, and locations that can help and learn from one another [
   <a rid="B85-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-13-00438">85</a>,
   <a rid="B94-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijerph-13-00438">94</a>,
   <a rid="B95-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95-ijerph-13-00438">95</a>,
   <a rid="B96-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-ijerph-13-00438">96</a>]. Based on these recommendations, and on the health risks in Mediterranean urban environments, we suggest that Med-cities may consider adopting the following fields depending on their local needs and vulnerability chalenges: 
   <div list-type="order" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="italic">Assessment of health risks</span>: conduct risk assessments in order to identify the main threats to urban public health in a Mediterranean climate, and to maintain up-to-date data on risks and vulnerabilities, transparent to the citizens.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="italic">Extreme events management</span>: prepare comprehensive plans for extreme events, including early-warning systems. These plans should be cross-sectoral with a focus on vulnerable populations.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>
      <span class="italic">Long-term adaptation</span>: go beyond short-term preparedness for extreme events, and prepare for the longer-term changing climate over a 20 to 50-year span, although this is a challenge due to much shorter political time frames. Specifically: 
      <div list-type="alpha-lower" class="list">
       <div class="list-item">
        <p>
         <span class="italic">Strategic urban planning</span>: based on risk assessments—building regulations, land-use planning, revising master plans.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="list-item">
        <p>
         <span class="italic">Micro-climate</span>: long-term adaptation for a hotter climate is a special opportunity for Med-cities, which can contribute to the wellbeing of the urban population throughout the hot Mediterranean climate. Cities should increase the amount of shaded public spaces, using trees both with wide canopies and other shading elements. The shaded areas should include public squares, playgrounds, bus stops, pavements on main streets and rest areas in parks [

An initial step toward collaboration between Med-cities has been taken recently with the establishment of the “Mediterranean City Climate Change Consortium (MC-4)” [
      <a rid="B97-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-ijerph-13-00438">97</a>] that aims to coordinate efforts across political borders and disciplines to bring more resources and knowledge to building solutions for cities in the five Mediterranean-climate regions.
