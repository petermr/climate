 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated different cities (20,000 &lt; population &lt; 4,000,000) with a Mediterranean climate that have climate action plans, using the following methods: internet search of municipal websites, search of keywords in the University of Haifa Library Catalogue, Google search engine, Google scholar and websites of international organizations such as the United Nations and World Health Organizations (keywords: adaptation, climate change plan, climate action plan, climate change adaptation plan, CAP, climate change in cities). We searched in English, French and Spanish. We identified five Med-cities [

  <a rid="B37-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-13-00438">37</a>] with a comprehensive plan which refers to various aspects of expected health impacts of climate change: Adelaide, Australia; Barcelona, Spain; Cape Town, South Africa; Los Angeles (LA), United States and Santiago, Chile (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-00438-f001" href="#ijerph-13-00438-f001">Figure 1</a>). Each of these five large cities characterized by typical Mediterranean climate, serves as an example of one of the five Mediterranean-climate regions of the world [
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-13-00438">38</a>]. These five examples deal with similar vulnerability challenges related to climate change and health in a Mediterranean climate (such as heat stress, floods, drought, loss of biodiversity) which may be more complicated than in more extreme environments [
  <a rid="B27-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-13-00438">27</a>]. It is important to note that the climate of Santiago is slightly different (a “continental Mediterranean climate”) since it is not a coastal city but located about 100 km from the South Pacific Ocean at an elevation of ~520 m.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While these five cities published climate action plans, to the best of our knowledge, many other major Mediterranean climate cities, particularly in the Mediterranean basin, did not have such plans.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We analyzed each plan according to the climate change-related drivers of health impacts among city dwellers in the First Assessment Report of the Urban Climate Change Research Network [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-13-00438">20</a>]:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To this list, we added three policy aspects that the First Assessment Report identified as important for health-related urban adaptation: 
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">6.</span>
    <p>Protection of urban biodiversity and functioning ecosystems</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">7.</span>
    <p>Risks to vulnerable populations</p>
   </div>
   <div class="list-item">
    <span class="label">8.</span>
    <p>Education and raising awareness.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For each of the above health drivers and policy aspects, we examined whether it was identified as a local risk in municipal and national vulnerability assessments. We then identified the types of policy adaptation tools that address it in the urban climate adaptation plans. Since certain aspects of health adaptation, such as heat management and disease surveillance, are often not under the authority of municipalities, but rather the authority of local and national public health agencies, we searched for and analyzed also national adaptation plans and local health agencies adaptation plans, and added additional policy instruments found in these documents.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As for the limitations of this study, this is a desk study in which we surveyed municipal climate plans that were published online by municipalities. We did not have access to unpublished materials, and the plans were published between two to eight years ago. Moreover, it is likely that departments and officials take policy measures to adapt for health aspects of climate change at the municipal level beyond the measures detailed in the general climate plans of the municipality. It was also beyond the scope of this study to examine the impact on the adaptation policy of institutional mechanisms and decision-making processes, roles and capacities. This paper provides a preliminary mapping of health-related climate strategies at the municipal level in cities with Mediterranean climate, and identifies adaptation gaps in these strategic plans. It can serve as a basis for future work that will include empirical research in particular cities.</p>
