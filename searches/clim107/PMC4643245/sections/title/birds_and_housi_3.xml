 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All birds used in this study were reared and housed at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands (53° 13′ 0” N/6° 33′, 0” E). Birds were bred indoors in single housed pairs housed in 80 × 40 x 40 cm (I × h × d) cages with two perches, a wooden nestbox and abundant nesting material (hay). Food (tropical seed mixture), water, grit and cuttlebone were provided ad libitum. In addition the birds received one teaspoon of fortified canary food (“eggfood”, by Bogena, Hedel, the Netherlands) 3 times a week, until hatching of the first chick. Birds were cross-fostered when the oldest chick in a brood was 5 days old to broods that were either small (2 young, sometimes 3) or large broods (6 young, sometimes 5 or 7). Birds reared in a large brood attained lower body mass during growth and this effect persisted into adulthood (Briga 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> submitted). Young were removed from the parental cage when 35 days old and housed in indoor aviaries until they were entered in the experiment at 3–4 months of age.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adults were housed in eight large outdoor aviaries (L × H × W 310 × 210 × 150 cm) and subject to a foraging cost manipulation as described previously
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" href="#b60">60</a>. Briefly, in each aviary a food box was attached to the ceiling, with holes in the sides from which food (tropical seed mixture) could be obtained. In the easy foraging environment (4 aviaries) the food box has perches beneath the holes, while in the hard foraging environment these were removed (also 4 aviaries), forcing birds to fly and hover for seeds. Water (for drinking and bathing), grit and cuttlebone were provided ad libitum. In addition the birds received 1.25 g of fortified canary food (“eggfood”, by Bogena, Hedel, the Netherlands) per individual per week in three portions given on different days.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each aviary contained 15–30 birds of one sex (4 aviaries of each sex). To maintain numbers within a limited range, new birds were periodically added to replace dead birds. The first batch was 3–24 months old when the experiment started and variation in age when entering the experiment (‘AgeStart’) was therefore included as variable in all analyses. The first batch was kept in similar housing as in the experiment until the experiment started.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The foraging experiment was conducted from Dec 9
  <span class="sup">th</span> 2007 till Jan 1
  <span class="sup">st</span> 2013. During this period, 478 birds were entered in the experiment of which 285 died a natural death and 7 died an accidental death. In all analyses, accidental deaths and birds still alive were censored, but treating accidental deaths as natural deaths did not change the conclusions (results not shown).
