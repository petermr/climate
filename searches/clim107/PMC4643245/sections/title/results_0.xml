 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climatic data are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>. Estimating the time frame over which the climatic variables best explained mortality showed that the effects were most pronounced the day preceding the event (i.e. the survival or death of an individual), accounting for 77% and 15% of the weight for MinT and DTR respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). The time window over which MinT affected mortality was much shorter than DTR (8.9 &lt; ΔAICc &lt; 12.5, see methods for details on test). For MinT, (almost) 80% of the effect was captured the day before the event, while reaching 80% for DTR required 3 months (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Thus MinT had an immediate effect on bird mortality in comparison with DTR for which the effect was delayed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DTR and MinT both affected mortality but in an interaction, which received strong support: in both foraging environments all models within 4 AICc of the best fitting model contained the interaction between DTR and MinT (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). However, the sign of the interaction term depended on foraging environment (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S3</a>), which we discuss in more detail below. This three-way interaction (Treat*DTR*MinT) is well supported since it was included in all 14 best fitting models (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S3</a>). In the case of the best fitting model this interaction had a 
  <span class="italic">X</span> 
  <span class="sup">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </span>= 10.411, p = 0.0013, and removing it from the best fitting model decreased model fit by 9.2 AICc. Furthermore, all selected models contained an interaction between age and DTR, indicating a changing DTR effect with increasing age (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). Because in natural populations most birds are young, we here focus the presentation on young birds (but note that models in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a> are based on the complete data set). Details of age-specific changes are discussed in section 4 of the 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">supplementary material</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the easy foraging environment, the effect of DTR was most pronounced on cold days (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4A</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S4A</a>): birds experienced an up to ten-fold increase in mortality over the DTR range in our dataset. Evidence for this is robust since all selected models (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>) included DTR and the interaction between DTR and MinT. Thus, in the easy foraging environment, we found that large DTR increased mortality on cold days, but not on warm days.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the semi-natural foraging environment the evidence for an interaction between DTR and MinT was also robust: excluding the interaction decreased model fit with at least 3.3 AICc and models without the interaction all had weights ≤0.04 (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Note however that coefficients for the DTR*MinT interaction were in the opposite direction compared to the easy environment (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Indeed large DTR increased mortality on warm days, but not on cold days (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4B</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S4B</a>). Note that for DTR the coefficient in the best fitting model is larger in the semi-natural than in the easy environment on days with MinT of 6 °C, which is the mean MinT at our study location (2.04 vs. 1.36 respectively in the best fitting model). This implies an increase of 1 °C DTR has a stronger effect in the semi-natural than in the easy foraging environment (increases in mortality rate per °C DTR of 104% vs. 36% respectively). Thus in the semi-natural foraging environment large DTR increased mortality on warm days but not on cold days, opposite to the pattern in the easy foraging environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there is strong evidence that growing up in large broods negatively affects lifespan in the semi-natural environment (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>), there is little support for the hypothesis that brood size manipulation affects vulnerability to DTR in either environment (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DTR varied seasonally (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>), and the association between DTR and mortality can therefore be confounded with other climatic variables with similar seasonal variation as DTR. We captured the seasonal variation of climatic variables by adding photoperiod as a covariate to the best models of 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Tables S2, S3 and S4</a>. Photoperiod was in no case significant (0.23 &lt; 
  <span class="italic">X</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> &lt; 2.29, 0.13 &lt;p &lt; 0.63), never improved the model fit (0.3 &lt; ΔAICc &lt; 6), and the effect on the model coefficients of DTR, MinT or their interaction was negligible. We therefore conclude that DTR contributes to mortality independently of the seasonal variation of other (climatic) variables.
