  <div class="title">Cumulative weight functions (Weibull fits) that were best supported by the data.</div>
  <p>X-axis refers to time before the event (i.e. either survival or death of an individual) in days. Y-axis shows the cumulative weight or “influence” of the climatic variable on the event. For example for MinT, weights add up to 100% within 5 days, which means that all the minimum temperature of the 5 days prior to the event determine event outcome. For DTR the effect is delayed: 100% of the weight needs more than 3 months to accumulate. Horizontal dotted lines are reference lines at given weights.</p>
