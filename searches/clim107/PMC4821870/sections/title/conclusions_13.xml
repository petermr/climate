 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study is pivotal in providing direction for public health adaptation to climate change in Bangladesh. It is based on rich interview material from a large number of respondents living in poor and vulnerable communities. Results illustrate how marginalized populations are at risk of suffering from climate change–related health impacts and how the country's public health system needs to be adapted to climate change in the future.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The findings of this study indicate that there is a potential risk of climate change on human health. The magnitude of malaria, dengue, childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia is high among the vulnerable communities. Prevention and control of climate-sensitive diseases have to be addressed with area-specific interventions guided by local-level planning of the low-income vulnerable communities. Government initiatives, public–private strong advocacies, and international collaborations are needed to reduce OOP payments through alternative health care financing for climate victims. Climate change ultimately has an impact on health; therefore, public health care facilities at the community level should be prepared to be utilised to their full potential. The health system needs strategic interventions to cope with climate-sensitive health problems. Increasing the number of visits to public health facilities (10% visits to community clinics in this study) instead of to unqualified providers (45%) to cope with climate-induced health problems is a strategic challenge for policy makers. Community-based adaptation strategy for health could be beneficial for sectoral approach in ensuring sustainable development.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further studies are warranted to confirm shifting of vector- borne diseases such as malaria from endemic to non-endemic zones. Child-centred and school-based intervention studies could be explored to reduce seasonal childhood diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malnutrition A future cohort study, based on this survey, might allow public health scientists and policy makers to take effective measures to minimise climate change attributed health burden of Bangladesh and other developing countries as well.</p>
