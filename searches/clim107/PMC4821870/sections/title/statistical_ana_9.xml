 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Collected data were initially entered into computer using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21. Data were validated by a series of logical and range checks, producing summary statistics and tables. Data were immediately copied onto the hard disks of two computers as soon as data verification was completed and a copy was sent to the principal investigator at the University of Newcastle, Australia. Data were then transferred and analysed using STATA 13.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The summary statistics were reported as means, with standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables or percentages, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical variables. Socio-demographic variables and participants’ responses were summarized and presented using frequency tables. We estimated the incidence of climate-sensitive diseases (e.g. dengue, malaria) by fitting intercept only Poisson model using total number of household members as the offset. We estimated the incidence of different health events (e.g. diarrhoea) among under-five children adopting the same methods as described above using the total number of under-five children in each house as the offset. To adjust for the design effect of multistage sampling, we created sampling weights and incorporated them in the analyses using ‘svy’ command in Stata for all the analyses. We calculated sampling weights in four stages (i.e. the selection of upazila, union, village, and household) taking the inverse of the sampling fraction. The base weight was calculated by multiplying weights from all the four stages and was used in the ‘svy’ command.</p>
