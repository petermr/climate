 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthropogenic climate change represents a major threat to global biodiversity (Urban 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0069">2015</a>) and is causing strong ecological responses in many taxonomic groups across broad geographic areas (Parmesan 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0054">2006</a>). Species can avoid climate‐driven extinctions through three principle mechanisms: (1) individuals of a species can acclimate to changes in climate; (2) species can adapt to changing climatic conditions in situ; and/or (3) species can shift their ranges to follow the geographic displacement of suitable climate conditions (Feeley et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0018">2012</a>). For many taxa, acclimation seems unlikely given that the rapid pace and large‐magnitude of current climate change will quickly push climatic conditions beyond tolerable limits (Jump and Peñuelas 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0036">2005</a>). The remaining two options, species migration and adaptation, are not mutually exclusive and have occurred simultaneously in many species during past episodes of climate change (Davis and Shaw 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0014">2001</a>). However, given the inability of many species to evolve at the extremely rapid rates required to keep pace with contemporary climate change (Quintero and Wiens 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0057">2013</a>), the future of many species, and especially long‐lived species such as trees, will depend largely on their ability to shift their geographic ranges (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0022">2008</a>; Visser 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0071">2008</a>; Chen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0010">2011</a>; Hanski 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0027">2012</a> but see Skelly et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0501">2007</a>; Hoffmann and Sgro 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0500">2011</a>). Indeed, many species are already responding to climate change through geographic range shifts (Parmesan 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0054">2006</a>; Chen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0010">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By their very nature, species range shifts take place at range edges, and therefore, range‐edge populations play a critical role during climate‐driven range shifts. At the leading range edge (i.e., the expanding or colonizing edge), populations can act as important stepping stones by serving as dispersal‐foci or by maintaining unique genetic adaptations that promote colonization of newly suitable areas (Gibson et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0021">2009</a>; Hannah et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0026">2014</a>). At the trailing range edge (i.e., the contracting or retreating edge), populations often exhibit high degrees of local adaptation and contain unique genotypes that may be necessary to species' persistence under future climates (Hampe and Petit 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0025">2005</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biome boundaries, or ecotones, are defined by the convergence of many species' range edges and therefore represent geographic areas where locally‐adapted range‐edge populations are concentrated. Historically, many ecotones, such as those separating forests and savannahs or tundra, are also subject to high levels of human disturbance (Payette et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0055">2001</a>; Soares‐Filho et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>; Körner 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0041">2012</a>). For example, the highest rates of deforestation in the Amazon occur along the so‐called arc of deforestation at the frontier between the lowland forest and savannah/cerrado biomes, which by definition corresponds to the southerly range edge of many rainforest species (Soares‐Filho et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>). Similarly, alpine treelines representing the upper range edge of many montane species have been subject to human disturbance for millennia (Körner 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0041">2012</a>). Such geographically concentrated disturbances at ecotones may disproportionately remove range‐edge populations, impacting the overall ability of species' to persist during times of rapid climate change, and suggesting that these areas should be given greater prioritization as conservation targets.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The conservation value of range‐edge populations over evolutionary time scales has been well documented (Lesica and Allendorf 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0044">1995</a>; Hampe and Petit 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0025">2005</a>; Kawecki 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0037">2008</a>). Over shorter time scales, the role of range‐edge populations for determining species' responses to rapid anthropogenic climate change remains largely underappreciated (but see Gibson et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0021">2009</a>). Range‐edge populations may become even more valuable under future climates as growing human populations will almost certainly increase the rate of large‐scale land‐use changes (Soares‐Filho et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>) and accelerate climate change velocity (IPCC 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0034">2013</a>). Despite their potential importance, recent efforts highlight that conservation networks often fail to adequately protect genetically unique range‐edge populations (Lefévre et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0042">2013</a>; Schueler et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0063">2014</a>). It is clearly critical that we develop a more comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the synergies between disturbance at species' range edges and the ability of species to respond to climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we use conceptual models to illustrate the potential for the locally‐adaptive traits contained in range‐edge populations to confer relative fitness advantages and dictate the short‐term responses of species to novel climates. In developing our conceptual models, we focus on tree species as an exemplar group because of the foundational roles that these long‐lived species play in many ecosystems. The theoretical background and empirical evidence of local adaptations in range‐edge populations has been summarized elsewhere (Bridle and Vines 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0005">2007</a>; Eckert et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0015">2008</a>; Budd and Pandolfi 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0007">2010</a>). As such, our assumption is that local adaptations that may be beneficial under future climates are already present in wild populations and that these adaptations can be quite common, especially in trees (Savolainen et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0062">2007</a>; Aitken et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0001">2008</a>; Leimu and Fischer 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0043">2008</a>; Hereford 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0028">2009</a>; Alberto et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0002">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use two examples to illustrate how changes to climate coupled with habitat disturbance concentrated at areas where many species' range edges converge may be eliminating locally‐adapted populations that can be important for species' persistence under future climates. First, we discuss the cold range edges of tree distributions and the relationships between cold temperature events and future species distributions. In this example, we specifically discuss latitudinal and altitudinal treelines as they are distinct bioclimatic ecotones believed to be controlled by low temperature limitations on tree growth. In the second example, we focus on precipitation as the major determinant of species' distributions across lowland Amazonia as drought stress is known to greatly effect lowland tropical forest dynamics (Lewis et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0045">2011</a>). Given our heavy focus on tree species, caution should be taken when applying these conceptual models to other systems or taxonomic groups.
