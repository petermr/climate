 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the lowland tropics, temperature gradients are shallower than at higher latitudes (Wright et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0073">2009</a>). This means that across expansive lowland tropical forests, such as the Amazon, temperature remains relatively constant over very large geographic areas. In contrast, precipitation patterns can change markedly over much shorter distances and are believed to be a large driver of diversity and composition patterns throughout the lowland tropics (Engelbrecht et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0016">2007</a>). In lowland Amazonia, there is a distinct moisture gradient, with the south and southeastern Amazon being drier than areas to the west and north along the base of the Andes (Malhi and Wright 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0048">2004</a>). In addition to being drier, the southern Amazon experiences large seasonal fluctuations in rainfall with a distinct and extended dry season (Malhi and Wright 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0048">2004</a>). Over the last several decades, dry season length has increased in much of the southern Amazon, further intensifying moisture seasonality in this region leading to declines in forest vegetation (Hilker et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0030">2014</a>). Moreover, seasonality is expected to increase across the Amazon, with dry seasons becoming more pronounced and extreme drought events occurring more regularly, even in areas that are not currently affected by water shortages (Malhi et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0049">2009</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts had pervasive, long‐lasting negative effects on tree growth and survival throughout the Amazon (Phillips et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0056">2009</a>; Lewis et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0045">2011</a>; Saatchi et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0060">2013</a>). As drought frequency and severity increase under future climates, local adaptations to drought tolerance will be important in allowing tree species to sustain their distributions. Identifying where drought‐adapted populations currently exist will therefore increase our ability to predict how many Amazonian species will respond to future climate change.
 </p>
 <sec id="ece31645-sec-0005" class="sec">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where might drought‐adapted populations occur?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our understanding of intraspecific variation in drought tolerances in tropical trees is limited (McDowell et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0050">2008</a>; Craven et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0011">2013</a>). That said, it is reasonable to assume that many or most widespread Amazonian species exhibit some degree of local adaptation to moisture conditions given the ubiquity of genetic clines across temperature and moisture gradients in temperate species (Savolainen et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0062">2007</a>; McDowell et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0050">2008</a>). To highlight the potential for Amazonian plant species to exhibit local adaptations to moisture stress, we mapped the total annual precipitation (TAP; mm yr‐1) TAP (mm) and maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD; mm) across the distributions of 2157 widespread and large‐ranged tree species (estimated range size ≥300,000 km
   <span class="sup">2</span>) within the Amazon. MCWD is an integrative measure of the accumulative water stress experienced by plants in an area over the course of a year and has previously been found to be a strong predictor of species distributions as well as the location of humid tropical forests and other tropical biomes (Malhi et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0049">2009</a>). For a full description of the methods, see Data S1.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of MCWD values occurring within the distributions of widespread tree species' was a median of 321 mm (95% confidence interval: 29.8–523 mm; Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0002">2</a>A). Based on the geographic distribution of MCWD values in the Amazon, this corresponds to an estimated median range extent of more than 3000 km (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0002">2</a>B). Local adaptation to drought and summer moisture stress in populations of temperate species can be found over distances of just tens to hundreds of kilometers (Rehfeldt et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0058">1999</a>; St Clair et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0066">2005</a>). We found that Amazonian species experience large differences in MCWD across species' ranges, and that these differences occur over large geographic distances. Therefore, our findings support the contention that many of these tropical species are likely to maintain strong local adaptations to moisture stress conditions. More specifically, we predict that populations of widespread species that occur in the southern Amazon will be locally‐adapted to more extreme and/or prolonged drought conditions. If traits related to drought tolerance (e.g., water use efficiency) are limited to specific genotypes that are currently restricted to populations in the southern Amazon, then the individuals capable of persisting and populating the increasingly drier future Amazonian (Malhi et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0049">2009</a>) will likely originate from southern populations.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are we losing drought‐adapted populations?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The southern Amazon is widely known as “the arc of deforestation” due to large‐scale forest clearing for agricultural development (Soares‐Filho et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>). Beyond simply reducing total forest area, this geographically clustered deforestation may be having the additional negative effect of eliminating the populations that are best‐adapted to the dry and seasonal conditions that will be increasingly widespread in the future. To illustrate how deforestation relates to local climate, we mapped current total annual precipitation and MCWD across the Amazon (resolution of 2.5 arc min based on the WorldClim high‐resolution extrapolated climate database; Hijmans et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0029">2005</a>). We then overlaid areas that were mapped as being deforested as of 2002 and in areas that are predicted to be deforested by 2050 under a spatially explicit model of deforestation assuming business‐as‐usual (BAU) rates and constraints (Soares‐Filho et al. 
   <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>). These analyses clearly show that deforestation is currently occurring and is predicted to occur, predominantly in those areas that have lower annual precipitation (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0003">3</a>A, C) and higher seasonality of precipitation (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0003">3</a>B, D) such as the Amazon‐cerrado ecotone.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To help illustrate how deforestation in the southern Amazon could potentially hinder a species ability to adapt to future climate, we next mapped future climate analogs under the 2002 and 2050 BAU deforestation scenario (future precipitation and MCWD were based on six leading general circulation models at a resolution of 2.5 arc min with projections until 2070 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario; Fig. S1). Using the future climate (TAP and MCWD) predictions, we then identified and tallied the areas within the lowland Amazon forest that have analogous current climates. We then calculated the relative reduction (% decrease) in the number of current climate analogs corresponding to each cell due to the loss of area under current (2002) and predicted future (2050 BAU) deforestation.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that current deforestation reduces the extent of climate analogs (i.e., the extent of populations that will be available to populate future Amazonian forests) by an average of 16% (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0004">4</a>A) and that future deforestation will reduce the extent of climate analogs by an additional 36% (Fig. 
   <a rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0004">4</a>B). These results highlight the fact that because deforestation is occurring predominantly in the dry seasonal forest of the southern Amazon, and because the Amazon as a whole is predicted to become increasingly dry and seasonal, the effects of deforestation will extend well beyond its footprint. In other words, deforestation is reducing the number of drought‐resistant populations that can potentially immigrate into the increasingly widespread dry conditions that are analogous to conditions that are currently restricted to the southern Amazon.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses are meant to highlight the potential importance of range edge populations in trees and hence the danger of losing these populations through deforestation. The actual effects of deforestation on species persistence under climate change will be highly species‐specific and will depend on many different factors including the degree of local adaptation, the overlap between the species' geographic ranges and deforestation, and the species' dispersal ability, including the ability to cross‐disturbed/modified habitats (Feeley and Rehm
