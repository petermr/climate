<p class="p">Caribou avoided open water and selected ice during their fine-scale movements in the vicinity of, and across water bodies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The most parsimonious model performed especially well for a model that comprised only water and ice availabilities (

 </div> = 0.52). Interactions with water body type did not increase the goodness of fit, suggesting that caribou reacted similarly to large natural lakes, rivers, and reservoirs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Results from the annual SSF models were similar to the global model performed on all years (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Significant effects (i.e., selection for ice and avoidance of water) were uniform across years and for years with short (2010–2012) and long ice-availability windows (2007–2009 and 2013). Avoidance of water was significant during years with a long ice-availability period, and selection for ice was significant during years with a short ice-availability period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
