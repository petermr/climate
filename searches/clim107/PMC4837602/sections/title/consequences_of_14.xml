 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the potential consequences of climate change for migratory caribou by simulating future changes in ice phenology in our study area. For each year with caribou data (2007 – 2014), we advanced the average breakup date of the largest water bodies by 1-day increments, up to a 30-day change. We performed the same simulations in fall by delaying the average freeze date by 1-day increments for 30 days. At each increment, we determined the proportion of ice crossings that would not have been possible if breakup had been advanced or freezing had been delayed by 1 day. We then compared these simulations to various lake-ice cover projections made across North America [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. All projections were based on the high-emission A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the “business-as-usual” scenario [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]), but differed in their general circulation models. We calculated the mean predicted change in date for each projection (studies often reported a range of potential values or results from multiple climate models) and compared these values to our simulations. We used these projections to describe the potential availability of ice for caribou in our study area 25 – 50 years from now, i.e., in 2041–2070.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using these projections and our monitoring data, we estimated the additional distance required to circumvent water bodies in the future by isolating all ice crossings that would have become impossible (due to the absence of ice) and replacing them with simulated detours around water bodies. To do so, we simply isolated the first and last locations of ice crossings and generated new paths around water bodies, using the shortest route possible. We then compared the distance travelled by caribou during our study to the predicted distance obtained under potential future climate conditions. We compared distances between segments using paired 
  <span class="italic">t</span>-test and report the total difference in distance during the whole study. We did not generate detours from segments across rivers or leading to islands because finding an alternate route was often impossible.
