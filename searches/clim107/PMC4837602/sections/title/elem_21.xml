   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Temperatures are predicted to continue increasing in the future, and depending upon climate scenarios (see [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>] of changes in arctic environments suggest that freshwater ice availability in Northern Québec will likely decrease in the foreseeable future. In fact, based on various projections across northern North America [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>], as much as 36 % of ice crossings performed by caribou during the early spring and fall migrations would not have been possible if icing phenology had been comparable to conditions anticipated for the 2041 – 2070 horizon.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrary to Magnuson et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>], we did not detect any significant icing trend on the largest water bodies used by caribou in Northern Québec (2000–2014) and Lake Nichicun (1947–1985). This study was based on a different methodology and used data collected over much broader spatial (i.e., Northern Hemisphere) and temporal (i.e., 19
   <span class="sup">th</span> century onwards) scales. In comparison, our compilation of 15 years of MODIS data may have been insufficient to detect a significant trend. Broad scale predictive models usually outperform finer climatic models because of their capacity to capture a larger range of variability [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Other reports on local freshwater ice conditions have also demonstrated the difficulty of studying ice phenology at fine scales [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" href="#CR50">50</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>]. Latifovic and Pouliot [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>] found that, out of 36 lakes monitored across Canada from 1950 to 2004, 33 had earlier breakup and 24 had later freezing dates, but only 45 % and 42 % of these trends were statistically significant, respectively. The lack of additional long-term data on ice availability in our study area prevented us from performing more precise analyses.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou, water, and ice</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a consequence of a warming Arctic, caribou may encounter unfrozen lakes more frequently during their migrations. Ongoing research [M. Le Corre, C. Dussault, and S. D. Côté, unpublished observations] reveals that caribou in Northern Québec are initiating their spring and fall migrations earlier. This response may allow caribou to avoid a potential mismatch between the timing of migration and freshwater ice availability. Assuming caribou are unable to adjust the timing of their migrations further (e.g., see [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]), delays in ice phenology could force caribou to cross water bodies more frequently in open water or across ice too thin to bear their weight, causing increased risks of drowning [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Changes in ice phenology could also lead caribou to circumvent water bodies for several km, with possible negative consequences on their energy reserves. Considering that caribou rarely swam across unfrozen water bodies and frequently circumvented lakes for several km when ice was unavailable, the latter consequence seems likely.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou in Northern Québec seemed to favour ice substrates during migrations and winter displacements. Their movements in water were slower and more sinuous than their movements on ice. The relatively long “pauses” caribou often made on lake shores could have allowed them to assess the quality (i.e., thickness) of the ice before crossing [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. Caribou may also have used these “pauses” to feed and rest before or after crossing barren ice surfaces. Caribou made long excursions over frozen lakes, with the longest crossings exceeding 60 km. Reports of long journeys across ice by caribou and reindeer are not without precedent. Miller et al. ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" href="#CR57">57</a>] and references therein) described observations of reindeer walking on ice for several hundreds of km, including a 380 km trip by one individual over the Barents Sea. These authors also observed reindeer remaining on ice for &gt;25 km after land was easily accessible, suggesting that long trips across ice were not stressful for them. Based on the limited information about caribou swimming in the scientific literature, the longest water crossing we recorded was the longest ever reported (&gt;25 km vs. 3–10 km [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the individual that performed this water crossing used islands smaller than the minimum resolution of digital maps (i.e., 500 m) as stopover sites.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caribou swim at the water surface using quadrupedal paddling, which is amongst the least efficient types of swim in vertebrates [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. Few comparative data exist for running and swimming energetics in fully-terrestrial mammals. Mink (
   <span class="italic">Neovison vison</span>) spend 2.7 times more energy swimming compared to running [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" href="#CR59">59</a>]. To cover a given distance, humans spend approximately four times more energy in water than on land, and go half as fast [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" href="#CR60">60</a>]. It is probable that the comparative costs of swimming vs. running for caribou are similar to those of humans, if not higher, due to the low propulsive surface area of their finer limbs. Thus, the avoidance of water and selection of ice by caribou could be largely explained by locomotion energetics.
