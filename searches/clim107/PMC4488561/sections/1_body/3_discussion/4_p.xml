 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. It affects plant morphology by inhibiting stem elongation and leaf area expansion in many species subjected to elevated UV-B [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. UV-B radiation decreases photosynthetic activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and influences the functioning of plant protective mechanisms [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. This form of radiation interacts with other environmental factors, such as water stress, increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and the availability of nutrients [
 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Levels of these factors modulate the effects of UV-B, which in turn may affect plant responses to other environmental parameters [

 <xref rid="pone.0132326.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the light saturation point, net photosynthesis, photorespiration of
