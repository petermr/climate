A ROC curve shows the performance of a model whose output depends on a threshold parameter, it tests whether a model classifies species presence more accurately than random predictions. A perfect model has an AUC of 1, but performance is good when the AUC is &gt; 0.9 [

The SDM projections were calculated with Maxent software. We cross-checked future suitable habitat areas against the current distribution area of

  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> to identify regions that had become (i) unsuitable, (ii) suitable, and (iii) remained unchanged with respect to suitability; we then calculated and illustrated the areas of regions identified in (i)-(iii).
