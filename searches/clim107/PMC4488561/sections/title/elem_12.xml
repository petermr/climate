 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the 18 environmental variables annual mean temperature (Bio1), mean UV-B in the dullest month (UVB4), wet-day frequency (WET), and mean UV-B in the brightest month (UVB3) made the greatest contributions to the distribution model for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> relative to other variables. Annual mean temperature made the largest contribution (28.9%); the contributions of mean UV-B in the dullest month, wet-day frequency, and mean UV-B in the brightest month were 21.4%, 12.8%, and 10%, respectively. The cumulative contributions of these factors reached values as high as 73.1%. Thus, these four parameters were the major environmental variables we used for constructing the predicted distribution area of
