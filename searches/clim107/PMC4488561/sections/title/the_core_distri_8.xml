 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further examine the trend of suitable area changes, we also calculated and compared the centroids of future and current suitable areas by using a python-based GIS toolkit, SDMtoolbox [
  <a rid="pone.0132326.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132326.ref024">24</a>]. The SDMtoolbox calculates the distributional changes between two binary SDMs (e.g. current and future SDMs) [
  <a rid="pone.0132326.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132326.ref024">24</a>], and this analysis is focused on summarizing the core distributional shifts of the ranges of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span>. This analyses reduces species' distribution to a single central point (known as a centroid) and creates a vector file depicting magnitude and direction of predicted change through time. We examined the distributional shifts by tracking the changes in centroid changes among different SDMs.
