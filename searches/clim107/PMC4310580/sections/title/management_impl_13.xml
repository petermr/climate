 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The broad consensus in the literature is that climate change is likely to interact synergistically with biological invasions, leading to increasing economic and biodiversity impact (Walther et al. 
  <a rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" href="#b308">2009</a>; Scholes et al. 
  <a rid="b259" ref-type="bibr" href="#b259">2014</a>). Much evidence exists for recent changes in pest and disease distributions (Bebber et al. 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2013</a>), although substantial variation exists among taxa and geographic regions in the extent to which an overall increase in the burden of invasives under climate change might be expected (Bellard et al. 
  <a rid="b26" ref-type="bibr" href="#b26">2013</a>). A complicating factor is that human activity in the form of trade, transport and adaptation to climate change is likely to increase too. This will complicate decisions about range shifts relative to anthropogenic introductions and thus potentially confounding management decisions that are required to limit the overall burden of invasive species impacts. Even in relatively remote areas, these problems are playing out (Chown et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2012</a>). Overall, the prospects are for increased impacts of invasion as climate change proceeds (Scholes et al. 
  <a rid="b259" ref-type="bibr" href="#b259">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a management perspective, prevention, usually involving some form of risk assessment, is clearly the most cost-effective solution to invasions (Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" href="#b267">2013</a>). Therefore, considerable focus should be on prevention including the identification of the source and receiving areas for introductions (such as ports). Internationally, risk assessment is accepted as an essential policy instrument for managing biological risk. Risk is quantified by examining the invasiveness, impacts and potential distribution of species, areas which are all being improved by the adoption of genomic approaches. Thereafter (i.e. in a postborder context), substantial focus on interventions across the stages of invasion is critical for management success both in relation to typical population processes (such as those involved in emergence from lag phases) (Kueffer et al. 
  <a rid="b161" ref-type="bibr" href="#b161">2013</a>; Ricciardi et al. 
  <a rid="b235" ref-type="bibr" href="#b235">2013</a>; Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" href="#b267">2013</a>) and to changes in the environment associated with climate change and human adaptation to such change. Likewise, understanding when invasion success may be driven by factors other than climate change, such as local adaptation to climates, evolution of increased competitive ability and enemy release (Blossey and Notzold 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">1995</a>; Chun et al. 
  <a rid="b66" ref-type="bibr" href="#b66">2010</a>; Van Kleunen et al. 
  <a rid="b301" ref-type="bibr" href="#b301">2010</a>; Hill et al. 
  <a rid="b137" ref-type="bibr" href="#b137">2013</a>), is also important for managing invasions. Prioritization of management actions to species of greatest risk (Randall et al. 
  <a rid="b232" ref-type="bibr" href="#b232">2008</a>; Byrne et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2011</a>; Forsyth et al. 
  <a rid="b108" ref-type="bibr" href="#b108">2012</a>) is critical given the requirement for effective outcomes with investment of limited resources. As hybridization has been demonstrated to facilitate invasiveness, assessment of genetic risk is an important management tool (Byrne et al. 
  <a rid="b50" ref-type="bibr" href="#b50">2011</a>), particularly in the context of managed relocation as a climate change adaptation strategy (Schwartz et al. 
  <a rid="b260" ref-type="bibr" href="#b260">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout this review, we have demonstrated how genomics approaches can improve understanding, and in many cases forecasting, at each stage of invasion (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). These include better understanding of source areas and the identity of introduced species. In this sense, genomic approaches are typically improvements on genetic tools that have been available for sometime; they allow source populations to be identified more accurately, provide a clearer picture regarding multiple interactions, including the role of hybridization, and lead to better estimates of population size, gene flow and other processes. NGS techniques can provide ways of detecting invasive organisms that have previously not been available, and identifications become more accurate as additional sequence information is added. Microsatellite and mtDNA markers have been widely used to understand the population dynamics of agricultural pests and disease vectors in the past and thereby assisting in programs aimed at controlling pests and/or limiting their impact. However, the new genomic tools provide an unprecedented view of past and present population processes (e.g. Brown et al. 
  <a rid="b47" ref-type="bibr" href="#b47">2014</a>; Rasic et al. 
  <a rid="b233" ref-type="bibr" href="#b233">2014</a>). With invasion frequency increasing under climate change, these are all important tools in improving an understanding of invasion processes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where control of invasive species is being considered, genomic approaches can help in defining units for eradication and risks of reinvasion once eradication is achieved (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). At present, markers such as microsatellites are often used for defining movement patterns among populations of invasive pest mammals (e.g. Hampton et al. 
  <a rid="b130" ref-type="bibr" href="#b130">2004</a>; Abdelkrim et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2005</a>; Berry et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2012</a>; Adams et al. 
  <a rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" href="#b3">2014</a>). With the use of genomics approaches, managers should become much more confident of likely movement patterns and reinvasion potential as local movement patterns can be tracked much more accurately than in the past.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, genomics tools promise much more than ways of simply improving detection and an understanding of spread. High-density markers provide a way of tracking changes in different parts of the genome, essential for understanding hybridization and introgression as well as adaptation under climate change including the application of quantitative genomic approaches to identify regions with candidate genes (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). This can be used to understand the roles of various evolutionary processes at key steps of the invasion pathway, and the ways in which climate change will interact with the latter. Key areas include investigation of evolutionary change underpinning increased competitive ability and enemy release, especially in a biological control context. Genomics methods can also help redirect resources by improving understanding of the burden of invasion, an especially important role as that burden increases (e.g. Pfenninger et al. 
  <a rid="b216" ref-type="bibr" href="#b216">2014</a>). They can assist with rehabilitation in the case where substantial invasive impacts result in widespread ecosystem changes, by understanding patterns of resistance and identifying resistant genotypes that can persist into the future. For example, where trees are affected by introduced pathogens, there is the possibility of identifying tree genotypes that survive outbreaks (Stukely and Crane 
  <a rid="b278" ref-type="bibr" href="#b278">1994</a>; McKinney et al. 
  <a rid="b191" ref-type="bibr" href="#b191">2014</a>). As information becomes available on adaptive changes in traits controlling the spread and climate change adaptation, it should also be possible to refine models about the non-native range of an invasive species. For instance, Kearney et al. (
  <a rid="b154" ref-type="bibr" href="#b154">2009</a>) modelled the expected range of 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> in northern Australia based on anticipated evolutionary changes in egg desiccation tolerance under climate change and showed the potential threat posed by this species around a population centre.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, genomic tools are proving to be extremely useful for managing invasive species. While they may be seen as costly for less well-resourced nations, several studies have demonstrated that they are more cost-effective than traditional surveillance tools and other methods. Moreover, technology is now advancing to the stage where users do not need to be familiar with its intricacies (in much the same way, most mobile phone users could not build one), and substantial programmes of technology assistance are in place through various international agencies (such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cgiar.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.cgiar.org</span>). In consequence, the myriad ways genomic tools can be utilized will enable society to contain the economic cost of biological invasions accentuated by climate change, and prevent a world dominated by weedy species.
