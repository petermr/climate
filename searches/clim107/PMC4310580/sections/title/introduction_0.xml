 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biological invasions constitute a major environmental change driver, affecting conservation, agriculture and human health. Invasive alien species (IAS) impacts include, alterations of ecosystem features such as hydrology, fire regimes, food webs, soil nutrients and nutrient cycling (Hänel and Chown 
  <a rid="b131" ref-type="bibr" href="#b131">1998</a>; Asner and Vitousek 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2005</a>; Van Wilgen 
  <a rid="b302" ref-type="bibr" href="#b302">2009</a>; Veldtman et al. 
  <a rid="b305" ref-type="bibr" href="#b305">2011</a>); negative effects on populations (Blackburn et al. 
  <a rid="b32" ref-type="bibr" href="#b32">2004</a>; Butchart et al. 
  <a rid="b49" ref-type="bibr" href="#b49">2010</a>; Ziska et al. 
  <a rid="b335" ref-type="bibr" href="#b335">2011</a>); facilitation of further invasion and its associated impacts (O'Dowd et al. 
  <a rid="b209" ref-type="bibr" href="#b209">2003</a>); changes to evolutionary trajectories, such as by hybridization (McDonald et al. 
  <a rid="b189" ref-type="bibr" href="#b189">2008</a>); and evolutionary shifts in species responding to the new introductions (Strauss et al. 
  <a rid="b277" ref-type="bibr" href="#b277">2006</a>). Much attention has therefore been given to understanding the invasion process. A broadly accepted perspective on biological invasions now exists that distinguishes the stages of invasion and the mechanisms that are involved in each stage (Blackburn et al. 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the field has grown rapidly (Mooney and Hobbs 
  <a rid="b200" ref-type="bibr" href="#b200">2000</a>; Sax et al. 
  <a rid="b254" ref-type="bibr" href="#b254">2005</a>; Richardson 
  <a rid="b237" ref-type="bibr" href="#b237">2011</a>; McGeoch et al. 
  <a rid="b190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b190">2012</a>; Spear et al. 
  <a rid="b273" ref-type="bibr" href="#b273">2013</a>), several significant challenges remain. Foremost among these is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying each of the key transitions in the invasion process, reflected by periodic calls for additional work in these areas (e.g. Puth and Post 
  <a rid="b227" ref-type="bibr" href="#b227">2005</a>; Hulme et al. 
  <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2008</a>). Most recently, attention has turned to the quantification and forecasting of IAS impacts. Several reviews have concluded that current knowledge and capability in this area are inadequate, rendering management responses either ineffective or inefficient (Pyšek et al. 
  <a rid="b229" ref-type="bibr" href="#b229">2012</a>; Hulme et al. 
  <a rid="b147" ref-type="bibr" href="#b147">2013</a>; Ricciardi et al. 
  <a rid="b235" ref-type="bibr" href="#b235">2013</a>; Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" href="#b267">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Further challenges are presented by the simultaneous increase in the impacts of other environmental change drivers. Biological invasions (e.g. Lambdon et al. 
  <a rid="b162" ref-type="bibr" href="#b162">2008</a>; Chown et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2012</a>; Richardson and Ricciardi 
  <a rid="b240" ref-type="bibr" href="#b240">2013</a>) are not the only forms of change increasing in frequency and extent. Climate change, as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is continuing, with indications that the rate of change may be increasing owing to a rise in CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions (Rignot et al. 
  <a rid="b244" ref-type="bibr" href="#b244">2011</a>). Similarly, landscapes continue to change through human interventions (Barnosky et al. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2012</a>). Exploitation is ongoing with apparently little abatement, resulting in substantial population declines, even within protected areas (Chown 
  <a rid="b62" ref-type="bibr" href="#b62">2010</a>; Craigie et al. 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2010</a>; Jackson 
  <a rid="b148" ref-type="bibr" href="#b148">2010</a>; Laurance et al. 
  <a rid="b164" ref-type="bibr" href="#b164">2012</a>). While some forms of pollution have declined notably, others have come to replace these (Sutherland et al. 
  <a rid="b279" ref-type="bibr" href="#b279">2010</a>, 
  <a rid="b280" ref-type="bibr" href="#b280">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the form of the interactions between biological invasions and these other environmental change drivers has yet to be fully generalized (Darling and Côté 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2008</a>; Bradley et al. 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">2010</a>; Treasure and Chown 
  <a rid="b295" ref-type="bibr" href="#b295">2014</a>), the current view is that interactions are likely most often to be synergistic (Brook et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2008</a>; Walther et al. 
  <a rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" href="#b308">2009</a>). Moreover, the simultaneous effects of environmental change drivers on indigenous species, and human responses to counter at least some of the effects of environmental change, such as through managed relocation (Schwartz et al. 
  <a rid="b260" ref-type="bibr" href="#b260">2012</a>), are likely to make management decisions about biological invasions much more difficult than in the past (Webber and Scott 
  <a rid="b312" ref-type="bibr" href="#b312">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The field of invasion science has recognized many of these challenges and research directions are clearly changing to meet them (McGeoch et al. 
  <a rid="b190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b190">2012</a>; Ricciardi et al. 
  <a rid="b235" ref-type="bibr" href="#b235">2013</a>; Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" href="#b267">2013</a>). Much of this new work remains ecological in nature (at the organismal, population, species or ecosystem levels), including work that aims to guide management interventions to address the impacts of biological invasions (Richardson and Pyšek 
  <a rid="b239" ref-type="bibr" href="#b239">2012</a>; Blackburn et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2014</a>). Nonetheless, from early on in the development of the field, several other approaches have been considered. Among these, the utility of genetics and the significance of evolutionary processes have long been recognized (e.g. Baker 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1974</a>). However, it is only recently that they have seen a resurgence of interest (Huey et al. 
  <a rid="b143" ref-type="bibr" href="#b143">2000</a>; Callaway and Maron 
  <a rid="b51" ref-type="bibr" href="#b51">2006</a>; Dormontt et al. 
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">2011</a>; Lawson Handley et al. 
  <a rid="b166" ref-type="bibr" href="#b166">2011</a>). Indeed, the significance of genetic approaches and an evolutionary perspective are now recognized as important not only for understanding the ability of species to progress along the stages of invasion (e.g. Pandit et al. 
  <a rid="b212" ref-type="bibr" href="#b212">2011</a>; Richardson and Pyšek 
  <a rid="b239" ref-type="bibr" href="#b239">2012</a>), but also for improving management interventions that might reduce the rates and impacts of invasions (Lawson Handley et al. 
  <a rid="b166" ref-type="bibr" href="#b166">2011</a>; Prentis and Pavasovic 
  <a rid="b224" ref-type="bibr" href="#b224">2013</a>). Examples include better genotypic matching of biocontrol agents and their hosts, and understanding the coevolutionary dynamics of invasive species and those with which they interact (Phillips and Shine 
  <a rid="b217" ref-type="bibr" href="#b217">2006</a>; McDonald et al. 
  <a rid="b189" ref-type="bibr" href="#b189">2008</a>; Gaskin et al. 
  <a rid="b117" ref-type="bibr" href="#b117">2011</a>). Nonetheless, additional scope exists for modern genetic approaches, and notably genomics, to contribute to the understanding and forecasting that is required to limit the rates and impacts of biological invasions, especially given the expectation of interactions with other global change drivers.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we focus on the use of genomics to understand the changing form of invasion with climate change. We briefly review the contributions that genetic and evolutionary approaches have already made, discuss recent technological developments and then highlight further potential of this approach. We base our overview on the unified framework for biological invasions (Blackburn et al. 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2011</a>), recognizing that each of the stages in the invasion process can be mitigated by an accompanying management response (Fig.
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" href="#fig01">1</a>). In addition, although various views exist about how invasive species should be defined (Pyšek et al. 
  <a rid="b228" ref-type="bibr" href="#b228">2004</a>; Valéry et al. 
  <a rid="b299" ref-type="bibr" href="#b299">2008</a>), here, to avoid uncertainty (McGeoch et al. 
  <a rid="b190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b190">2012</a>), we adopt the definition provided by Richardson et al. (
  <a rid="b241" ref-type="bibr" href="#b241">2011</a>). In consequence, we are concerned with the processes by which species are transported outside their natural range through direct or indirect anthropogenic intervention and become established, proliferate and interact with the biota in their new ranges.
