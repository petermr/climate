 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the link between phenotypic plasticity and distribution has not been comprehensively supported (Dawson et al. 
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">2012</a>), phenotypic plasticity clearly contributes to environmental tolerance in various ways (e.g. Ghalambor et al. 
  <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2007</a>; Des Marais et al. 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">2013</a>; Schilthuizen and Kellermann 
  <a rid="b257" ref-type="bibr" href="#b257">2014</a>). Moreover, at least under conditions of resource abundance, it appears that invasive species do show greater plasticity than their indigenous counterparts (Davidson et al. 
  <a rid="b79" ref-type="bibr" href="#b79">2011</a>), although the way in which such comparisons should be made has been the subject of much recent discussion (Van Kleunen et al. 
  <a rid="b301" ref-type="bibr" href="#b301">2010</a>; Leffler et al. 
  <a rid="b173" ref-type="bibr" href="#b173">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Phenotypic plasticity plays a significant role in the responses of both plants and animals to environmental change (De Witt and Scheiner 
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">2004</a>; Ellers and Stuefer 
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">2010</a>; Nicotra et al. 
  <a rid="b207" ref-type="bibr" href="#b207">2010</a>). The extent to which plasticity promotes longer-term adaptation may vary, however, ranging from cases where it promotes adaptation through to those where it might inhibit adaptation. The outcome depends on a range of circumstances, including the extent and form of environmental predictability, the extent of dispersal and the genetic variance in new environments (Chown and Terblanche 
  <a rid="b63" ref-type="bibr" href="#b63">2007</a>; Ghalambor et al. 
  <a rid="b120" ref-type="bibr" href="#b120">2007</a>; Scoville and Pfrender 
  <a rid="b261" ref-type="bibr" href="#b261">2010</a>; Chevin et al. 
  <a rid="b60" ref-type="bibr" href="#b60">2013</a>). Nonetheless, currently, it appears that phenotypic plasticity can play a major role in species responses to climate change, such as in changing the timing of breeding in birds (Gienapp et al. 
  <a rid="b122" ref-type="bibr" href="#b122">2008</a>) and responses of plants along climate gradients (Matesanz and Valladares 
  <a rid="b186" ref-type="bibr" href="#b186">2014</a>; McLean et al. 
  <a rid="b192" ref-type="bibr" href="#b192">2014</a>). Some evidence also exists suggesting that invasive species have advantages over indigenous ones as a consequence either of the extent or form of their plasticity (Stachowicz et al. 
  <a rid="b274" ref-type="bibr" href="#b274">2002</a>; Chown et al. 
  <a rid="b64" ref-type="bibr" href="#b64">2007</a>; Kleynhans et al. 
  <a rid="b159" ref-type="bibr" href="#b159">2014</a>). Given that at least some evidence supports the idea that phenotypic plasticity may enhance the success of nonindigenous species as climates change, an understanding of the genomic basis of plasticity may improve forecasts of where such advantage should be expected and what form it should take.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genomic and transcriptomic basis of variation in phenotypic plasticity is still poorly understood. Several gene expression studies have now been undertaken across related species or populations exposed to different environmental conditions to assess whether these might provide clues about the mechanistic basis of variability in plastic responses (Smith et al. 
  <a rid="b271" ref-type="bibr" href="#b271">2013</a>; Dunning et al. 
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">2014</a>; Meier et al. 
  <a rid="b194" ref-type="bibr" href="#b194">2014</a>). A few of them have considered populations from native and invaded parts of their range to assess whether there are differences in plastic responses to the different environmental conditions encountered in invasive situations. For instance, in sticklebacks, the invasion of freshwater environments by marine populations has involved an increase in expression plasticity, including some genes that are thought to be involved in adaptation to these new habitats (Morris et al. 
  <a rid="b202" ref-type="bibr" href="#b202">2014</a>), while in 
  <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> populations from warm environments, there was an enrichment of down-regulated genes when flies were raised in conditions that were not commonly encountered in their native range (Levine et al. 
  <a rid="b175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b175">2011</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A challenge is to link these expression changes to adaptive variation in plasticity; population differences in gene expression under different conditions may indicate adaptive changes in plasticity, but expression changes have not yet been clearly linked mechanistically to such changes. One problem in making such connections is that there is a level of complexity in organism's transcriptome that largely remains to be explored even in model organisms. For instance, in 
  <span class="italic">D. melanogaster,</span> the transcriptome can be modified qualitatively in a variety of ways, such as through alternative splicing and expression of alternative isoforms, that may ultimately have more impact on plastic responses than quantitative changes in gene expression. These sources of variation for climate adaptation are only just starting to be explored (Telonis-Scott et al. 
  <a rid="b288" ref-type="bibr" href="#b288">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another challenge is to consider plastic changes across generations as well as within them. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications can be induced by environment and influence gene expression and transposable element activity, with direct effects on the phenotype (Glastad et al. 
  <a rid="b123" ref-type="bibr" href="#b123">2011</a>; Herrera et al. 
  <a rid="b135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b135">2012</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="b332" ref-type="bibr" href="#b332">2013c</a>). In plants, methylation can also be inherited through multiple generations, thus partly acting like heritable genetic variation. There are several examples of invasive species where epigenetic variation far exceeds standing genetic variation (Richards et al. 
  <a rid="b236" ref-type="bibr" href="#b236">2012</a>; Liebl et al. 
  <a rid="b177" ref-type="bibr" href="#b177">2013</a>). Genomics is integral to the field of ecological epigenetics. Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing can reconstruct entire methylation profiles (Schmitz et al. 
  <a rid="b258" ref-type="bibr" href="#b258">2013</a>; Wang et al. 
  <a rid="b310" ref-type="bibr" href="#b310">2013</a>) while reduced-representation genomic methods and genetic methods such as MS-AFLP can enable quantification of the extent of epigenetic compared to genetic variation within and among populations (Pérez et al. 
  <a rid="b215" ref-type="bibr" href="#b215">2006</a>). The hypothesis that epigenetic variation is important to invasion in some cases is intriguing, and a handful of studies exist directly linking epigenotype to phenotypic means, plasticities and environmental tolerance (Herrera et al. 
  <a rid="b135" ref-type="bibr" href="#b135">2012</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="b332" ref-type="bibr" href="#b332">2013c</a>), but in general, few data have been collected that examine adaptive and heritable epigenetic effects (Furrow and Feldman 
  <a rid="b111" ref-type="bibr" href="#b111">2014</a>).
