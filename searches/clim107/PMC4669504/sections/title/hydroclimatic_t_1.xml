 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Change-point and trend analysis (Methods) of 96 selected watersheds are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>. Out of 60 non-RHBN (Reference Hydrometric Basin Network) watersheds, the streamflow and PET of 41 watersheds and the precipitation of 45 watersheds shows statistically significant change-points. However, for 36 RHBN watersheds, the corresponding number of watersheds decreases to 9 and 2 respectively, mainly because of pristine land-use conditions of RHBN watersheds. Change-points of streamflow data are mainly detected around 1929–1997 (mean 1969) and 1977–2004 (mean 1991) for non-RHBN and RHBN stations, respectively. Therefore, we adopt 1990 as the change point year for RHBN stations. However, for non-RHBN stations, because data begins no later than 1960, we adopt 1980 as the change point year to ensure sufficient length of data before and after change points. By adopting a common change point year for non-RHBN and RHBN stations, we have a better basis to compare the attribution results between different non-RHBN and RHBN watersheds.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From periods-1 to -2, the annual streamflow generally decreased (0–81 mm) along the Canadian Rockies (CR) which are Boreal and Montane Cordillera shown in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a>) but increased (0–58 mm) elsewhere, and 35 non-RHBN in mid- and eastern Canada, and 3 RHBN watersheds show statistically significant increasing trends between 1940 s-2010 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). However, depending on the periods considered (30-, 40- and 50-year), some RHBN streamflow data in southern Canada showed significant decreasing trends
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>, but most showed insignificant decreasing trends between 1970–2010.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Change-points of annual precipitation (PET) occurred in about 1955 (1950) and 1992 (1989) for non-RHBN and RHBN watersheds, respectively. Annual precipitation has increased 5–35% in southern Canada over 1990–1998
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>, and abrupt changes often happened earlier in western than in eastern watersheds (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>). For non-RHBN watersheds, differences in detected change-points between streamflow and climate data can be attributed to human activities. From periods-1 to -2, changes to the mean annual precipitation range from -44 to 158 mm, with a significant decrease in central CR and northern Canada but a significant increase in southern Canada. Most British Columbia (BC) and northern Canada showed an increase (0–30 mm) in the mean annual PET, but southern Canada generally a decrease (0–18 mm) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>), while 
  <span class="italic">n</span> had generally increased in southern but some had decreased in northern watersheds of Canada (
