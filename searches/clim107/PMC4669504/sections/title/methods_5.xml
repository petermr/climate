 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From analyzing the 1961–2010 annual water balance of 370 watersheds using streamflow data of Water Survey Canada (WSC), Wang, 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" href="#b38">38</a> found that large spatial variabilities of basin-scale water budget over Canada, and some significant discrepancies in the water budget of some watersheds in northern Canada (above 60°N) were partly due to mass loss of glaciers. Given the Budyko framework is meant for the long-term (&gt;1 year) water balance analysis, 96 Canadian watersheds with drainage area &gt;2,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> and an annual water imbalance &lt;10% of the annual precipitation were selected for this study.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since available streamflow data is less complete than precipitation and temperature data, only watersheds with long-term streamflow data were selected in this study. The RHBN streamflow data of WSC have been extensively used for climate change studies, since RHBN data are characterized by relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions (&lt;5% of the land surface modified) with at least 20 years of record. A total of 36 RHBN watersheds with daily streamflow data of 1971–2010 were selected for this study. Further, daily streamflow data of 60 non-RHBN stations that began no later than 1960 were also selected for this study (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">S2</a>). In this study, the total annual depth of streamflow was estimated for station drainage areas while the total annual values of other hydroclimatic variables were estimated for actual watershed areas. Next, the gridded, monthly precipitation dataset
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" href="#b39">39</a>, and the monthly PET dataset of CRU TS v. 3.22
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" href="#b40">40</a> were also used under the Budyko framework. To estimate the change in SR over watersheds, we used the NARR
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" href="#b41">41</a> snowfall and precipitation data over 1979–2014. Abrupt changes in the mean hydroclimatic data due to climatic changes and/or anthropogenic effects were detected using the nonparameteric Pettitt test
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" href="#b42">42</a>, monotonic trends was investigated by the Mann-Kendall (MK) test
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" href="#b43">43</a>, and magnitudes of trend were estimated using the Theil–Sen approach
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" href="#b44">44</a>, at 10% significance level.

Hydroclimatic changes from periods-1 to -2 were estimated for the 96 watersheds. The contributions of human impacts to observed changes in MAS of Canada were assessed in terms of population density, dam distribution, and land uses (
