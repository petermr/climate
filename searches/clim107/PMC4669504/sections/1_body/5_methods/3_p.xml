<p class="p">Various significant hydroclimatic change-points for Canada, mainly between 1970–1990, have been detected
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. We first divided RHBN (non-RHBN) streamflow datasets into pre-1990 (pre-1980) and post-1990 (post-1980) parts, respectively. Hydroclimatic changes from periods-1 to -2 were estimated for the 96 watersheds. The contributions of human impacts to observed changes in MAS of Canada were assessed in terms of population density, dam distribution, and land uses (
