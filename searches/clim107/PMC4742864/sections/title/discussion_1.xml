 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change inequity is globally pervasive, and correlated with economic output. Some countries, such as China and the United States of America, are in a win-win position of achieving economic growth through fossil fuel use with few consequences from the resulting climate change, while many other, mostly Island and African, countries suffer low economic growth and severe, negative climate change impacts (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S4</a> online). The beneficiaries of this climate inequity have few incentives to meaningfully reduce or halt their GHG emissions. Despite many of the broad issues around climate equity being well known
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1</a>, well-funded global mechanisms that are being implemented still do not exist. This has serious consequences for our ability to slow the rate of climate change, and reduce the wellbeing implications for forced rider countries.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several global policy frameworks currently being debated that could address elements of the problem. The Paris Agreement
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>, secured at the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP21), for example, sets an ambitious target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. However, the 160 indicative nationally determined contributions (INDCs) pledges submitted by signatories to the UNFCCC prior to COP21
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>, indicate that current targets for GHG emissions are unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a> With no binding agreement established at COP21 for INDCs, there is no clear indication of how successful the Paris Agreement will be
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. Addressing GHG emissions is clearly an important first step in ensuring the burden of climate change is not amplified in the future. However, the historic commitment to GHG emissions reduction by key free riders has been slow. Only 50 countries ratified the previous Doha Amendment to the Kyoto protocol, which did not include key free riders such as the United States and Russia
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. Furthermore, some countries have actually backtracked on their commitments to emissions reductions (e.g. Canada and Australia)

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Likewise, the Paris Agreement calls for urgent and adequate financing of US$100 billion per year by 2020 for climate mitigation and adaptation through the Financial Mechanism of the Convention (FMC)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. However, there is no legally binding mechanism under which parties are responsible for providing this funding. History suggests such funding goals are not always met. For example, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2010 under the UNFCCC to mobilise funding support for the least developed countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, yet it remains poorly funded, with only US$10.2 billion received in pledges by November 2015
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. Addressing these issues around climate funding will play a critical role in addressing climate inequity
