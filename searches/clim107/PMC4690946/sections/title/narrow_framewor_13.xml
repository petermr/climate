  <span class="italic">Narrow Framework Limits Work on Root Causes of Climate and Health</span> 
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because many of the actions to address climate change include efforts to address systems change (e.g., transportation), respondents in both public health groups voiced a need for stronger public health practice on upstream prevention and the social determinants of health, such as food systems, active transportation, healthy housing, and the built environment, as well as more training and resources for that work. A “PH non-engaged” respondent explained: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Most of what we do as a public health department is service delivery. Prevention—which is what climate change work is—is a very tiny part of what we do.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A “PH engaged” participant agreed: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“So many public health departments are still entrenched in how funding is coming, silos, disease conditions, and individual behavior change. Those local health departments that are at least looking at neighborhood conditions will be better off. Climate change is still pretty far out.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recognition that climate change is complex and requires a sustained commitment led respondents to express frustration at a 
  <span class="italic">“reactive”</span> public health practice dominated by the 
  <span class="italic">“tyranny of the urgent”</span>. “PH engaged” respondents stressed that in order to work on climate change, public health will have to shift its resources and attention from service provision to systems changes: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Other things will have to go and be shifted to someone else’s responsibility so that public health can do its work at the broad population level…and focus on the macro-level changes that are needed.”</p>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A “PH engaged” respondent stressed that the root causes of climate change should be the focus, even beyond mid-stream environmental exposures: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“The focus on the air pollution benefits is myopic. That’s another challenge for public health: Even within the EPA, everything is organized according to a disease outcome or a health issue. Climate is a large problem that requires systems thinking. If we limit the conversation only to (air pollution), that’s short sighted without thinking about underlying issues.”</p>
