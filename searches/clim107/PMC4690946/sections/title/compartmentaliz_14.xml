  <span class="italic">Compartmentalization within and across Sectors</span> 
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to work on systems changes, public health will need to work effectively across public health programs, and across other sectors. Compartmentalization and lack of coordination across funding streams prevents work on cross-cutting issues like climate change and health. Respondents from all groups note that the silos become more challenging when working across sectors, given organizational barriers and differences in language, approach, and priorities: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“We don’t understand each other at all. We’re in different disciplines; don’t have knowledge of their expertise, different language, and different emphasis on what’s important. It takes twice as much work; you have to get a rudimentary understanding of what they’re doing. Some ways to get over that is willingness to spend a little more time making sure people understand each other.”</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One “PH engaged” government worker described territorial conflicts over climate change: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“There’s still a sense that public health shouldn’t be in the room because things are not a health initiative. But all public agencies should be responsible to the public and part of that is keeping them safe and healthy. There are turf issues, especially with infrastructure agencies, transit authority, or pollution-planning.”</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another “PH engaged” participant described: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“Air pollution control district and planning are strong partners, but we still tend to get siloed, and they still think climate change is theirs. They all talk ‘health’, but don’t invite health to the table. (X University) organized a state-wide conference, and health was a major topic on the agenda, but they never invited (local health department) to the conference.”</p>
