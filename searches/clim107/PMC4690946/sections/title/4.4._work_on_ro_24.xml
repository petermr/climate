 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The way that agencies and programs are funded and organized within public health presents a significant barrier because addressing climate change requires work on multiple systems that both cause climate change and public health problems. Unfortunately due to norms of practice within the field and bureaucratic and political constraints from larger systems, work on climate change within health tends towards a narrow framework for practice, limited capacity due to a decimated public health infrastructure, funding, and workforce expertise, lack of formal power and informal leadership, and compartmentalization within public health and in most other governmental agencies necessary for effective partnership in forming systemic solutions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Work that addresses the determinants of both health inequities and climate change provides perhaps the best opportunity to improve those systems that cause climate change, poor health, and inequities through myriad pathways. Failure to make explicit the links between community health promotion, health equity, and climate change mitigation and adaptation represents missed opportunities to inform and activate citizens to demand more action on climate change, and to inform decision-makers about opportunities to optimize health and equity or minimize harms. For example, while hundreds of municipalities around the nation are developing climate action plans, few are explicitly engaging or integrating health and equity, thus missing opportunities to prevent harms and optimize health and equity co-benefits [

The lessons we learn from work at the nexus of climate change and health are useful to understanding how to advance other work on social determinants of health. As respondents described in the barriers section, public health practice that remains focused on a biomedical model will miss those opportunities.
