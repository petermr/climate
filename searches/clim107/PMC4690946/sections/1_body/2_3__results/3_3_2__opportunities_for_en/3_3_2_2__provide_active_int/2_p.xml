  <p class="p">“With health and adaptation, it’s still complicated for a planner to understand. We understand extreme heat events, but I don’t have a background in terms of thresholds and what numbers matter. It’s still hard for me to understand what the community impact will be. I couldn’t go the next step and say the risk for my community in terms of health is this. Public health can make that data more accessible to planners like me.”</p>
