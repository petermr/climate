  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> shows the socioeconomic indicators related to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The indicators related to human capital, family structure, physical infrastructure, economic capability, socially vulnerable groups, demographics, and employment come from the National System of Indicators (SNI in Spanish) (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sni.gob.ec" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.sni.gob.ec</span>). The SNI contains data from several national-level census and surveys administered in Ecuador. Housing tenure and housing characteristics information comes from the 2010 National Population and Household Census. Institutional capacity indicators are constructed based on the 2010 Census for the Management, Expenditures and Investment on Environmental Protection at Municipalities and Provincial Councils. Agricultural information such as the proportion of agricultural land with respect to total area, the proportion of agricultural land with irrigation, as well as tenure of agricultural land comes from the 2010 National Agricultural Census. Information about medical doctors and staff comes from the 2009 Health Resources and Activities Census.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To construct the institutional capacity indicator we apply polychoric principal component analysis to a set of variables related to whether the canton has developed information, programs, strategies or policies on: (1) environmental sensitivity assessments; (2) environmental development; (3) pollution management; and (4) climate change. Though these programs and policies are not uniform across cantons, their availability and extent are an input for the management of climate-related hazards and other environmental risks. Thus, the institutional indicator and its weight signal that in Ecuador the capacities and the relative institutional development of the cantons play a significant role in terms of resource management to cope with changing climatic conditions. We also include the per capita funds municipalities allocate or receive for investments on environmental protection.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a proxy for the economic size of each canton we use indicators related to the average business revenues, average annual energy consumption of households, proportion of businesses with a national or foreign client, tax revenue per capita, and proportion of the population who work in their own business.</p>
