  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> shows the calculated weights of each indicator, that is, their contribution to the formation of the composite vulnerability indicators. The largest weight corresponds to the institutional capacity. For the relative ordering we observe that the climatic indicators are among the ten with the largest contributions. Temperature has the second largest contribution, then wind velocity has the third, relative humidity the sixth; and, precipitation the tenth. Other indicators with large contributions are the proportion of households with sewage treatment service; the proportion of households with garbage collection service; the proportion of population working in agriculture, hunting or fisheries; the proportion of households owning agricultural land; and, the proportion of households receiving water through a pipe system.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, the indicators with the lowest contribution are funds for environmental protection per capita, population per non-medical doctor, population density, number of patients per hospital bed, and average energy consumption. Intermediate values appear for some of the sensitivity indicators such as the proportion of population with no social security coverage (11th), the proportion of households living below the poverty line (13th), the proportion of irrigated agricultural land with respect to total agricultural land (14th), the proportion of households with proper sanitary facilities (18th), and the proportion of households where the head is a female (20th).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> shows the vulnerability categories. The cantons with the highest vulnerabilities are located to the northwest of Ecuador, in the province of Esmeraldas, to the Midwest, in the provinces of Manabi and Los Rios, and to the South, in the provinces of Loja and Morona Santiago. In addition, most of the cantons in the Amazonian region are either in the highly or very highly vulnerable categories. The least and less vulnerable cantons are located to the central region of the country, mainly in the provinces of Pichincha; others are in the South, in the province of El Oro. The least vulnerable cantons are Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, and, Quito, Ecuador’s capital. These are followed by Cuenca, the third largest city in the country, and other mid-size cities such as Riobamba, Esmeraldas, Machala, Ambato, Loja, and Santo Domingo where populations range between 190,000 and 505,000 inhabitants. The correlation between the composite vulnerability indicator and population size is −0.5. This result points to the fact that larger cantons are not significantly less vulnerable.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other smaller cantons, such as Mejia (pop. 81,335) and Marcelino Maridueña (pop. 12,033), are also in the less vulnerable categories. Arguably the proximity of Mejia to Quito and of Marcelino Maridueña to Guayaquil implies that the development facilities and infrastructure of large cities spill over to the adaptive capacity of surrounding smaller cantons. This situation may also explain the low vulnerability of other cantons such as Samborondon and Duran with respect to Guayaquil; Pasaje and Santa Rosa with respect to Machala; and Rumiñahui with respect to Quito. The situation does not, however, apply to cantons such as Salitre and Nobol, which despite their close proximity to Guayaquil (on average 20 miles), appear as highly vulnerable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the category of moderately vulnerable cantons we find that Quevedo, Latacunga, and Babahoyo (where population size is at least 153,000 inhabitants) are not different, in terms of vulnerability, from other much smaller cantons such as Calvas (pop. 28,185), Macara (pop. 19,018), San Pedro de Huaca (pop. 7624), and Chaguarpamba (7161). This indicates that there is no clear pattern between population size and vulnerability to climate change. In the category of vulnerable cantons we find Portoviejo (pop. 280,029), which is one of the 10 most populated cantons in the country, as well as smaller cantons like Guaranda (pop. 25,001), Salinas (pop. 28,650), and Quilanga (pop. 4337).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the category of highly vulnerable cantons we have El Empalme (pop. 64,789), Santa Elena (pop. 30,920), Pallatanga (pop. 12,000) and Gualaquiza (pop. 7409). For the very highly vulnerable category we find mid-size cantons such as Lago Agrio (pop. 57,727), Pedro Carbo (pop. 31,337), Olmedo (pop. 4870), and Aguarico (pop. 1024), which is the canton with the highest vulnerability index.</p>
