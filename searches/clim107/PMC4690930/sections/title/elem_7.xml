 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2013, more than half of Marylanders (53%) said that they and their households are moderately or very vulnerable to the potential health effects of climate change (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t002" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t002">Table 2</a>). Only 17% of residents said that there would be no health impacts from climate change, or that they and members of their household were not vulnerable. There is substantial variation in climate health risk perceptions across the state, with mapping of the aggregate dependent climate health risk variable revealing specific regions of higher and lower risk perception than others, such as some coastal and urban areas (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-14994-f001" href="#ijerph-12-14994-f001">Figure 1</a>). Visual interpretation of the mapped results suggests that some of the higher areas of perceived risk are both more exposed to physical risks and have greater social vulnerability. The low-lying regions of the DelMarVa peninsula, the geographic region located between the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, are prone to flooding and at risk from projected inundation from sea-level rise, especially south of Cambridge [
  <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-14994">47</a>]. Urban heat islands cluster around the cities of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore [
  <a rid="B48-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-12-14994">48</a>]. Areas of the state with medium to high social vulnerability include almost all of Maryland’s Eastern Shore on the DelMarVa peninsula; Baltimore City and the surrounding county; Prince George’s County to the immediate east and north of Washington, D.C. (see Bowie on the map); the southernmost county on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, St. Mary’s; and the state’s panhandle north of West Virginia [
  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-14994">49</a>]. Further research is needed to empirically test these perceived spatial correlations.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.1. Regression Model Results Predicting Perceived Health Vulnerability</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As hypothesized, the covariates—general health risk perceptions and political ideology—account for a sizeable percentage of the variance in perceptions of vulnerability to climate health harms, 25% (adj. R
   <span class="sup">2</span>). Also as hypothesized, climate beliefs—certainty that climate change is occurring and an understanding of specific climate change health risks in Maryland—also greatly contribute to the explanatory capacity of the model, almost doubling it to 48%. The additional explanatory power of variables representing social vulnerability and hazard exposure is comparatively low, yielding an additional 3 percentage points in adjusted R
   <span class="sup">2</span>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our research questions posed whether social vulnerability and health susceptibility (RQ
   <sub>1</sub>), and risk exposure (RQ
   <sub>2</sub>), influence perceptions of climate change’s health threat. The results suggest these effects exist. Addressing our first research question, five of the seven factors for social vulnerability and health susceptibility are significant predictors of climate change health risk perceptions in a direction that would suggest that people who are more vulnerable feel themselves to be at higher risk, even holding constant general health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate change beliefs (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t003" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t003">Table 3</a>). Having one or more chronic medical conditions, being a member of a community of color (African American/black, Hispanic/Latino), and having less income are significant predictors of higher risk perceptions; being female is of near significance (
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.05). Higher education levels, while not associated with increased vulnerability to climate risks, also predict higher health risk perceptions. Being elderly is not a significant predictor.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results for exposure—the second research question—are split. In the final model, flooding is a significant predictor, while the proxy for urban heat is not. The social vulnerability and exposure variables were added to the regression in the final two regression models to demonstrate that they account for unique variance above and beyond general risk perceptions, climate beliefs, and political ideology. If the order of the regression models are reversed, with social vulnerability and exposure entered first, they explain 14% of the variance in the dependent variable as measured by adjusted R

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also find that some—but not all—of the factors for social vulnerability and health susceptibility influence whether or not people say they know their climate change health risks (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t004" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t004">Table 4</a>). Of the more than 2000 survey respondents, 183 said that they did not know whether they and their household were vulnerable to the health effects of climate change. Those who are at higher health risk from climate change—such as those with medical conditions, women, and people from communities of color—are more likely to say they know whether they are at risk. A number of characteristics not associated with greater risk—knowledge (level of education, and information about state climate health impacts) and income—also decrease the likelihood that someone will say they do not know whether they and their household are at risk from the health effects of climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The predictors in the logistic regression model all have odds ratios of less than 1, signifying that as each of these variables increases, individuals are less likely to report “don’t know” to personal and household climate change health vulnerability (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t004" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t004">Table 4</a>). As each measure increases by one, holding all other variables constant, the change in the odds that the respondent will say they do not know, 
   <span class="italic">versus</span> they say they know, is 0.55 for females, 0.81 for income, 0.69 for education, 0.62 for African Americans, 0.33 for Hispanics and Latinos, 0.72 for medical conditions, and 0.81 for Maryland climate health impact perceptions. Another way of saying this is that these groups are each less likely than their comparison groups to say that they do not know whether they are vulnerable. Women are 81% less likely than men; those with higher income levels are successively 23% less likely; those with higher education levels are successively 45% less likely; African Americans are 61% less likely compared to other races; Hispanics and Latinos are 199% less likely compared to those not of those ethnicities; those with higher levels of medical conditions and/or disabilities are successively 39% less likely; and those with higher perceptions of Maryland climate health impact are successively 24% less likely. The results should be interpreted with caution, however, as logistic regression has well-known problems in modeling rare events [
