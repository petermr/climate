 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary dependent variable—perceived personal and household health vulnerability to the effects of climate change—represents factor scores derived from three individual measures (α = 0.78) (
  <a ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t002" href="#ijerph-12-14994-t002">Table 2</a>). Respondents answering “don’t know” to their level of vulnerability on one or more of the three risk measures (19%) were dropped in the calculation of the measure due to the non-continuous nature of the data. The exploratory factor analysis extracted one component which explains 54% of the variance across the three variables. The communalities are 0.40, 0.69, and 0.53 respectively. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy is 0.68, above the recommended threshold of 0.6, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity, testing the equivalence of the variances, is statistically significant (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a second analysis, predictors of “don’t know” responses were evaluated using just one of the questions from the composite measure: “How vulnerable—if at all—are the people living in your immediate household, including yourself, to potential health impacts of climate change?”</p>
