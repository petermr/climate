 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three nationwide US surveys with diverse sampling and interview methods find 52% (in 2011) or 53% (in 2012 and 2014) agreement with the scientific consensus that human activities are now changing Earth’s climate (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g001">Fig 1A</a>). A series of 21 statewide New Hampshire surveys over 2010 to 2015 runs a few points higher than the national surveys overall (55%). On these surveys a substantial minority (31 to 39%) concede that climate change is happening, but caused mainly by natural forces. Few (3 to 8%) say they believe climate change is not happening, or decline to express an opinion. In social, cognitive or political terms, the now/human and now/natural respondents prove distinct, whereas now/natural and not now respondents are less distinct [

Survey questions that simply ask whether global warming/climate change is happening, without specifying a cause, confuse two opposing viewpoints—in effect, grouping some of the now/natural responses together with now/human.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CERA and CAFOR surveys target small and often rural clusters of counties, in regions selected for a variety of separate projects. Agreement with the scientific consensus ranges from 36 to 58% across these 11 surveys (

The regions studied include growing amenity-rich or near-urban areas, others dependent on coal or oil production, and still others with declining traditional resources such as forestry. Details of local environment and society help to understand place-to-place variations in climate and other environmental perceptions [
