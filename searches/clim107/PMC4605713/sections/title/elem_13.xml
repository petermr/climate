 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic responses to climate change can be conceptualized as lying along three axes: space, time, and ecology [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref042">42</a>]. The simplest metrics for assessing vulnerability to climate change consider only variation across space (e.g., diversity of elevation, aspect, or current climate)[
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref043">43</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref044">44</a>]. Climatic velocity additionally considers variation along a temporal axis. Biotic velocity adds consideration of a third ecological axis by incorporating information on the climatic niche breadth of individual species.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When seen in this framework, the velocity metrics considered here provide complementary sources of information for threat assessment and conservation planning under climate change. To provide informative results, the analog-based climatic velocity method must use a relatively narrow range of climatic conditions to define what constitutes a “match” between current and projected future climates. Climatic velocities therefore represent an upper bound of migration requirements because they effectively assume negligible climatic tolerances or adaptive capacities of populations inhabiting a site.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, biotic velocity is derived from climatic niche models which assume climatic tolerances based on a species’ realized niche. Biotic velocities provide a lower estimate of migration requirements which assumes local populations can adapt to any climatic conditions encountered within the full range of the species distribution. If a species’ fundamental niche is broader than the realized niche evident from current distribution data, or if adaptation allows a species to broaden its climatic niche over time, biotic velocity estimates will still be greater than the actual movement rate required for species persistence.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The large contrast between our mean estimates of climatic and biotic velocity demonstrates the contrast in magnitude that might be expected between estimates of the climatic tolerances of a species as a whole and estimates that assume a population is narrowly adapted to local climatic conditions. The magnitude of analog-based climatic velocity does depend in part on the parameter that defines how similar two climates must be to be considered as analogous (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s001">S1 Fig</a>). In principle, use of a climate bin width as broad as the climatic niche width of the average species could reduce climatic velocity values to a level similar to biotic velocity. In practice, results from such an analysis would be uninformative due to the presence of large regions with zero velocity (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s001">S1 Fig</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic velocity is often seen as a useful surrogate metric for assessment of climate exposure when species-specific information is lacking [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref001">1</a>]. For example, climatic velocity may be used to assess vulnerability of localized endemic species which have too few observations with which to successfully construct niche models. However, our results suggest that biotic and climatic velocity can serve complementary roles within a conservation planning process even when species-specific information is available. Consideration of climatic velocity can help address conservation of locally-adapted populations, a facet of the extinction crisis that is often ignored in conservation planning [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref045">45</a>]. Comparison of the geographic patterns of biotic and climatic velocity also helps planners distinguish regions where climatic velocity may be an adequate surrogate for climatic threats to biodiversity from regions where biogeographic factors play a greater role in influencing species vulnerability.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strengths and limitations of analog-based velocity vs. local velocity</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous reviews have emphasized the importance of considering fine-scale topography that may create microrefugia that allow species to persist in place, as well as the large-scale climate patterns that can push species off mountaintops or the poleward edges of continents [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref005">5</a>]. Because our method for calculating analog-based velocity is computationally efficient for even high-resolution climate surfaces, it can capture both fine and broad-scale factors within a single metric. However, analog-based velocity does carry some limitations compared to local velocity (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1</a>), and thus is best viewed as a complement to the latter metric, especially for vagile species which can disperse beyond the extent of a local neighborhood.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies have used local climatic velocity to estimate the movement vectors or paths that would allow organisms to track climatic conditions over broader continental scales [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref006">6</a>]. Such broader-scale context is important for identifying geographic barriers to connectivity under climate change. The nearest-neighbor search method used to develop analog-based climatic velocity does allow sources, destinations, and directional vectors to be identified [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. However, in the analog-based method, identification of the actual paths on the landscape that optimally connect sources and destinations requires additional analysis, for example using corridor delineation software [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref046">46</a>]. Such connectivity analyses may incorporate barriers due to human land use as well as information on climatic gradients [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic velocity values depend to some degree on user choices that include the number of climate variables considered, the spatial resolution of the data, and the parameter which defines what degree of similarity constitutes a climate analog [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref048">48</a>]. However, results have been found to be robust in terms of the spatial arrangements of velocity values and thus the relative threat levels assigned to different regions [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our hypothesis that future projected climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions was not supported. Our results instead suggest that areas of high future climatic velocity will not be confined to areas such as the boreal region which have experienced high climatic velocity in the past, but will extend into equatorial regions which have previously experienced low climatic velocity [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref014">14</a>]. Previous studies have proposed that the narrower thermal tolerances of tropical organisms make them most vulnerable to climate change despite a lower absolute magnitude of climate change in tropical regions [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref049">49</a>]. In our results, however, threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of exposure to climatic change (climatic velocity) and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these equatorial regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref050">50</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref052">52</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This result agrees with previous studies which found that tropical regions, and the Amazon basin in particular, were highly threatened by future climate change. Projected future change in monthly temperature, when expressed in standard deviations from historical values rather than as absolute temperature change, projects greatest change to occur in tropical regions [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref053">53</a>]. The Amazon basin has been ranked among the global regions with the highest distances to areas with projected future temperatures similar or cooler than current temperatures [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref054">54</a>], and also among the regions most dominated by future novel climates [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref023">23</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref055">55</a>]. Although the equatorial zone generally showed higher exposure than other latitudes, a wide range of velocities was also evident at finer scales within latitudinal zones (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g003">Fig 3</a> and 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s004">S4 Fig</a>), illustrating the importance of identifying and protecting refugia within otherwise vulnerable areas.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Plotting the hemisphere’s protected areas in terms of the four velocity metrics (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.g006" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g006">Fig 6</a>) reveals that most equatorial protected areas are highly vulnerable from the perspective of both forward and backward biotic velocities as well as forward climatic velocity. In contrast, polar protected areas showed a wide range of vulnerability to both climatic velocity and forward biotic velocity, and thus appropriate adaptation strategies will differ more widely in this region. Similar quadrant plots of forward and backward biotic and climatic velocity can be applied at a finer scale to inform regional or local planning efforts.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The species distributions used to develop biotic velocity estimates may be limited by historical biogeographic factors and limited dispersal ability, and thus underrepresent species’ potential climatic tolerances [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref056">56</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref057">57</a>]. However, this potential resilience is counterbalanced by the smaller population sizes and lower dispersal ability typical of narrow range species, which may place them at “double jeopardy” from climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref056">56</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previously, areas in Europe holding many restricted-range plant and butterfly species were found to hold climates that were more likely to be lost in the future [
   <a rid="pone.0140486.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref058">58</a>]. However, our results suggest a low correlation between areas of disappearing climates and species in the Americas. This contrast may be due to the contrasting historical biogeography of Europe and the Americas, or the contrasting taxonomic focus of the two studies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biotic velocity is similar to climatic velocity in that it synthesizes a large volume of data into a single metric that facilitates comprehension of common patterns across a range of variables. The contrasts in vulnerability between climate zones we observed appear robust in that they are not driven by a few highly vulnerable species (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s006">S6 Fig</a>). Nonetheless, there is substantial variation in the velocities experienced by different species within the large taxonomic groups we considered (
   <a rid="pone.0140486.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s006">S6 Fig</a>). Although aggregate metrics are a useful tool for discerning broad-scale threat patterns, conservation strategies will ultimately require consideration of individualistic species responses.
