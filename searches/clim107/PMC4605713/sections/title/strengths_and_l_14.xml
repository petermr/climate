 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous reviews have emphasized the importance of considering fine-scale topography that may create microrefugia that allow species to persist in place, as well as the large-scale climate patterns that can push species off mountaintops or the poleward edges of continents [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref005">5</a>]. Because our method for calculating analog-based velocity is computationally efficient for even high-resolution climate surfaces, it can capture both fine and broad-scale factors within a single metric. However, analog-based velocity does carry some limitations compared to local velocity (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g001">Fig 1</a>), and thus is best viewed as a complement to the latter metric, especially for vagile species which can disperse beyond the extent of a local neighborhood.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent studies have used local climatic velocity to estimate the movement vectors or paths that would allow organisms to track climatic conditions over broader continental scales [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref006">6</a>]. Such broader-scale context is important for identifying geographic barriers to connectivity under climate change. The nearest-neighbor search method used to develop analog-based climatic velocity does allow sources, destinations, and directional vectors to be identified [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>]. However, in the analog-based method, identification of the actual paths on the landscape that optimally connect sources and destinations requires additional analysis, for example using corridor delineation software [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref046">46</a>]. Such connectivity analyses may incorporate barriers due to human land use as well as information on climatic gradients [

  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref047">47</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climatic velocity values depend to some degree on user choices that include the number of climate variables considered, the spatial resolution of the data, and the parameter which defines what degree of similarity constitutes a climate analog [
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0140486.ref048">48</a>]. However, results have been found to be robust in terms of the spatial arrangements of velocity values and thus the relative threat levels assigned to different regions [
