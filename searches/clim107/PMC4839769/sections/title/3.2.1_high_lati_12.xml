 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For all simulations deforestation causes a reduction in global SAT, with the cooling being proportional to deforested percentage (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g004" href="#pone.0153357.g004">Fig 4</a>). The reduction in temperature is magnified at higher latitudes due to an increase in snow and ice cover and consequent increase in albedo. In the 100% scenario the average temperature change from 20°N to 40°N was -0.42K and the temperature change from 40°N and above was -0.78K. Lower atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> values are also responsible for some of the larger cooling seen in the 45% and 100% deforestation simulations (see Section 4). Deforestation also causes a decrease in global and local soil temperature (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g005" href="#pone.0153357.g005">Fig 5</a>—The term local refers to area weighted averages over the initially deforested grid cells), however soil temperatures become warmer in areas with large forest cover prior to deforestation (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g001" href="#pone.0153357.g001">Fig 1</a>). This warming is due to, similarly to what is observed more commonly in the mid- and low-latitude experiments, a decrease in sensible heat flux following deforestation. Soil temperatures show a similar trend to the SAT response

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the averaged global and local precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) point to drying, local drying is an order of magnitude larger than the global averages (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g006" href="#pone.0153357.g006">Fig 6</a>, top two panels). The areas with the largest drying occur in regions of increased soil temperatures. In these areas both ET and precipitation increase, however the increase in ET is larger than the increase in precipitation due to the enhanced soil temperatures. In the areas where conditions become wetter, there is also an increase of both precipitation and ET, however the increase in precipitation is larger. For all scenarios deforestation results in an overall drier climate over deforested areas (
