<p class="p">The low latitudes had the same initial soil carbon response to deforestation as the high and mid latitudes, with a small initial decrease over the first few years followed by a rapid increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g014" class="xref">Fig 14</xref>). As with the mid latitudes, the changes in soil carbon are explained by continuous increase in carbon density over non-deforested areas and a mixed response in the deforested bins. The largest soil carbon losses occur in the intermediary deforestation fractions, where soils are warmer and not as dry. Different from the high and mid latitudes, these losses resulted in periods where some intermediary fractions, like the 25% scenario, exhibited global changes soil carbon near zero. Again as seen in the high and mid latitudes, the experiments with the smaller soil carbon anomalies are the ones which show the largest concentrations of atmospheric CO

Similarly to the mid latitudes, the deforested bins of the 75% and 100% simulations hold the majority of the global soil carbon by the end of the experiments.
