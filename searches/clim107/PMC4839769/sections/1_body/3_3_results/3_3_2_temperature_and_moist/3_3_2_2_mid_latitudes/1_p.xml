<p class="p">Mean global SAT anomalies, while statistically significant by year 2100 (
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), are small and straddle zero K. At the end of the century the general tendency is cooling in the lower deforestation fraction with slight warming in the 15% and 25% scenarios. The larger input of CO

By mid-century albedo effects overcome the initial increase in greenhouse gas concentration and at the end of the simulation these scenarios exhibit very small SAT change or some cooling (
