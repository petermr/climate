<p class="p">The global SAT response to deforestation of 15% and higher is a general increase followed by cooling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>). The magnitude and rate of initial warming tends to be proportional to the deforested area fraction and higher deforestation fractions tend to reach their peak positive anomaly sooner. Similar to the mid-latitude experiments, albedo effects start to overcome the initial CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> driven warming but not to the point of generating negative anomalies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153357.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>). For the 5% scenario there is relatively constant warming associated with the progressive loss of forested area and addition of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the atmosphere seen in this experiment (see Carbon Cycle results below). SAT change over deforested bins is eventually dominated by the local increase in albedo and differs significantly from what is seen globally. At the end of the simulation all scenarions show negative local anomalies. As in the global case, the relative importance of albedo effects tend to be increase with deforested area (
