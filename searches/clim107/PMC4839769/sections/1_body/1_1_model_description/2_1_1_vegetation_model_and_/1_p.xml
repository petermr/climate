Using a carbon balance approach, TRIFFID determines the change in areal coverage, leaf area index and canopy height, as a result of net carbon fluxes calculated by the MOSES 2 land surface scheme. MOSES 2 recognizes the five PFTs used by TRIFFID, plus four non-vegetation types, bare soil, urban areas, land ice and inland water. Based on a photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model, plant respiration and photosynthesis are dependent upon climate and atmospheric CO

This is based on the Lotka-Volterra approach and a tree-shrub-grass dominance hierarchy. TRIFFID also allows agricultural areas to exist. These areas are defined as croplands and are treated as grass PFTs for determining their biogeochemical and biophysical behaviors.
