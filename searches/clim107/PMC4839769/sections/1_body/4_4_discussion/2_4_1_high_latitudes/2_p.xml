<p class="p">Earlier simulations of complete deforestation in areas above 45°N caused an increase in soil carbon over deforested areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0153357.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], but in these experiments the extra soil carbon was not enough to compensate for the loss of biomass and litter carbon, leading to an overall loss of land carbon and a ≤ 5 ppm increase in atmospheric CO
