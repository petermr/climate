<p class="p">The opposing effects of warming and drying trends determines the exchange of carbon between soil and atmosphere. The 15% and 25% scenarios experience the largest local warming, however do not experience the same level of drying as is seen in the 45%-100% scenarios. The 45%-100% scenarios also experience less warming then the 15% and 25% scenarios, leading to reduced respiration in the 45%-100% cases and larger drawdown of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This results in larger soil carbon quantities and less atmospheric CO
