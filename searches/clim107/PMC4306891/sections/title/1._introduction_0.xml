 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) fifth report, the Earth system is experiencing an unequivocal warming, and will likely become dangerously warmer during this century [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-00767">1</a>]. In addition to climate change’s impacts on the physical Earth system, climate change also substantially affects human health, especially where infectious diseases are involved [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-00767">2</a>,
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-00767">3</a>]. There are three essential components for most infectious diseases: an agent (or pathogen), a host (or vector) and a transmission environment [
  <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-00767">4</a>]. For most climate-sensitive infectious diseases, climate change may impact the whole process of a disease’s development [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-00767">5</a>,
  <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-00767">6</a>], including the survival, reproduction, or distribution of disease pathogens and their hosts, as well as the availability and means of such pathogens’ transmission environments. For example, temperature increases impact the spread of malaria; Leeson [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-00767">7</a>] and Patz 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-00767">8</a>] revealed the influence of increasing temperature on the pathogen, while Beck-Johnson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-00767">9</a>] described the relationship between temperature and the population dynamics of the host (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Anopheles</span> mosquitos). Considerable attention has been focused on the influence of climate change on infectious diseases [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-00767">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-00767">11</a>]. However, previous studies have mainly concentrated on identifying the impacts of climate change on some component of the development of infectious diseases. The sensitivity of infectious diseases to climate change remains unclear because of the complex interactions between climate variables and the three key components of infectious disease development. As a result, quantitative screening (from a systematic perspective) for the infectious diseases that are sensitive to climate change is still a challenge without adequate research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The wealth of literature dealing with disease’ sensitivities to the climate mainly involve correlation or regression analysis. For example, Pearson’s correlation coefficients can be used to describe the crude relationship between average weather variables and logarithm of diarrhea morbidity [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-00767">12</a>]. A further study measured the link between climate change and diarrhea-associated morbidity and predicted the dynamics of diarrhea-associated morbidity in subtropical Taiwan by applying a climate variation-guided Poisson regression model [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-00767">13</a>]. However, such correlation analysis can only identify the static relationship between climate variables and infectious disease related parameters (
  <span class="italic">i.e.,</span> morbidity). In addition, other time series methods, such as cross-correlation analysis, provide opportunities for recognizing time lags and the temporal correlation between incidence data and climate data. They also assume that diseases respond linearly to climate variables, while research has revealed that climate change can have nonlinear influences on biological systems [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-00767">14</a>,
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-00767">15</a>]. This indicates that the impacts on infectious diseases might be different under different climate regimes. Therefore, those methods that assume linear relationships would fail to detect nonlinear relationships. On the other hand, Woolf’s relative risk statistic (RR) [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-00767">16</a>], which has been applied to estimate the increased risk of contracting a disease before and after a certain condition (or trait) is present [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-00767">17</a>], has become a standard measure in biomedical research [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-00767">18</a>]. Later, many more statistical factors have been proposed, including haplotype relative risk (HRR) [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-00767">17</a>], which is used to calculate the risk of disease in the presence of particular antigens or phenotypes. Potential impact fraction (PIF) was also developed by the WHO, to estimate the disease burden caused by the change of a given risk factor based on relative risk measurement [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-00767" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-00767">19</a>]. With RR as reference, if the relationship between infectious disease-related parameters and climate variables varies at two different climate statuses (
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, historical climate and present climate), it is possible to reasonably state that an infectious disease as sensitive to climate change through a metric that is similar to the RR, and employed to compare the risk variation corresponding to a specified change in a risk factor’s level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accordingly, this study proposes a statistically meaningful and comprehensive method to identify which infectious diseases are sensitive to climate change. Such a method is of particular importance for evaluating strategies to mitigate climate change’s influence on human health. This is especially the case when governments are making decisions concerning reasonable health care investments in the context of climate change. The rest of this paper is organized into four sections. 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-12-00767" href="#sec2-ijerph-12-00767">Section 2</a> introduces the methodological development using the RR as a reference. 
  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-12-00767" href="#sec3-ijerph-12-00767">Section 3</a> presents a case study in Anhui Province, China, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed screening method.
