 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the past 4.5 billion years, our planet has passed through ice ages, warmer interglacial periods, such as the present Holocene epoch that began about 10,000 years ago (
  <a rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib99">Thompson, 2010</a>). The planet has also witnessed at least five big mass extinctions (
  <a rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib49">Jablonski, 2002</a>) and, throughout these years, it has shaped its surface, pretty much helped by the world's most dominant species: 
  <span class="italic">Homo sapiens</span>. Indeed, when our ancestors took the decision to move out from Africa (
  <a rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib96">Shriner et al., 2014</a>), humankind embarked on a journey of no return (
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Diamond, 1997</a>). In fact, many of the global changes we are witnessing in the present days may be partly attributed to anthropogenic factors.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since ancient times, humans have killed wild animals for obtaining food and decimated forests for many reasons, including for building villages (...towns, cities, metropolis and megalopolis), crop plantation, cattle grazing, and road construction (
  <a rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib24">Diamond, 1997</a>). And the impact is impressive. Amazingly, it is estimate that over 475 million wild animals (
  <a rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) are killed on Brazilian roads each year (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbee.ufla.br/portal/atropelometro/" id="intref0015" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cbee.ufla.br/portal/atropelometro/</span>). Furthermore, modern humans are also currently obtaining natural gas and oil by utilizing hydraulic fracturing (
  <a rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib27">Ellsworth, 2013</a>), burning fossil fuels as never before and even exploring petroleum in deep waters (
  <a rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib38">Fisher et al., 2014</a>). The impact of these human activities is unpredictable in the long term, but will certainly influence the course of our existence on Earth.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tropical deforestation, mainly for grazing cattle and cropland expansion (
  <a rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib67">Morton et al., 2006</a>, 
  <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">Armenteras et al., 2013</a>), creates a drier, hotter climate in the tropics. For instance, land surface acts as a strong global carbon sink and a recent study reported a long-term decreasing trend of the Amazon carbon sink (
  <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">Brienen et al., 2015</a>), underscoring the importance of preserving tropical forests, not only to protect our global biodiversity but also to mitigate eminent deleterious effects on Earth's climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human development may benefit our way of living today, but also affect our future. All these changes, including our changing behaviour in response to these changes, may affect all kinds of living creatures, including wild animals (potential hosts for deadly pathogens) and arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes, the most important groups of vectors of pathogens from a medico-veterinary perspective (
