 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tick questing activity, reproduction, and survival, depend on several factors that, in turn, have a direct impact on tick distribution and abundance (
  <a rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib33">Estrada-Peña et al., 2013</a>, 
  <a rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib56">Lauterbach et al., 2013</a>,

  <a rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib51">Jore et al., 2014</a>). These include vegetation coverage, host availability, moisture and temperature conditions, photoperiod, and human activities. A very good account on the ecological physiology of ticks may found elsewhere (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent, long-term studies have demonstrated changes in the distribution of the castor bean tick 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</span> in different parts of its range. For instance, data from a 30-year study conducted in Sweden indicated a clear expansion of the distribution range of this tick towards northern latitudes (
  <a rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib50">Jaenson et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, the range of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in Sweden increased by 9.9% during the observation period and most of expansion occurred in the north (north of 60°N) where the tick's coverage area doubled from 12.5% in the early 1990s to 26.8% in 2008. Another long-term study carried out from 1977 to 2011 in Russia reported an increase in the abundance of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in the eastern part of its range (
  <a rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib55">Korotkov et al., 2015</a>). These studies have shown that the northward spreading of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in Sweden and Russia appear to be associated to climate change, particularly to the occurrence of milder winters and extended growing seasons. Host population dynamics, in response to climate change or due to human activities, may also have played a role in this process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the occasion of the IECID meeting in Sitges, someone asked me about the threshold temperature for 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span>, considering that winter temperatures in Sweden and Russia may be very cold for any living creature (a Brazilian would be inclined to agree). I probably did not elaborate a proper answer for that question, because the relationship between tick development rates and temperature is nonlinear (
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Randolph, 2009</a>, 
  <a rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib29">Estrada-Peña et al., 2012</a>). Categorically, 
  <a rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib101">Tomkins et al. (2014)</a> stated “while the idea of fixed temperature thresholds applying across populations may be a convenient assumption from the point of view of predicting the distribution of ticks, it may lack realism”. For instance, it has been demonstrated that geographically separated populations of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> show clinal variation in the response of questing to temperature, suggesting that physiological thresholds are not fixed in this species (
  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">Gilbert et al., 2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the United Kingdom, the onset of larval activity coincides with a threshold of 10 °C (
  <a rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib88">Randolph et al., 2002</a>), whereas the threshold temperature for activity by questing nymphs and adults of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> has been estimated as a weekly mean daily maximum temperature of approximately 7 °C (
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Randolph, 2009</a>; and references cited therein). Interestingly, questing nymphs and adults of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> may be found during winter in southern Italy, the southernmost part of its distribution range, often in sympatry with the winter tick 
  <span class="italic">Haemaphysalis inermis</span> (
  <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>). Both species can be collected with mean daily temperature below 5 °C in southern Italy (
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">Dantas-Torres and Otranto, 2013a</a>, 
  <a rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib21">Dantas-Torres and Otranto, 2013b</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The limiting temperature for winter survival depends on a range of factors, including tick species, developmental stage, number of days of tick exposure to a given temperature, and snow cover. For instance, 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> can survive 24-h exposure to temperatures ranging from −14.4 °C to −18.9 °C, but exposure for 30 days to only −10 °C can be lethal for a high proportion of unfed nymphs and diapausing engorged larvae and nymphs (
  <a rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib54">Knülle and Dautel, 1997</a>). Northern temperate tick species (e.g., 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> and ornate cow tick 
  <span class="italic">Dermacentor reticulatus</span>) are well adapted to survive in sub-zero temperatures (
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">Medlock et al., 2013</a>), but the capacity to supercool to temperatures of ≤ −17 °C appears to be an inherent ability of many tick species, regardless geographic origin (
  <a rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib22">Dautel and Knülle, 1996</a>). Paradoxically, enhanced snow cover may promote overwintering tick survival by preventing repeated freeze–thaw cycles, which may be more detrimental (
  <a rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib64">Medlock et al., 2013</a>). On the Antarctic Peninsula, the seabird tick 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes uriae</span> is exposed to extreme environmental conditions during the off-host phase of its life cycle (
  <a rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib7">Benoit et al., 2007</a>). An interesting study has demonstrated that winter temperature affects the prevalence of 
  <span class="italic">I. uriae</span> in the Brünnich's guillemot 
  <span class="italic">Uria lomvia</span>; an increase of 1 °C in the average winter temperature at the nesting colony site was associated with a 5% increase in the number of infested birds in the subsequent breeding season (
  <a rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib23">Descamps, 2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change will likely increase the climatic niche of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in Europe, including in northern Eurasian regions (e.g., Sweden and Russia) that were previously unsuitable for this species (
  <a rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib82">Porretta et al., 2013</a>). However, the response of ticks to climate change will vary widely from region to region and according to tick species. A recent ecological niche model for 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in Europe under a changing climate scenario predicted a potential habitat expansion of 3.8% in all of Europe. Interestingly, this model indicated habitat expansion in some areas (e.g., Scandinavia, the Baltics, and Belarus) and habitat contraction in others (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees, interior Italy, and north-western Poland) (
  <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">Boeckmann and Joyner, 2014</a>). Projected temperature changes also increased the basic reproductive number (
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub>) of the blacklegged tick 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</span> in Canada and in the United States (
  <a rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib72">Ogden et al., 2014</a>). 
  <a rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib58">Levi et al. (2015)</a> recently reported that projected warming by the 2050s is expected to advance the timing of average nymph and larva activity by 8–11 and 10–14 days, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effect of climate change (particularly of increased temperatures) in tropical zones may be deleterious to some species, adversely affecting habitat suitability and forcing certain tick species to colonize new areas. In South Africa, for example, it has been predicted that increasing the temperature by 2 °C will decrease habitat suitability for four tick species (i.e., the African blue tick 
  <span class="italic">Rhipicephalus decoloratus</span>, the South African bont tick 
  <span class="italic">Amblyomma hebraeum</span>, the brown ear tick 
  <span class="italic">Rhipicephalus appendiculatus</span> and the small smooth bont-legged tick 
  <span class="italic">Hyalomma truncatum</span>) (
  <a rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib28">Estrada-Peña, 2003</a>). Another study suggested that the progressive increase in temperatures seems to be forcing the dispersion of tropical bont tick 
  <span class="italic">Amblyomma variegatum</span> towards areas outside of zones that have a prolonged dry period in Zimbabwe (
  <a rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib34">Estrada-Peña et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, high temperatures adversely affect tick questing activity, especially at dry conditions (
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Randolph, 2009</a>). In southern Italy, we observed a decline in the questing activity by nymphs and adults of 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> during summer (
  <a rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib20">Dantas-Torres and Otranto, 2013a</a>). Interestingly enough, questing activity by larvae was apparently not affected in the same area. We have also observed a seasonal variation in the effect of climate on the biology of brown dog tick (
  <span class="italic">Rhipicephalus sanguineus</span> sensu lato) in southern Italy (
  <a rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib19">Dantas-Torres et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, high temperatures may be deleterious under low humidity conditions, even for ticks that are physiologically adapted to drier environments, such as the brown dog tick (
  <a rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib107">Yoder et al., 2006</a>).
