 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific evidence for rapid climate change is compelling and most experts in the field have now reached a consensus: the Earth's climate is changing. Evidence for this includes increasing global temperature, sea level rise (
  <a rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>), warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, declining Arctic sea ice, glacial retreat, increasing extreme events, ocean acidification, and decreased snow cover (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is modifying the environment where we live and our way of living. For instance, global warming is booming the market for air conditioning, which is expected to grow in the coming decades. The explosive growth of the air conditioning market and the increased fossil fuel burning in response to increased temperatures may contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and, again, to global warming. Indeed, the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons are major contributors to ozone layer breakdown, resulted in their replacement by hydrochlorofluorocarbons and, more recently, by hydrofluorocarbons (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Dahl, 2013</a>). Hydrofluorocarbons are better coolants and have no impact on ozone depletion, but they are super-greenhouse gases with high potential to contribute to global warming (
  <a rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib16">Dahl, 2013</a>). Hence, the solution for the ozone layer breakdown is contributing to the greenhouse gas effect. It is like a dog chasing its tail.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change may impact human health and wellbeing in many ways, including by facilitating the spread of many infectious agents. For instance, the changing scenarios of major vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease) have been linked to several factors, including urbanization and deforestation, changing demographics in both developing and developed countries, economic crisis, increased global movement of people and animals, and climate change (
  <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">Colwell et al., 2011</a>). For quite some time, scientists have endeavoured to predict large-scale responses of infectious diseases to climate change (reviewed in 
  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">Altizer et al., 2013</a>), as many components of the transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases are inextricably tied to climate (

  <a rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib1">Altizer et al., 2013</a>). For instance, many blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks spend the bulk of their life cycle in the environment and their development, survival and population dynamics depend on many factors, including host availability, vegetation coverage, and climate (
  <a rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib83">Randolph, 2009</a>, 
  <a rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib17">Dantas-Torres, 2010</a>). Climate change may influence tick distribution and density, as well as the risk of tick-borne pathogen transmission to humans (reviewed in 
  <a rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib57">Léger et al., 2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate change debate is warming up in the scientific meetings and becoming a priority on the agenda of both scientists and policy decision makers. On the occasion of the Impact of Environmental Changes on Infectious Diseases (IECID) meeting, held in the 2015 in Sitges, Spain, I was challenged to give a 20-min keynote talk on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases. Because 20 min is not enough to deal with such a complex subject, the objective of this article is to logically extend my rationale presented on the occasion of the IECID meeting. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but an essay on climate change, biodiversity, ticks and tick-borne diseases.</p>
