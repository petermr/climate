 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite globally consistent examples of poleward range shifts exhibited by species in response to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref002">2</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref004">4</a>], recent studies have argued that focusing predominantly on unidirectional shifts may, in fact, underestimate the true impacts of climate change on species’ distributions due to the complexity of potential configurations of the variables that instigate the shifts [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref115">115</a>]. As climatic niches are not necessarily associated with a latitudinally-defined gradient, habitat situated nearby, or closer to the equator, may provide refuge for species seeking new climate niches. While likely having little effect on projections at the global scale, finer-scale analyses such as this must acknowledge this uncertainty surrounding projections [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref115" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref115">115</a>]. Likewise, while some pelagic species have exhibited much faster rates of poleward movement [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref116" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref116">116</a>], rates of range expansion are dependent on the contrast of local temperature gradients, with strong variations in ‘climate velocities,’ or the rates and directions that isotherms shift through space [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref117" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref117">117</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref118" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref118">118</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, another study used a multi-model ensemble, including the DBEM, to project poleward range shifts of 26 to 28 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> in the UK’s waters [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref084">84</a>], which are greater than the global median projected rates of 15.5 to 25.6 km decade
  <span class="sup">-1</span> obtained using the same ensemble [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref042">42</a>]. Furthermore, although demersal species were able to expand their ranges to deeper water if environmental conditions became more suitable within the model, pelagic species’ locations within the water column were not analysed in this study, but have been shown or projected to occur in response to climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref070" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref070">70</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref119" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref119">119</a>]. Since this study focused on species currently harvested by First Nations for economic and subsistence purposes, changes in the relative abundances and distributions of southern species that are likely to shift polewards into BC’s waters were not taken into account, and may offer new harvest opportunities for First Nations’ fisheries. However, the potential for these invasive species to replace the full range of ecosystem services and cultural significance derived from species traditionally harvested would require further scientific analysis and community-based research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rate at which different species can genetically and phenotypically evolve to accommodate environmental change is also an important area of uncertainty that has been explored through various studies [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref083" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref083">83</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref120" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref120">120</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref121" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref121">121</a>]. To date, scope for genetic adaptation to meet the observed rate of environmental change has only been studied for a few species through laboratory experiments [
  <a rid="pone.0145285.ref122" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0145285.ref122">122</a>]. If adaptation to climate change were possible for marine species, our projections may represent an over-estimation of declines in catch potential. However, given the observed widespread responses of species to ocean temperature changes through shifts in distribution and phenology, long-term adaptation of marine species to continued environmental change may be unlikely.
