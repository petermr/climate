 <div class="title">Projected change in relative catch potential by commercial fishery with known First Nation participation.</div>
 <p>Changes were calculated using 20-year average catch potential for 2050 relative to 2000 within British Columbia’s marine environment. Projections reflected the lower (blue; RCP 2.6) and upper (red; RCP 8.5) ranges of climate change. Values on the right reflect conservative cumulative estimates of impacts on First Nations’ commercial fisheries revenue (median values for 2001–2010 in CAD). Letters represent the type of commercial fishery: [a] seine, [b] hand, [c] trap, [d] trawl, [e] hook and line, [f] longline, [g] dive, [h] troll, [i] gill net, [j] roe herring, [k] spawn on kelp, and [l] bait (see
