 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All species of sea turtles exhibit an oviparous reproductive strategy that requires gravid females to return to their natal beaches to lay eggs. While eggs remain buried in the ground during the 45–65 day incubation period, they are exposed to an array of environmental variables that influence the development of eggs and hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref001">1</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref003">3</a>]. During this time, developing embryos are also impacted by alterations to the nest environment induced by the eggs themselves [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref004">4</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref005">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incubation temperatures affect sex ratios of hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref006">6</a>], duration of the incubation period [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref007">7</a>], and hatching and emergence success [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref008">8</a>]. There can also be long-term impacts from incubation temperatures because they impact the operational sex ratios of adults [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref009">9</a>] and population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref010">10</a>]. Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, with warmer nests producing female hatchlings and cooler nests producing males [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref012">12</a>]. The temperature of the nest is influenced by physical traits of the beach, such as sand albedo [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref013">13</a>] and vegetation cover [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref006">6</a>], but is mainly impacted by prevailing climatic conditions. High levels of precipitation can reduce nest temperature and increase production of male hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref014">14</a>]. Seasonal changes in air temperature can cause shifts in hatchling sex ratios over the course of the nesting season [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref003">3</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref015">15</a>] and may also drive long-term changes in incubation conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref016">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of incubation temperatures that produces both sexes is called the transitional range (TR) and typically only spans 1–4°C [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref017">17</a>]. In leatherback turtles (
  <span class="italic">Dermochelys coriacea</span>), the TR is 1°C or less [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref011">11</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref018">18</a>]. The small TRs found in sea turtles means that even small changes in temperature can have significant consequences for hatchling sex ratios.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature during incubation also influences hatching success. In olive ridley turtles (
  <span class="italic">Lepidochelys olivacea</span>), incubation temperatures greater than 35°C result in the death of developing embryos and failure to produce any hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref019">19</a>]. High temperatures can also be fatal to hatchlings during the pre-emergence period, causing hatchlings to die at the surface of the nest after hatching, which can also greatly decrease hatchling production [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref020">20</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Temperature also interacts with water content of the sand to influence hatchling morphology in turtles. Shorter incubation times experienced by warmer nests can result in less yolk being converted to tissue [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref021">21</a>], which results in the production of hatchlings that are smaller [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref022">22</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref023">23</a>] but have higher energy stores. Smaller turtle hatchlings are less adept at terrestrial motion [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref024">24</a>], crawl slower, and swim slower [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref023">23</a>], but may survive better in energy-poor environments [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref025">25</a>]. However, larger hatchlings are less available to gape-limited predators. Furthermore, their faster swimming ability likely enables them to more successfully navigate through the large aggregations of predators offshore from the nesting beach [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref025">25</a>]. Assuming hatchlings have access to adequate food resources upon entering the water, the decreased size and speed of hatchlings from warmer and drier nests likely results in lower survival rates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of environmental conditions on egg development means that sea turtle nests are subject to stochastic environmental events and climate change has the potential to dramatically alter incubation conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref026">26</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref029">29</a>]. Central America is predicted to be more impacted by climate change than any other region of the tropics [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref030">30</a>]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections showed that Central America will warm by 2–3°C over the next century [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref031">31</a>]. Combined with the expected decreases in precipitation, the region will become increasingly hotter and drier in the coming decades.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Eastern Pacific, Playa Grande, Costa Rica is one of the largest remaining leatherback nesting beaches. At this site, low levels of precipitation and high temperatures have been linked to decreased hatching success and emergence of hatchlings from the nest [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref032">32</a>]. Consequently, these climate driven variabilities significantly influence annual reproductive output. Years that have higher temperatures and lower levels of precipitation produce fewer hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref008">8</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref032">32</a>]. As Central America becomes warmer and drier throughout the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, increasing egg and hatchling mortality will threaten the survival of leatherback turtles in the Eastern Pacific [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref032">32</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref033">33</a>]. Even with removal of the largest human-induced sources of mortality, the impacts of climate change alone are severe enough to drive the population toward extinction [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref033">33</a>]. The threat to these turtles posed by impending climate change warrants an investigation into possible mitigation measures to avert its most damaging impacts.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nest irrigation and shading have been proposed as possible climate mitigation measures for sea turtle nests [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref034">34</a>]. In natural nests, shading produced by vegetation lowers incubation temperatures and results in the production of higher proportions of male hatchlings [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref006">6</a>]. Shading by planting trees lowers nest temperatures and produces hatchlings with higher locomotion performance than nests that are not shaded [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref035">35</a>]. For some populations, hatchling sex ratios could reach 100% female by 2070 [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref036">36</a>] and shading of leatherback nests has been shown to increase male production without compromising hatchling fitness or hatching success [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref037">37</a>]. Likewise, experimental watering under certain conditions can lower nest temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref038">38</a>] in the same manner that rainfall can lower incubation temperatures, resulting in the production of males [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref014">14</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref015">15</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we combined shading and watering strategies to see how they interacted and influenced temperature and water content of sand at nest depth. In particular, our aims were to (1) compare the effectiveness of shading and watering in lowering sand temperatures, (2) examine the impacts of different water amounts on sand temperature and water content, and (3) compare how sand at depths of olive ridley and leatherback turtle nests responded to experimental treatments. The overall aim of this study was to provide a foundation on which to formulate future climate mitigation techniques for sea turtle nests.</p>
