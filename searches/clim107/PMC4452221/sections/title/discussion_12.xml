 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All experimental treatments significantly lowered sand temperature when compared to controls, but shading was more effective than watering. Temperatures in plots that received the highest amount of water and no shade were not significantly different from plots that were shaded with no water. Applying large amounts of water was no more effective at reducing sand temperature than just shading plots. Within water treatments, the highest amounts of water did not result in the lowest sand temperatures, indicating a threshold at which additional water does not further decrease sand temperature. Temperatures in every water treatment rebounded to control levels within 10 days after watering stopped, indicating that watering regimens must be maintained to achieve sustained reductions in temperature.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reason for the lack of a long-term watering effect on sand temperature was that solar radiation drives the temperature of the beach. When we stopped watering, the sun heated the beach and dried out the surface layer of the sand. The effect of watering was similar to that of a storm, in which a large amount of rain falls on the beach and then the beach heats up again after the weather clears. We observed this on Playa Grande with Hurricane Michelle in 2001 [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref004">4</a>] and at Rancho Nuevo, Mexico in 1982 [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref003">3</a>]. Similarly, on beaches that have distinct rainy and dry seasons, nests heat up rapidly when the rainy season ends [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref007">7</a>]. When it stops raining, even if water content does not change, solar heating heats up the beach and the upper layers of the sand dry out. Evaporation decreases to near zero and the added water no longer cools the sand, but conducts heat downward, which is what we observed in this experiment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although water treatments were less effective than shading at lowering temperature, they maintained or increased water content of the sand, which is important for optimal incubation of sea turtle nests. The long-term impact of water content confirms previous results from in situ leatherback nests at Playa Grande. Playa Grande is in a dry area that receives no rain during 4–5 months of the nesting season and water received in the two months prior to nest deposition is one of the greatest factors influencing hatching success, even more important than ambient temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref032">32</a>]. Rainfall is a better predictor of hatching success of leatherback eggs at Playa Grande than air temperature because water content of the beach at nest depth is maintained through time, and temperatures at nest depth are not too high for egg development. Watering of nests at the beginning of the season may serve to offset the decrease in precipitation during this time of the year that is predicted in the region under future climate change scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref033">33</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Watering at the beginning of the season would also help to offset the negative impacts of changes in nesting phenology at Playa Grande, where the median nesting date shifted 0.3 days yr
  <span class="sup">-1</span> later between 1993 and 2013 [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref042">42</a>]. These changes in phenology are in contrast to studies postulating that increasing ocean temperatures could cause earlier nesting, exposing nests to more favorable conditions [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref043">43</a>]. 90% poaching of eggs between the mid-1970’s and early 1990’s resulted in a lost generation of nesting females [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref044">44</a>]. Beach protection began in the 1990’s and as these nests hatched and females reached reproductive maturity, the nesting population has shifted to a larger proportion of younger and inexperienced females, which tend to nest later in the season [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref042">42</a>]. As the nesting season progresses, temperature increases while precipitation decreases, exposing nests to less favorable incubation conditions, which results in lower hatching and emergence success [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref008">8</a>]. Later nesting in the season at Playa Grande will place nests in increasingly adverse conditions, likely exacerbating the impacts of climate change. Such shifts make the development of mitigation strategies at the beginning of the nesting season particularly pertinent for this population of leatherbacks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to increasing reproductive output, watering regimens can also influence hatchling morphology. In loggerhead turtles, eggs incubating in artificial nests with very low gravimetric water content in the sand produced smaller hatchlings, while sand with a gravimetric water content of 0.06 (similar to water content in average and high water treatments in this study) produced the largest hatchlings and also had the highest hatching success [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref045">45</a>]. The trend of wetter substrates producing larger hatchlings has been reported for many reptiles, including map turtles (
  <span class="italic">Graptemys ouachitensis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">G</span>. 
  <span class="italic">pseudogeographica</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref046">46</a>], snapping turtles (
  <span class="italic">Chelydra Serpentina</span>) [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref023">23</a>], and bull snakes (
  <span class="italic">Pituophis melanoleucus)</span> [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref047">47</a>]. These larger sizes may incur fitness benefits, as larger turtle hatchlings exhibit greater survivorship [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref048">48</a>], greater crawling speeds [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref049">49</a>], and better swimming capability. High water treatments in this study corresponded to high levels of rain that resulted in the highest hatching success and emergence of leatherback hatchlings at Playa Grande [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref008">8</a>]. Even if watering is less effective at reducing sand temperature, it is still beneficial because it keeps moisture in the sand. Moist sand results in higher hatching success and may produce hatchlings with higher fitness levels while greatly increasing hatchling production.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Watering regimens should be applied with caution, however, as excessive water can be harmful. At greater than 0.06 g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span> gravimetric water content, loggerhead hatchlings become smaller and hatching success decreases [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref045">45</a>]. Saturation of the sand with water or flooding of the nest could prevent gas exchange in the nest and reduce hatching success [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref050">50</a>]. However, gravimetric water contents of 0.05 to 0.08 g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span> correspond to matric water potentials of about -5 kPa and gravimetric water content down to 0.01 still has a matric water potential of about—10 kPa [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref050">50</a>] so it is not dry. The water potential difference between the egg (about -900 kPa) and the sand will cause water to enter the egg and it will gain mass, which is why a sea turtle egg usually becomes turgid soon after deposition by absorbing water from the sand [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref050">50</a>]. Rainfall will not flood a beach at sea turtle nest depth as long as the nest is above the water table, but will drain down through the sand due to gravity until it reaches equilibrium with the capillary forces between the sand grains. Water potential in the sand column will usually be between -10 and -25 kPa [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref051">51</a>]. Only when there is a dry layer at the surface in which all of the water has evaporated and kPa reaches as high as -100,000 kPa will the water potential cause the eggs to dry out.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That was the case when the sand dried out in our non-watered plots and we could not dig down to get a sand sample at the experimental depth. The deep dry front in these plots suggests that eggs incubating under similar conditions would have dried out significantly, likely resulting in lower hatching success. The mitigation strategies that tackle the problems of climate change most comprehensively will likely be those that combine shade to lower temperatures when they get too high for development and watering hatcheries or the beach before eggs are incubated to prevent the negative consequences associated with dry incubation conditions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have compared for the first time the relative impacts of mitigation strategies on different depths in the sand. This is an important consideration in mitigation strategies, as depth interacted significantly with both shade and water. Additionally, water content tended to be higher at 75cm, likely due to evaporation in the top layer of the sand. This trend is supported by analyses of water content on the beach at Playa Grande, which showed that gravimetric water content is significantly higher at 75cm than at 45 cm. Mitigation strategies should therefore be species-specific, as both shade and water treatments will impact the temperature and water content of clutches differently at different sand depths.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Techniques will also be dependent on the objectives of the mitigation strategy. The transitional temperature range for olive ridleys in Costa Rica is around 4°C [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref052">52</a>]. Shade treatment without water decreases the temperature 2°C in comparison to controls, but adding water with shade decreases temperature about 4°C in comparison to controls. This means that shading with water may be capable of turning the nest from 100% female to 100% male. In cases where skewed sex ratios present a serious conservation concern [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref043">43</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref053">53</a>], shifting sex ratios in some nests by combining shade and water may be a desirable outcome in future scenarios of climate change. However, if current sex ratios are not problematic, then shading can be done at times when temperatures do not alter sex ratios to facilitate hatchling survival from the nest and increase reproductive output.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Altering sand temperatures not only changes hatchling sex ratios but may also impact the operational sex ratios of adults [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref009">9</a>] and population dynamics [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref010">10</a>]. Reconstructing a long-term data set of incubation temperatures is essential for determining mitigation measures because short-term data sets may not encompass variation in hatchling sex ratios that can occur over multiple decades [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref015">15</a>]. Thus, while sex ratios may be female-biased over a few years, over longer time spans the operational sex ratio may ultimately approach 1:1. Furthermore, natural shifts in hatchling sex ratios towards more females as temperatures increase may be adaptive, as it increases fecundity [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref010">10</a>], although taken to extremes, female biased sex ratios can negatively impact populations. Understanding natural shifts and annual variation in hatchling sex ratios and how these impact population dynamics should be the preliminary steps in developing an appropriate mitigation strategy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to this information, local environmental conditions will also impact mitigation strategies. Turtles may be able to nest under vegetation on some beaches, reducing the need for shading. On Playa Grande, however, leatherbacks tend to nest on the open beach and there is no vegetation nearby that could offer shade to nests [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref054">54</a>]. Shading can have the opposite effect of what we observed if shaded structures prevent rain from reaching nests [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref038">38</a>]. Because our study was conducted during the dry season, there was no rainfall and this was therefore not an issue. Additionally, applying water to nests that has been allowed to reach ambient temperatures can result in higher sand temperatures [
  <a rid="pone.0129528.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0129528.ref038">38</a>]. This was not an outcome in our study because we used tap water. Designing appropriate irrigation techniques is important to ensure that mitigation strategies have the intended effects.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future studies should test these techniques on actual clutches to examine their impacts on hatching and emergence success, as well as hatchling morphology and sex ratios. While further research is required before the implementation of such techniques, these results provide a foundation for understanding how temperature and water content in sea turtle nests will respond to climate mitigation strategies.</p>
