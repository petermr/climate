 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depth, amount of water received, and shade significantly influenced temperature during the course of treatments (p &lt; 0.001 all cases). Shading had the largest impact (Ƞ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.566), followed by water treatment (Ƞ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.441) and depth (Ƞ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 0.138). There were significant interactions between depth and shade treatment (p &lt; 0.001) and between depth and water treatment (p &lt; 0.001), but not between shade and water treatment (p = 0.360). The Bonferroni post hoc test showed significant differences in temperature between the control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.001 in all cases), between low and average treatments (p &lt; 0.01) and between low and high treatments (p = 0.001), but not between average and high treatments (p &gt; 0.05).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When looking at depths separately, the Bonferroni post hoc test showed that there were significant differences in sand temperature at 45cm between control and all water treatments (p &lt; 0.001) and between low and high treatments (p &lt; 0.05), but not between low and average (p = 0.06) and average and high treatments (p = 1.00). During the month of watering, in exposed plots at 45cm, temperatures in the low water treatment were on average 1.8°C lower than the controls, while average and high treatments were 2.3°C and 2.4°C lower, respectively (

Temperatures in shaded plots with no water averaged 2.2°C lower than exposed plots with no water, while low water treatments were 3.5°C lower, and both average and high treatments were 4.0°C lower. Each of the shaded plots with water treatments were 1.7°C lower than those in exposed plots with the same water treatment (
