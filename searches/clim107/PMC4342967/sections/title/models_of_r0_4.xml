 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The recent application of next-generation matrix (NGM) models to tick-borne diseases has provided some useful guidance about which demographic and epidemiological parameters are most important for the basic reproductive rate of the infection,

  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub>, defined as the number of secondary cases caused by a single infected individual in a wholly susceptible population, is particularly useful when considering whether tick-borne diseases can successfully invade and spread. The NGM approach offers a straightforward means of evaluating the sensitivity or elasticity of 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> to changes in each of a matrix of transition probabilities representing paths through which hosts or ticks become infected. These models consistently indicate that survival from fed larva to feeding nymph is a critical for

  <a rid="RSTB20140051C91" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C91">91</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C95" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C95">95</a>]. This observation is relevant to the spread of tick-borne disease in a changing climate since all of the steps in this transition, from moulting to overwintering survival to survival while questing, are sensitive to climate conditions. Also, when the phenology of ticks and the duration of infectiousness are included in the NGM of Lyme disease in North America, the probability that a nymph finds a competent host is also strongly influential [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C95" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C95">95</a>]. We suggest that a focus on those parameters with high elasticities will prove most fruitful, especially when considering alternative assumptions and hypotheses in this framework. For instance, most NGM models de-emphasize the importance of tick and host densities (but see [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>]), but this is probably because they assume that tick–host encounters are essentially constant [

  <a rid="RSTB20140051C95" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C95">95</a>]. Different function forms of host encounter term in epidemic models strongly alter the predictions of these models [
