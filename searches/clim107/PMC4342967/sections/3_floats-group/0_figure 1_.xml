  <p class="p">Conceptual model linking climate change to tick-borne disease in humans. Each arrow linking boxes represents an opportunity to fill in knowledge gaps. For example, determining how climate change at global and regional scales influences the key abiotic variables for ticks at local scales is critical. A mechanistic understanding of how specific abiotic variables interactively determine demographic, developmental and behavioural processes in tick vectors and dynamics of tick-borne pathogens requires further development. How climate-driven dynamics of ticks and pathogens affect risk of human exposure, how non-climatic factors influence risk, and how risk is translated into disease incidence are crucial variables for further study.
