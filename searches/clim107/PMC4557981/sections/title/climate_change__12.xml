 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To simulate potential future changes in water dynamics of individual montane wetlands in the PNW, we used simulated climate from the ECHAM5 general circulation model (GCM) forced by the A1B emissions scenario, which approximates the average conditions simulated for the region by ten different GCMs forced by the same emissions scenario. Climate projections were downscaled with the Hybrid Delta (HD) method described in detail in Appendix A of Tohver et al. (2014) [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref042">42</a>]. Briefly, the HD method uses quantile mapping techniques to produce the transformed monthly observed climate data (water-years 1916–2006; a 91-year time series) in response to 30 years of monthly GCM projections for two future time periods: the 2040s (2030–2059) and the 2080s (2070–2099). The future monthly values are then used to rescale the daily values from the observed month to produce a future daily time series. As a result, the HD approach provides 91 years of observed variability ("1916–2006") for each future time period, and is directly comparable to the historical record on an event basis from 1916–2006. Note that for historical runs we extended the VIC runs from 1916–2006 to 1916–2012 in order to use field data obtained in 2012. However, for climate scenarios we used existing data developed by Hamlet et al. (2013) [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref017">17</a>] that have 91 years of observed variability, projected for future time periods. For landscape scale projections of the probability of drying for intermediate wetlands in Washington, we used an ensemble of ten climate change projections from 10 different GCMs forced by the A1B scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref017">17</a>]. We report the average of these results.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For California, we used the ECHAM5 A1B scenario based on the Distributed Delta (DD) downscaling approach that is described by Littell et al. (2011) [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref046">46</a>] and Salathé et al. (2013) [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref043">43</a>]. Although, ideally, we would have used data downscaled with the same approach for the California sites as we did for the Oregon and Washington sites, these data were the ones readily available from previous studies. Similar to the HD approach, the DD scenarios construct a 95-year time series for two future time periods, which have the same number of years as the observations used in the downscaling. Although there are some differences in details between this downscaling method and the HD approach described above (e.g. length of record, method by which the changes in climate are applied to the historical time series), for our use here these differences are not particularly important. Both methods incorporate the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation changes from GCMs, and changes in the central tendency of projected temperature and precipitation in each region are similar in each case.
