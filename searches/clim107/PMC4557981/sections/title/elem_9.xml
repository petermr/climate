The PNW model implementation, historical simulations, and climate change scenarios are described in detail by Elsner et al. (2010), Hamlet et al. (2013), and Tohver et al. (2014) [

For given input data including temperature, precipitation, wind, vapor pressure, net incoming longwave and shortwave radiation, and air pressure, the VIC hydrological model simulates daily water balance variables such as snowpack, evapotranspiration, runoff, baseflow and soil moisture in three soil layers comprising the first several meters of soil. Simulations at each VIC grid cell cover an extended historical time period (water-years (i.e. October 1 to September 30) 1916–2012 for the PNW and 1916–2010 for CA). We used these water balance variables to develop empirical regression models of wetland response as described below and to hindcast historical variability of water levels in wetlands over 97 (PNW) and 95 years (CA) (
