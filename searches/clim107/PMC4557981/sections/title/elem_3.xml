 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We define wetlands broadly as any area where shallow surface water collects. Wetlands exist on a hydrologic continuum and many different methods of wetland classification exist (e.g. Cowardin, hydrogeomorphic (HGM)). We use a simple hydrologic classification scheme based on hydroperiod and wetland sensitivity to climate variability to characterize four ecologically relevant types of wetlands–ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, and permanent (
  <a rid="pone.0136385.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0136385.t001">Table 1</a>). This approach is similar to other hydrologic classifications based on hydroperiod [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref033">33</a>] and volumetric water loss [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref034">34</a>] in that it relates inherently continuous hydrologic variation in water permanence and periodicity to more discrete ecological thresholds determined by species’ development and life history requirements (e.g. number of months or years that ponds must hold water for an insect, frog, or salamander to develop and metamorphose).

Wetland-obligate plants, birds, and mesopredators, may also rely on perennial wetlands.</td>

Primary poductivity depends in part on the amount of shallow littoral habitat. Wetland macrophytes are common.</td>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantitatively we define the four wetland types based on average minimum water levels. Generally shallow 
  <span class="bold">ephemeral wetlands</span> dry completely or drop, on average, below 3% of their maximum water levels. Ephemeral wetlands are functionally dry for most aquatic species in most years, but may have water for the entire summer in unusually wet periods. 
  <span class="bold">Intermediate wetlands</span> drop to between 3% and 33% of their maximum water levels on average and may dry completely in some years. 
  <span class="bold">Perennial wetlands</span> drop to a mean of 33% to 70% of their maximum water levels and only in extreme droughts do they dry completely. For 
  <span class="bold">permanent wetlands</span> (lakes and large ponds), the average minimum water levels generally remain greater than 70% of their maximum water levels and are never dry in the historical record. These four types represent general hydrologic classes of wetlands that can be related to more detailed hydrogeomorphic wetland-classification systems such as those used in U.S. Natural Heritage programs and for conservation decision making [
