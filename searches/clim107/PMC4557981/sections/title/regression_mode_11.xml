 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wetlands even in close proximity to each other can show very different hydrologic behavior reflecting different pond types and different environments surrounding each wetland. Thus we first considered each unique wetland, investigated the best predictor per wetland, and used the best predictor to construct a single regression model as discussed below. This approach allows us to observe which predictors tend to offer the best fit across wetlands and wetland types, enabling us to estimate the impacts of climate change at the landscape scale.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a first step, we used the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s R) to identify the strongest relationships between observed wetland water level at each site and a suite of daily water balance variables that were input to, or output from, the VIC models, including precipitation, evaporation, runoff, snow-water equivalent, and simulated soil moisture in the three different layers. Secondly, we constructed empirical models of wetland response by fitting regression equations to observed wetland water levels (volumes or depths) using the best-correlated water balance variable. We used the R (version 3.2.0) packages “stats” and “hydroGOF” to develop regression models and generate model statistics [

  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref045">45</a>]. Because montane wetlands are relatively undisturbed by human changes in land use, when making future projections we assumed that the fitted regression relationships between wetland response and the soil moisture of the best-correlated water balance variable will not change with time. We developed a regression model using only observed data during drawdown periods because we did not have enough observed data during the rapid refill seasons to develop robust regression models for these. Also, for this system, the ecological consequences of altered timing of wetland drawdown and drying are greater than shifting timing of wetland refill, so we focused on the drawdown cycle for this reason as well.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most Mount Rainier, Olympic, and North Cascades sites, we had only a single year of data from which to fit the regression models. However, when multiple-years of observations were available (e.g. for some sites in Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park and for all sites in Oregon and California), we investigated the uncertainty in the projections when fitting to a single year of data. For Oregon and California sites that showed similar gradual drawdown patterns for observed years, we fitted a separate regression model for each individual year of multiple years of observations, developed simulations for all years using each of these models, and then calculated the squared correlation coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) using all observations and the corresponding simulations for each model. We then used the single-year regression model showing the highest squared correlation coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for all the available data to simulate historical wetland response and the associated climate-change response. We used the regression models fitted to other years to estimate the uncertainty in the simulations due to uncertainty in the regression parameters for individual years. For the Willamette National Forest site, for example, the squared correlation coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for the three regression models using 2003, 2005 and 2006 data to train the regression models, was 0.49, 0.88 and 0.75, respectively. Therefore, we used the regression model fitted on the 2005 observed data to simulate the historical response and used the regression models for years 2003 and 2006 to estimate the uncertainty of the simulation due to uncertainty in the regression fit.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park sites with two years of observed data presented somewhat different drawdown patterns between years in response to different weather conditions. For example, one site in ONP showed gradual drawdown for year 2012 but, intermittent drawdown and frequent partial refill events for 2000. Thus, we developed a regression model using the earlier year’s data (e.g. 2000 data for Olympic National Park and 1992 for Mount Rainier), which had a greater number of observations and showed more dynamic changes in water levels. We then used the 2012 data from both regions to validate the regression models in the context of potentially different patterns of drawdown and refill across years. We used root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate how the regression model developed using the earlier year’s data performed to simulate the 2012 data.</p>
