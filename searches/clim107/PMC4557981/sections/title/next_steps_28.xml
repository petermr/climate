 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our approach demonstrates a promising first step in relating simulated macro-scale hydrologic variables to observed wetland hydrologic behavior, and projecting the impacts of climate variability and change on montane wetlands in Washington, Oregon, and California. Our relatively robust results across different wetland types, especially given the limited data on which to build regression models, contradict the assumption that wetland dynamics are by definition too complex to model. Challenges remain, however. Because our methods were applied mostly in wetlands with at most a few years of observed hydrologic data (often only a single year), extending these approaches to confirm the robustness of our approach over different ecoregions, additional wetland types, and across a longer time series are essential next steps. These models also need to be coupled to better on-the-ground or remote sensing-derived data on wetland occurrence and type so that the most useful predictions about historical and/or future wetland changes can be made (e.g. existing wetland maps for Mount Rainier National Park miss &gt;50% of the small, biologically productive wetlands that we discuss here) [

  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref062">62</a>], and these in turn provide important validation datasets for retrospective modeling studies. Pairing improved maps with VIC hydrologic projections across large spatial scales will make it possible for the first time to identify hotspots of climate risk to wetlands, how these may interact with other stressors [
  <a rid="pone.0136385.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0136385.ref028">28</a>]. Overall, however, the models presented here offer a first step in beginning to fill the gap in scientific resources for wetland conservation, vulnerability assessment, and climate adaptation planning at both local and regional scales.
