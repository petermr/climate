 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different gaseous Nr species show the different increase rates during 2000–2005 in China, with 11.4%, 44.0% and 8.3% for N
  <sub>2</sub>O, NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub>, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The emission sectors of Nr also show large variations. N
  <sub>2</sub>O is the only form of Nr that has unambiguous global implications through the strong warming effect on climate (E1). Total anthropogenic N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions in China for 2005 were estimated at 1.04–1.22 Tg N. The primary source of N
  <sub>2</sub>O is agriculture. N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils (including emissions from applied fertilizer, manure and crop residues) amounted to a total of 0.59–0.87 Tg N, it can be further categorized as either direct (0.40–0.59 Tg) or indirect (0.19–0.28 Tg) emissions. Direct emissions are caused by N applied to the soils, while indirect emissions are related to subsequent processes after Nr emissions and re-deposition, or after leaching and runoff. Animal manure, including emissions from manure management and grazing animals, contributed 0.17–0.18 Tg N to the atmosphere. The emission factors for direct and indirect N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture in China were 1.87% and 0.66%, a little higher than the global mean values of 1.48% and 0.42%, respectively
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. In addition, N
  <sub>2</sub>O from fuel combustion, industrial production, waste disposal and biomass burning delivered only 0.14–0.30 Tg N to the atmosphere. As a result, N
  <sub>2</sub>O exerts a strong warming effect at 345 ± 19 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> basis, then transforms to 311 ± 17 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). The close climate impacts on both timescales imply lasting effects on the climate system resulting from N
  <sub>2</sub>O due to its long atmospheric lifetime of around 120 years.

  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> contribute to climate change indirectly through altering the atmospheric constituents and corresponding climate forcers. NO
  <sub>x</sub> is a major byproduct of combustion. Fuel combustion in China resulted in a total of 4.04–6.08 Tg N of NO
  <sub>x</sub> emissions in 2005, mainly from the combustion sectors of power plants (1.15–2.08 Tg N), transportation (1.26–1.66 Tg N), industry (1.35–1.79 Tg N) and household use (0.27–0.54 Tg N). Agricultural soils contribute a minor part with only 0.17 Tg NO
  <sub>x</sub>-N, mainly through microbial activity from agricultural soils. In sum, 4.34–6.24 Tg N is released to the atmosphere in the form of NO
  <sub>x</sub>. In comparison, the total emissions of NH
  <sub>3</sub> were 7.69–12.3 Tg N in 2005, becoming the largest source of atmospheric Nr in China. Agricultural soils (including volatilization and applied fertilizer and manure) and animal and human manure management are the main contributors, at 2.30–5.20 and 4.37–6.02 Tg N, respectively; other sources are negligible for the country as a whole. As a result, the combined climate impact of NO
  <sub>x</sub> on ozone and CH
  <sub>4</sub> (i.e. ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub> effect, E2) in China is −350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a 20-y and 100-y basis, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). Our results show that the net cooling effect of NO
  <sub>x</sub> on ozone and CH
  <sub>4</sub> is notable only at a shorter time horizon, and gradually wears off with increasing time horizon. In addition, exposure to tropospheric ozone is known to inhibit photosynthesis, damage plants, and reduce plant primary productivity and land C sequestration capacity (E6)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. The reduction in C sequestration due to the ozone effect for China has been simulated by the terrestrial ecosystem model and estimated at 111 ± 100 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e under controlled simulations for different scenarios
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. Therefore, the negative effects on the climate system and crop yields due to the indirect radiative forcing of ozone in China cannot be ignored. Both NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> can enhance the formation of light-scattering aerosols (E3). Compared with the NO
  <sub>x</sub> effect on the ozone-CH
  <sub>4</sub> effect (−350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively), the direct aerosol effect of NO
  <sub>x</sub> is much less, with only −97 ± 39 and −0.006 ± 0.004 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
  <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively; while the corresponding NH
  <sub>3</sub> effects on aerosol are −59 ± 23 and −0.11 ± 0.13 Tg CO
  <sub>2</sub>e, respectively. As the time horizon is extended, the direct aerosol effects of NO
  <sub>x</sub> and NH
  <sub>3</sub> both become smaller, and can be effectively ignored on a GTP
  <sub>100</sub> basis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>).
