 <div class="title">N deposition into terrestrial ecosystems and net C exchange due to N deposition.</div>
 <p>(a), Spatial distribution of N deposition rate in China. (b), N deposition into cropland ecosystem. (c), N deposition into forest ecosystem. (d), N deposition into grass land ecosystem. (e), N deposition into wetland ecosystem. (f), Net C exchange (NCE) due to N deposition. The blue color represents C uptake; the red color represents C emission. The spatial maps of N deposition rate around China were developed from the spatial interpolation technique through the application of ARCGIS 10.</p>
