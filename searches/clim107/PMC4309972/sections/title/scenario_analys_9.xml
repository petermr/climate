 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the possible or expected changes of different driving forcers, we set up a new set of three scenarios to depict the future trend of climate change (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S8</a>). Short-term projections (to 2020) were developed using a “baseline” path of development, which considered abatement options consistent with China's situation and policy. For long-term projections (to 2050), we applied a “storyline” approach similar to that used in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>. The situation in 2005 was used as the reference and those in 2020 and 2050 as the target years. (i) SRES I–Business as Usual (BAU) scenario is based on the assumption that Nr emissions will maintain the annual increase rate of 2000–2005 with no change. (ii) SRES II–Improvement scenario, builds on the BAU scenario and assumes that the N use efficiency of cropland will increase with an aspirational target of 20% until 2020
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" href="#b57">57</a> and a further 20% until 2050, which approaches the level of developed countries
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. (iii) SRES III-Abatement scenario, is designed to cut 10% of NO
  <sub>x </sub>emissions in accordance with the reduction target of the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” in 2020, and assumed that the nationwide NO
  <sub>x</sub> removal rate reaches 80% in 2050. Because of the limited C storage of terrestrial ecosystems, the N-induced C sequestration potential is projected to decline 50% and be negligible with the increased N use in 2020 and 2050. The values in 2010, 2030 and 2040 are calculated on the basis of the logistic growth model. In addition, we compared our SRES scenarios with the published Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), with four scenarios based on different concentration levels (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, with the numbers referring to different radiative forcing levels) rather than emissions
