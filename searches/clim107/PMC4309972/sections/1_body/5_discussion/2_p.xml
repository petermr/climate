<p class="p">The strong GTP and long lifetime of N
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>O makes it the largest and most lasting contributor to global warming in China. Agriculture is responsible for about 80% of the climate warming effect of N
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>O. The high N fertilizer input and low N use efficiency in China's agricultural fields are responsible for the increasing N

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Our scenario analysis shows that a larger mitigation potential for climate change could be realized through improving N use efficiency to reduce agricultural N
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>O emissions. Many approaches can be taken to enhance N use efficiency, for example, systematic crop rotation, wise use of fertilizer, and expanded use of nitrification inhibitors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. Although the agricultural activities are the largest contributor, emission of N
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>O from chemical industries also shows a large increase potential; and the control options are the most-effective in this sector
