<p class="p">Overall, anthropogenic Nr in China's environmental system has an obvious warming effect on a long timescale. The reductions in agricultural N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and industrial NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> emissions have a comparatively great mitigation potential for climate change in the long term; while a certain mitigation pressure appears in N-induced C sequestration only if realizing the efficient forest development and improved field management. The mitigation pressure of climate warming of anthropogenic Nr is still under great pressure with time. In 2050, more aggressive targets and more powerful measures should be taken to maintain in a specific radiative forcing level.
