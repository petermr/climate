<p class="p">The inputs of Nr into the terrestrial ecosystem are in the forms of N deposition and N fertilization. N addition into ecosystems can alter the physiology of soil microbes and vegetation, and concomitantly alter the balance of biogenic fluxes of GHGs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). N deposition sums to 15.1 Tg N/yr across China, with 3.56, 5.28, 5.68 and 0.57 Tg N deposited into cropland, forest, grassland and wetland, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b–e</xref>). The estimated N deposition is closed to the published inventories of NO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub>-C emissions (0.11 to 0.21 Tg C), resulting in an NCE of 27 to 176 Tg in terrestrial ecosystems during 2000–2005 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S6</xref>). Most regions in China's terrestrial system function as a net C sink; only a minor area in western China is an N-induced C source (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3f</xref>). Our results further show that, during 2000–2005, forest land has the largest C sequestration potential, with 31.9 to 136 Tg C as a result of N deposition, followed by grassland (4.5 to 45 Tg N) and cropland (1.8 to 5.6 Tg N). For fertilized cropland, in addition to N deposition, applied N, including chemical and organic fertilizers, was evaluated at 35.7 Tg in 2005
