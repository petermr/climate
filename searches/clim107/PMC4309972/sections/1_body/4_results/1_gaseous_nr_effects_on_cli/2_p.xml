 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub>-N, mainly through microbial activity from agricultural soils. In sum, 4.34–6.24 Tg N is released to the atmosphere in the form of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub>. In comparison, the total emissions of NH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sub> were 7.69–12.3 Tg N in 2005, becoming the largest source of atmospheric Nr in China. Agricultural soils (including volatilization and applied fertilizer and manure) and animal and human manure management are the main contributors, at 2.30–5.20 and 4.37–6.02 Tg N, respectively; other sources are negligible for the country as a whole. As a result, the combined climate impact of NO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> (i.e. ozone-CH

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" class="xref">Table S7</xref>). Our results show that the net cooling effect of NO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">x</sub> on ozone and CH
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4</sub> is notable only at a shorter time horizon, and gradually wears off with increasing time horizon. In addition, exposure to tropospheric ozone is known to inhibit photosynthesis, damage plants, and reduce plant primary productivity and land C sequestration capacity (E6)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. The reduction in C sequestration due to the ozone effect for China has been simulated by the terrestrial ecosystem model and estimated at 111 ± 100 Tg CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e under controlled simulations for different scenarios
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Therefore, the negative effects on the climate system and crop yields due to the indirect radiative forcing of ozone in China cannot be ignored. Both NO

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>e, respectively. As the time horizon is extended, the direct aerosol effects of NO
