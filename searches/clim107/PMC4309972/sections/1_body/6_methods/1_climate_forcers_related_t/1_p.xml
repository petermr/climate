<p class="p">Nr can exert a series of effects on GHG fluxes and on climate systems during its cascade flow. We needed to distinguish these “direct” biogeochemical consequences (i.e., radiative forcing) of atmospheric Nr emission from the “indirect” bio-geophysical climate feedbacks of terrestrial N dynamics through terrestrial GHG fluxes
