<p class="p">In this context, a comprehensive assessment of Nr emissions and use on climate impacts in China is needed to fully understand the consequences of Chinese agricultural, industrial and urban development. To address this need, we seek to answer three questions: (i) What are the climate change impacts of Nr emissions in China, (ii) what are the relative contributions from agriculture and industry sources, and (iii) what are the future climate impacts of Chinese Nr based on different development scenarios? A key challenge is to establish a calculation database for the different climate forcers related to anthropogenic Nr in China. We review and reconcile the relative data and parameters from a variety of literatures related to the Nr emissions in China and their radiative forcing intensities and atmospheric lifetimes. Global temperature potential (GTP) is the common metric to quantify and intercomparing the relative effects of climate forcers over varying timescales. GTP evaluates not only the long-term climate effect caused by emissions of long-lived species like N
