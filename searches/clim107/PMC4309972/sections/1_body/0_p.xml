<p class="p">Anthropogenic interventions of the global biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle have substantially raised the levels of reactive N [Nr, in general, including organic N, ammonium (NH

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Such dramatic increases can aggravate the impacts on the balance of climate forces in many ways, either through changes to the atmospheric constituents, or through feedbacks within the terrestrial ecosystem

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sub> also increases the formation of aerosols. In addition, the deposited and applied N into the terrestrial ecosystem alters the carbon (C) exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes between land and air
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. There are many cooling and warming interactions between N and the climate; the dominant effect of N on climate change is likely to vary across regions
