 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change adaptation is a new and rapidly evolving arena in conservation and management. Adaptation is an adjustment to actual or expected climate change and its effects that moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">2014</a>). Numerous adaptation strategies, decision frameworks, and methods exist to facilitate climate change adaptation (West et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">2009</a>; NFWPCAP 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">2012</a>; Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2014</a>), and adaptation practitioners often refer to adaptation strategies in three broad categories: resistance, resilience, and transformation (Millar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2007</a>). Resistance strategies seek to prevent climate change impacts to high-value and irreplaceable resources, whereas transformation strategies guide resource responses towards desired new conditions. Borrowing from the ecological definition of resilience [the amount of disturbance a system can absorb without changing states (Holling 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">1973</a>; Gunderson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">2000</a>)], resilience strategies for climate change adaptation were initially described as supporting system recovery, and were “best exercised in projects that are short-term, have high amenity or commodity values, or under ecosystem conditions that are relatively insensitive to climate change effects” (Millar et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2007</a>).
