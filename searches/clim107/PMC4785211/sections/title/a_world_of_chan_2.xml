 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The human footprint is ubiquitous on the planet such that many argue that we are now in the Anthropocene epoch (Steffen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2007</a>). Atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> is at its highest concentration in 800,000 years, driving increasing temperatures, sea level, and ocean acidity across the globe (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2013</a>). Recent temperatures are already extreme relative to the long-term record—the past 30 years likely represent the warmest period in the northern hemisphere, on average, of the past 1400 years (IPCC 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2013</a>). Over 80 % of U.S. National Park System areas with significant natural resources (235 out of 289 parks) are already at the extreme warm edge of historical conditions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>; Monahan and Fisichelli 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2014</a>). Beyond these recent changes, future combinations of temperature and precipitation in many areas may have no current analogs on the planet, making it difficult to predict potential ecosystem responses (Williams et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">2007</a>). Climate and other global change stressors not only challenge land managers’ abilities to protect and foster natural areas but also demand that we re-think conservation concepts, goals, and objectives in a continuously changing world (Hobbs et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2010</a>).

    <p>Recent (past 10–30 years) mean temperature relative to the historical range of variability (1901–2012) in 289 U.S. national parks (park plus surrounding landscape—30-km buffer). Park temperature is considered extreme if one or more of seven temperature variables examined is &lt;5th percentile (‘Cold’) or &gt;95th percentile (‘Warm’) of the historical distribution (adapted from Monahan and Fisichelli
