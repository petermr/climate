<p class="p">The human footprint is ubiquitous on the planet such that many argue that we are now in the Anthropocene epoch (Steffen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2007</xref>). Atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is at its highest concentration in 800,000 years, driving increasing temperatures, sea level, and ocean acidity across the globe (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>). Recent temperatures are already extreme relative to the long-term record—the past 30 years likely represent the warmest period in the northern hemisphere, on average, of the past 1400 years (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>). Over 80 % of U.S. National Park System areas with significant natural resources (235 out of 289 parks) are already at the extreme warm edge of historical conditions (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2007</xref>). Climate and other global change stressors not only challenge land managers’ abilities to protect and foster natural areas but also demand that we re-think conservation concepts, goals, and objectives in a continuously changing world (Hobbs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2010</xref>).
