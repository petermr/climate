 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laysan Island and Midway Atoll’s Sand, Spit, and Eastern Islands are part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) in the north-central Pacific Ocean. Midway Atoll (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), a classic atoll with islands close (&lt;500 m) to the shallow (&lt;5 m) carbonate rim and a deep (&gt;10 m), central lagoon, is comprised of three islands: Sand, Spit, and Eastern Islands that have mean elevations of 3.2 m, 1.5 m, and 2.6 m, respectively. Laysan (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>), which is characterized by a deep (&gt;20 m) carbonate rim and an island at the center of the atoll, has mean elevation of 3.9 m. Situated in the North Pacific, these low-lying atolls are exposed to large waves. Based on 14 years of hourly hindcast data
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a> (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 122,640), the average of the top 5% conditions experienced during a given winter (those experienced more than 100 hours) have wave heights, wave periods, and wave directions of 8.5 m at 15 s from 307°, and wind speeds and wind directions of 16.9 m/s from 273°, respectively. The average of top 5% of waves and winds experienced during a given summer have 3.0 m waves at 10 s from 71° and 10.4 m/s winds from 77°.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Waves on most atoll reef crests and reef flats are water depth-limited, which suggests as water depth increases with sea-level rise, larger waves
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> will propagate onto or develop via wind forcing on the reef flat or in the lagoon (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). Wave heights along the islands’ shorelines will become larger with rising sea level. Because wavelength in shallow water is primarily a function of the ratio of wave period to water depth, wavelengths will also increase with sea-level rise (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). Mean wave-driven run-up adjacent to the low-lying atoll islands, which is a function of wave height, wavelength, and the slope of the beachface
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>, will similarly increase with sea-level rise. Although there is large heterogeneity in the resulting wave-driven run-up around the islands
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> due to spatial variations in waves around the islands (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>) and beachface slope, there is a general trend of higher wave-driven run-up on the sides of the islands closer to the reef crest. This is related to greater wave and resulting set-up that influences depth-limited wave heights on the reef flat because less wave energy is dissipated on the narrower reef flats.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Across all sea-level-rise scenarios, the extent of inundation predicted under the passive modeling approach covers less area than the flooding extent forecasted by the wave-driven water level approach, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a> for Spit Island. For Sand, Eastern, and Laysan Islands, less than 19% of the islands’ areas are forecast to be inundated with sea-level rise = 2.0 m (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). Spit Island, which is much lower lying, becomes fully inundated when sea-level rise = 2.0 m. When passive sea-level-rise is combined with wave-driven water levels, similar patterns of impact occur at sea-level rise scenarios less than 1.0 m (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a>). Projected flooding doubles from sea-level rise = 0.0 m to 0.5 m for all islands except Spit, where sea-level rise and wave-driven water levels cause the projected flooding to quadruple to more than 44% of the island’s area. The dynamic modeling approach that incorporates wave-driven effects projects Spit Island to have approximately the same area flooded at sea-level rise = 1.0 m (96.5%) as is projected to be inundated by the passive modeling when sea-level rise = 2.0 m (98.4%). On Sand, Eastern, and Laysan Island, when sea-level rise = 1.5 m and 2.0 m, the flooding patterns start to diverge considerably from passive inundation patterns, as water levels begin to exceed the existing coastal berm and extend considerable distances inland over low-lying areas. Eastern Island shows the greatest difference between the passive inundation and dynamic flood modeling when sea-level rise = 2.0 m, for the passive modeling suggests an inundation extent of 18%, whereas the dynamic modeling predicts flooding to impact to 90% of the island’s area.
