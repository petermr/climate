 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hindcast deep-water waves and winds were used to drive simulations of waves and water levels on the atolls using Deltares’ Delft3D hydrodynamic model. Delft3D simulates water levels via the Delft3D-FLOW module, which is coupled to the SWAN wave model

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. These models have been shown to accurately model the propagation and breaking of waves and the resulting water levels over Pacific coral reefs

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, and specifically Midway Atoll
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. On reefs, wave breaking occurs generally at two locations – at the reef crest and along the coastline. Because wave breaking causes gradients in water-levels, wave breaking results in elevating water levels on the reef flat, then again at the shoreline. The elevation in water over the reef flat due to wave breaking at the reef crest

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a> has been referred to positive sea-level anomalies
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, whereas the superelevation of water along the shoreline in the beach’s surf zone
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a> is referred to as set-up. The SWAN output, such as wave height, wave period, and wave-driven water levels (positive sea-level anomalies and set-up) are coupled with the Delft3D-FLOW, providing updated water levels over which to compute the updated wave fields.
