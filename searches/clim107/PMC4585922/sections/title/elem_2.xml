  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential impact of sea-level rise inundation and flooding from ocean waves on Laysan Island and Midway Atoll’s Sand, Spit, and Eastern Islands were investigated using numerical wave - and water-level models driven by hindcast data and projected values of sea-level rise
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>. There are no wave buoys with long records for the study area. Accordingly, hourly hindcast wind and wave data
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a> from 1981–2004 were used to constrain the primary wave sources (North Pacific, trade wind, South Pacific, and hurricane waves) for the area. These data were analyzed for top 5% storm conditions because they represent conditions exceeded 36 h per month, and are most likely to coincide with a high tide and thus characterize maximum water level conditions experienced in a given year. Forecasts of the wind and wave climate in the study area
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a> are not in firm agreement on potential change and therefore this study does not take into account any future change in forcing. Because of the large range of forcing conditions, the data presented here are constrained to the two end-members: North Pacific winter and summer conditions that encompass the sources described above; spring and fall conditions fall between these two end-members.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hindcast deep-water waves and winds were used to drive simulations of waves and water levels on the atolls using Deltares’ Delft3D hydrodynamic model. Delft3D simulates water levels via the Delft3D-FLOW module, which is coupled to the SWAN wave model
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. These models have been shown to accurately model the propagation and breaking of waves and the resulting water levels over Pacific coral reefs

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>, and specifically Midway Atoll
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. On reefs, wave breaking occurs generally at two locations – at the reef crest and along the coastline. Because wave breaking causes gradients in water-levels, wave breaking results in elevating water levels on the reef flat, then again at the shoreline. The elevation in water over the reef flat due to wave breaking at the reef crest
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a> has been referred to positive sea-level anomalies
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, whereas the superelevation of water along the shoreline in the beach’s surf zone
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a> is referred to as set-up. The SWAN output, such as wave height, wave period, and wave-driven water levels (positive sea-level anomalies and set-up) are coupled with the Delft3D-FLOW, providing updated water levels over which to compute the updated wave fields.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bathymetric and topographic data</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the standard model settings were used, based on the previous successful implementation at Midway Atoll
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>. Seamless nested topographic/bathymetric grids were created as boundary data for the models. Larger atoll grids covered a broad area surrounding the entire atoll to water depths of 3000 m and had coarser spatial resolutions and larger grid cell sizes (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>); finer grids encompassing the islands plus the surrounding waters had higher spatial resolutions and were embedded into the larger, coarser grids. Midway’s atoll grid had 180,851 cells at 50-m resolution, the Sand Island grid had 147,000 cells at 20-m resolution, and the Spit and Eastern Islands’ grid had 73,125 cells at 20-m resolution
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>. Laysan’s atoll grid had 175,851 cells at 100-m resolution and the Laysan Island grid had 85,914 cells at 20-m resolution
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>; all of these were referenced to mean higher water. The methodology and bathymetric grids presented here reflect the current state of the reefs without future reef accretion because no data exist for the study areas and published vertical reef flat accretion rates for reef flats exposed to open-ocean storm waves (1–4 mm/yr
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" href="#b10">10</a>) are very small compared with the rates of projected sea-level rise until 2100. The results from the larger, outer domains for the larger models that covered the entire atolls were used as boundary input into the finer-scale, smaller sized domains in models around the atoll islands. The models were run with open water-level boundaries defined by astronomic forcing; the water level was adjusted for the four sea-level rise scenarios by defining an A0 tide amplitude (+0.5 m, +1.0 m, +1.5 m, and +2.0 m) with 0° phase.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inundation and flood modeling</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SWAN output wave heights and wavelengths were used as input for wave run-up computations at each grid cell in the surf zones adjacent to the islands’ sandy shorelines. Unlike preliminary efforts
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> that utilized equations developed for sandy shorelines, an empirical methodology
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> that utilizes breaking wave parameters at the foot of the slope was used to provide more accurate measures of wave-driven run-up for reef-lined coasts. For each grid cell, wave-induced set-up, wave-driven run-up heights, and sea-level-rise values were combined into total water elevations and then projected on the islands’ slopes along shore-normal transects to outline areas flooded. In order to map inundation and flooding on the islands, the modeled sea-level rise and wave-driven water-level surface was projected orthogonally upslope from each coastal point until land elevations exceeded combined water heights, with the highest point reached on each transect representing the high water mark. The extent of inundation and flooding was delineated by connecting high water marks from adjacent transects.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a refinement to the above method, to model inundation and flooding, water was modeled to flow into depressions if they were adjacent to flooded transects, hydrologically connected, and at lower elevations than the flooded transects. Although the empirical methodology
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> produces run-up elevations, it does not estimate run-up volumes; therefore, the volume of run-up that is likely to flow into adjacent topographic depressions is unknown. Thus in depicting the extent of inundation for sea-level rise scenarios, the initial inundation patterns were mapped as wave-driven flooding propagates onshore, representing a transient state before run-up volumes flow laterally into adjacent depressions. Based on the long average duration of storms (&gt;6 hours) and high frequency of swash motions (order ~12–900 times/hour) relative to hydraulic conductivities of such material (&lt;0.0001 m/s), it was assumed that on the time-scale of wave-driven flooding events, infiltration is approximately non-existent and thus the maximum extent of flooding was delineated as if run-up volumes were unlimited and no infiltration occurred. This allowed seawater to fill the topographic lows during storm events. For both the passive and dynamic wave-modeling approaches, inundation and flooding extents were mapped for all five sea-level rise scenarios. The passive approach depicts the amount of inundation above mean higher water due to sea-level rise only, while the dynamic approach considers the additional effect of wave-driven set-up and run-up from the average of the top 5% storm conditions in the hindcast forcing data
