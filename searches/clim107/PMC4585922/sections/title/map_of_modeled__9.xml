 <p>(
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Present sea level. (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) Sea level +2.0 m above present. Most reef crests and reef flats are depth-limited for waves, in that wave heights are limited to a fraction of the water depth. Thus, as water depth increases with sea-level rise over the islands’ reef flats, it allows for more deep-water wave energy to propagate onto the reef flats and more
