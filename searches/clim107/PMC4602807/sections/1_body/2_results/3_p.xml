<p class="p">The relations between the MEMC retention and the TE or the DE are depicted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>. In a concept of probability, each survivor would be transferred to each refuge or hospital equally and randomly. However, the PR in different supposed values would meet different T
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CM</sub> and T

 <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MD/A81" class="ext-link" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://links.lww.com/MD/A81</span>, which illustrate the connection between TE and PR, and between DE and PR, respectively) by permutation and combination algorithm in the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. If a maximum T
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CM</sub> encounters a minimum T
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SM</sub> by a fixed PR, a maximum TE boundary (TEmax) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>: Panel A) can be obtained. On the contrary, when a minimum T
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CM</sub> encounters a maximum T
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">SM</sub>, a minimum TE (TEmin) is acquired. However, in a retrospective case study, the patient and the nonpatient flow of each hospital and each refuge, respectively, are kept in a determinate ratio (a fixed PR). In such situations, the maximum and minimum values of TE depend on the MEMC retention for the patients. Therefore, due to the MEMC retention (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>: Panel A), an apparent TEmax (app. TEmax) and an apparent TEmin (app. TEmin) calculations are executed to evaluate the effect of the sequential-conveyance method. The same mathematical logic is applied for DEmax, DEmin, app. DEmax, and app. DEmin calculations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>: Panel B). In the real case of Xiaolin, if 16 patients (
 <italic class="italic">PR</italic> ≅ 0.1185) were subjected to the MEMC retention, the app. TEmax = 63.22% and app. DEmax = 66.88% would be obtained. Alternatively, since the patients are not retented to an MEMC, the app. TEmin = 52.15% and app. DEmin = 56.02% are obtained. These values are also equal to TE and DE, respectively.
