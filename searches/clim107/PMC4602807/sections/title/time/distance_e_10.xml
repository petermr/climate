 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the efficiency of the EMS transportation between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, the difference of the required time and the difference of the distance of these 2 methods are estimated. The subtraction of the total EMS transportation time of the conventional (T
  <sub>CM</sub>) method from that of the sequential-conveyance method (T
  <sub>SM</sub>) divided by T
  <sub>CM</sub> equals to TE. The subtraction of the total transportation distance of the conventional (D
  <sub>CM</sub>) method from that of the sequential-conveyance method (D
  <sub>SM</sub>) divided by D
  <sub>CM</sub> equals to DE.
