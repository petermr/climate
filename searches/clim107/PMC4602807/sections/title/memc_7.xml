 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What is proposed as a MEMC is a surge refuge, which is hybridized with a disaster-medical-aid center. The MEMCs have many differences compared with the traditional disaster-medical-aid centers or the casualty-collection points.

  </span> To evacuate the area of an MCI, all the survivors, including the casualties, will be transferred to MEMCs, so that the required emergency medical treatment for injuries will be given. These MEMCs are the only intermediate facilities from the disaster area to the hospitals. Fully equipped trailers with medical personnel and necessities reach a specific location that must be safe and wide. Meanwhile, armamentaria and manpower are ready for patient care. Physicians in a MEMC can do further professional triage and assign transferrals of the second-line ambulances to the requested hospitals. This analysis mostly focuses on the aspects of the emergency transportation in MEMCs.
