 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this EMS transportation, ambulances are categorized into 2 different lines. The first-line ambulances (1st-L ABL) transfer patients between the disaster area and a MEMC reciprocately. The benefits of this class are the saving of time and shortening of working distances. The second-line ambulances (2nd-L ABL) transfer patients between a MEMC and the requested hospitals, an action that directly transports heavily injured patients to specific hospitals only under the guidance of the physicians. A comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method is depicted in Figure
