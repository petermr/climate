 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area included 14 provinces in the CMB. Weather data were obtained from 216 observational stations of the National Meteorological Networks of Central China Meteorological Agency
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. These stations were chosen because they followed a south-to-north transect from low and middle latitudes in SW China to high latitudes in NE China (

Spring maize was the dominant maize system in the NE (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces), and the SW (Yunan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Sichuan Provinces) while summer maize was the dominant system in the NCP (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Beijing and Tianjin Provinces). In Shanxi and Shannxi Provinces in the NCP, maize was mainly sown in spring.
