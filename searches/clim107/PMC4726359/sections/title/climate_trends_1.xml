 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the entire CMB, average temperatures during the maize growing season increased significantly from 1980–2009 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S1</a>); the average temperatures were 21.8 °C from 1980–1989 and 22.6 °C from 2000–2009 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S2</a>). The average temperature increase per decade since the 1980s has been 0.37 °C, with faster warming in temperate systems (0.42 °C per decade for the NE and 0.36 °C per decade for the North China Plain, NCP) than in the sub-tropical and tropical systems (0.29 °C per decade for the SW) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). This warming is substantially higher than the annual temperature increase at the global scale (0.13 °C increase per decade), and is also higher than the increase during the maize growing season in the USA from 1980–2010

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S3</a>). Precipitation during the maize growing season differed greatly among areas, ranging from less than 300 mm in some areas of the NCP to more than 1000 mm in some areas of the SW; precipitation did not change, however, in any area from the 1980s to the 2000s (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1e,f</a> and 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S4</a>). From 1980–2009 in the maize season, the precipitation in the NE, NCP and SW averaged 491, 413, and 786 mm, respectively.
