  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the entire CMB, average temperatures during the maize growing season increased significantly from 1980–2009 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S1</a>); the average temperatures were 21.8 °C from 1980–1989 and 22.6 °C from 2000–2009 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S2</a>). The average temperature increase per decade since the 1980s has been 0.37 °C, with faster warming in temperate systems (0.42 °C per decade for the NE and 0.36 °C per decade for the North China Plain, NCP) than in the sub-tropical and tropical systems (0.29 °C per decade for the SW) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>). This warming is substantially higher than the annual temperature increase at the global scale (0.13 °C increase per decade), and is also higher than the increase during the maize growing season in the USA from 1980–2010
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>. Significant decreases in solar radiation were observed mainly for the NCP (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1d</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S3</a>). Precipitation during the maize growing season differed greatly among areas, ranging from less than 300 mm in some areas of the NCP to more than 1000 mm in some areas of the SW; precipitation did not change, however, in any area from the 1980s to the 2000s (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1e,f</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S4</a>). From 1980–2009 in the maize season, the precipitation in the NE, NCP and SW averaged 491, 413, and 786 mm, respectively.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Simulating with the Hybrid-Maize model
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, maize yield of the 1980s variety for the entire CMB decreased by an average of 8% due to climate change from the 1980s to the 2000s for both irrigated maize (from 9.5–8.7 Mg ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) and rainfed maize (from 8.9–8.2 Mg ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) ((grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates - grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*2000s’ climates)/grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). This decrease was greater than the 3.8% decrease in global maize yield attributed to climate over the same period
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>. Simulated yields with varieties used in the 1980s decreased by 10–11% in the NCP but by only 5–8% in the cold-temperate maize systems in the NE. For tropical and sub-tropical maize in SW China, grain yield has decreased 4% since the 1980s. The only area without negative effects of climate change (1980s vs. 2000s) was Heilongjiang Province (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S5</a>), which is located in northernmost region of China where the baseline temperature in the 1980s was not above the optimum for maximum grain yield
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. For all regions, the scenarios analysis for irrigated maize showed the attribution of maximum and minimum temperature for yield decrease from the 1980s to the 2000s was similar (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). For NCP, the 4% yield decrease for irrigated maize from the 1980s to the 2000s was attributed to the decrease in solar radiation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how farmers changed their crop management in response to warming since the 1980s, we collected information on sowing date and varieties. Sowing date was similar in the 1980s (average DOY = 135) and the 2000s (average DOY = 133) (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S6</a>). Regarding varieties, those planted in the 2000s had significantly more total growth days (8 days more) than those planted in the 1980s. Of the additional growth days, seven occurred in the post-flowering reproductive stage. The total growing degree-days (GDD, ≥10 °C) were therefore 12% greater for varieties in the 2000s than for those used in the 1980s (1403 vs. 1575 GDD). The more recent varieties thus have more time for grain filling and use light, heat, and other resources more efficiently than the varieties used in the 1980s.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yield performance was compared for combinations of two kinds of varieties (those planted in the 1980s and the 2000s) with two climate periods (the 1980s and the 2000s) (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). For the entire CMB area, average grain yield increased by 11–16% (from 9.4–10.9 Mg ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for irrigated maize and from 8.9–9.9 Mg ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span> for rainfed maize) due to farmers switching to longer-maturing varieties from the 1980s to the 2000s ((grain yield of 2000s’ varieties*2000s’ climates - grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates)/grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates). Observed maize yield increased 34% for the CMB between the 1980s and the 2000s
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. This indicated that benefits from changing varieties represented 32–47% of the overall yield gains over this period. Similarly, 50–60% of maize yield increase was attributed to variety improvement (genetic improvement) in the USA
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. Among different regions, the highest yield increase was observed in the NE, where yield for the varieties used in the 2000s with the climate from the 2000s was 21% higher for irrigated maize (and 15% higher with rainfed maize) than with varieties used in the 1980s and with the climate from the 1980s. With the same comparisons of varieties and climate in SW China, the grain yield increased by 10% of for both water conditions. In the NCP, the grain yield increased as much as 16% for irrigated maize but by only 8% for rainfed maize. In most regions, the estimated effects of climate trends on new varieties were negative and with similar magnitude as effects on older varieties. This suggests that while the new varieties have helped offset climate-related losses, their yields would have been even higher without climate change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Growing sensitivity of maize production to water</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To determine whether the gap between irrigated and rainfed maize yields in the region is increasing, rainfed yield was expressed as a percentage of irrigated yield for all combinations of two kinds of varieties and two climate periods (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). For the entire CMB, yield was 5% lower for rainfed maize than for irrigated maize when varieties used in the 1980s were combined with climates from either the 1980s or the 2000s. For the entire CMB, yield was 10% lower when varieties used in the 2000s were combined with the climate from the 2000s. The increased difference in rainfed vs. irrigated maize mostly occurred in the NE and NCP, while water remained a non-limiting factor in SW China. The importance of climate in causing the drop in rainfed vs. irrigated yields was most apparent in the NE (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S7</a>), which is partly related to slight reductions in precipitation (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1f</a>) and to increased evaporative demand in a warmer climate
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To meet yield potential without irrigation, we found that the critical level of precipitation was 462 mm during the maize growing season for the modern, longer-maturing varieties in the CMB (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>). Among regions, the NE and NCP required similar levels of precipitation (446–460 mm) to fully achieve the yield potential whereas lower levels of precipitation did not affect yields in the SW (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S8</a>). Current precipitation in 40% of the entire CMB failed to meet the demand of the modern varieties. Precipitation in 62% of the NE and 60% of the NCP failed to meet the demand of modern varieties. For example, precipitation during the maize growing season in Hebei, Shannxi and Shanxi Provinces in the NCP was only about 350 mm, resulting in a 100-mm gap between maize water demand and supply. This gap substantially decreases the possibility that yield potential will be achieved without irrigation.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of water as a limiting factor is increasing because of the shift to longer-maturing varieties, and because of the adoption of other agronomic measures that have been used to increase yield. In the Midwest of the USA, for example, farmers have increased planting density, which obviously increases the demand for water
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" href="#b27">27</a>. Because the CMB encompasses regions with diverse climates, research from the CMB concerning the effects of changes in varieties and climates on maize yields is relevant to many other parts of the world. In many developing countries in southern Asia, Africa,the Middle East, and South America, precipitation in the maize growing season ranges from 300–500 mm, which is near or below the level required to obtain the maize yield potential
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>; maize yield in these areas is severely limited by water
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As water resources become increasingly scarce, especially under climate change, securing food supplies will depend on increases in water use efficiency
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. Water use efficiency in maize systems can be increased by optimizing irrigation (e.g., by deficit irrigation) and by increasing soil water retention via conservation agriculture, minimum tillage, and the covering of the soil surface in the field (with crop residues or plastic)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>. Water-use efficiency can also be increased by rotations that include crops that are especially efficient in their use of water
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>. Another important approach is to develop high-yielding, stress-tolerant maize varieties
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" href="#b1">1</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we found that the gap between rainfed yields and irrigated yields substantially increased from 5% in the 1980s to 10% in the 2000s and that 40% of the maize production area in CMB now fails to receive the precipitation required to achieve full yield potential. Growing sensitivity of maize production to water scarcity resulting from a shift to longer-maturing varieties makes adaptation to climate change especially difficult and suggests that new adaptation measures are needed. These measures include new approaches to agronomic management and water management and the breeding of new varieties.</p>
