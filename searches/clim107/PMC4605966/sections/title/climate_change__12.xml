 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nationwide total of the carbon storage effect, the material substitution effect, and the energy substitution effect attributable to HWPs derived from domestic forests (the annual change in carbon storage relates to HWPs derived from domestic forests, and the annual carbon emissions reduction attributable to material and energy substitution) is shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig10">10</a>. The mitigation effect under the Con &amp; BAU scenario was the smallest at 1.3 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2050. The mitigation effect under the Int &amp; Agg scenario was the largest at 8.4 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2050, equivalent to 2.4 % of the nationwide carbon dioxide emissions volume in 2013 [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]. Looking at the breakdown of three effects, under the same scenario, 15 % is seen as derived from carbon storage, 34 % from material substitution, and 51 % from energy substitution.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the decline of the forestry and wood industries in Japan is currently an issue [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>], it is imperative to promote the use of HWPs derived from domestic forests to contribute toward revitalizing these industries. Therefore, the aggressive usage scenarios have the potential to produce the combined effect of both revitalizing the domestic forestry and wood industries and achieving carbon emissions reduction related to HWPs. On the other hand, the volume of the usage of HWP derived from domestic forests has a trade-off relationship with the volume of carbon storage in domestic forests [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>]. According to the results estimated from a carbon balance model for Japanese forests (including both vegetation and soil) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>], carbon removals (annual changes in carbon storage) by domestic forests declined from around 20 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> under the BAU scenario to around 10 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> (approximately 50 % decrease) under the aggressive wood harvesting scenario in 2050. Our estimated results showed that the volume of the overall climate change mitigation effect of HWPs could be expected to be over 8 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in 2050 under these aggressive usage scenarios, and mostly compensate for the decrease in domestic forests. An important future consideration is an integrated investigation of the carbon balance for both HWPs and forests [
