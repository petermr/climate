  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows carbon storage volume attributable to HWPs derived from domestic forests by region. Under the BAU and BAU scenario, it is assumed that the future carbon storage volume for the whole of Japan declines compared to the actual value of 48 MtC in 2013 to the equivalent of 98 % of this level in 2030, and the equivalent of 96 %, or 46 MtC, in 2050. This decline is influenced by the downward trend in demand for wood, and is in line with declines in population and building construction up until 2013. However, under the scenarios whereby domestic roundwood production and HWP usage is promoted (the Mod &amp; Mod, the Plan &amp; Agg, and the Int &amp; Agg scenarios), we assume an increasing trend until 2050. In 2050, the highest carbon storage volume occurs under the Int &amp; Agg scenario, at a value of 125 MtC and equivalent to 262 % of the 2013 level. Focusing on regional distribution, although results vary according to the scenario and timescale, 16–20 % of the nationwide carbon storage volume is assumed to be in east Japan, 56–62 % in central Japan, and 21–24 % in west Japan, with the carbon storage volume high in central Japan, which includes the Tokyo metropolitan area. In addition, our breakdown of the carbon storage volume by application is as follows: building construction 68–88 %, civil engineering 0–12 %, furniture production 4–12 %, and paper making 7–13 %.

  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> shows annual changes in the nationwide carbon storage volume attributable to HWPs derived from domestic forests. Under the Con &amp; BAU and the BAU &amp; BAU scenarios, as a result of a decline in carbon storage volume, the annual change has a negative value up until 2050, and a carbon storage effect cannot be expected. However, under the Mod &amp; Mod, the Plan &amp; Agg, and the Int &amp; Agg scenarios, the annual change has a positive value until 2050, and a carbon storage effect can be anticipated. In particular, under the Int &amp; Agg scenario, 2.9 MtC year
  <span class="sup">−1</span> is estimated for 2030, the biggest effect among the scenarios, which is in line with the trend in the volume of domestic roundwood production (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). There is significant scope for growth in the HWP stock derived from domestic forests. However, because the volume of domestic roundwood production reduces thereafter, until 2050, the carbon storage effect decreases.
