 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quality-rating scheme is based on a two-stage set of objective criteria (see full method description and justification in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>). An initial assessment is made of the reliability of an age, based on the dating procedure used, followed by an evaluation of the confidence in the stratigraphic relationship (referred to as ‘association') of the dated material to the target megafaunal taxon or archaeological event.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ages obtained using five commonly used geochronology techniques in Sahul were rated for their quality
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>, with reliable ages coded as m* or m.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Radiocarbon dating</span>. Reliable ages can be obtained by applying ultrafiltration, ninhydrin or XAD-2 protocols to individual amino acids or well-preserved bone and dentin collagen, and strong oxidation reagents (acid chlorate or dichromate) to charcoal. Reliable ages can also be obtained from cellulose isolated from wood, seeds, macrofossils and gut contents, and from the carbonate fractions of shells and corals with insignificant recrystallization, as assessed by X-ray diffraction.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Amino acid racemization dating</span>. Reliable ages can be obtained from eggshells and otoliths of the target species, provided they have acted as chemically closed systems (i.e., no exchange in amino acids following burial of remains). Multiple analyses should be reproducible with low uncertainties and age calibration requires the availability of independent (and reliable) age estimates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Uranium-series dating</span>. Reliable ages can be obtained from materials that behave as chemically closed systems or as open systems when combined with modelling of uranium-migration processes. Reliable ages can be obtained from fossil teeth using coupled uranium-series/electron-spin resonance dating.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Electron-spin resonance dating</span>. Reliable ages for tooth enamel can be obtained when combined with uranium-series modelling or if the internal dose rate due to uranium in dentine and enamel is &lt;10% of the total dose rate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <span class="italic">Luminescence dating</span>. Reliable ages can be obtained using the optically stimulated luminescence signal from individual grains and multi-grain aliquots of quartz or feldspar if the sediments were well bleached by sunlight before deposition. Reliable single-grain ages can also be obtained for partially bleached sediments using appropriate models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second step of the quality-rating scheme attributes a final A*/A rating to each m*/m age ranked in the first step (that is, to ages that satisfy the high-quality criteria for sample pretreatment and dating), based on the strength of association of the dated material to the target species of megafauna or the archaeological remains. Direct dating of megafaunal fossils can give A* or A ages, provided they satisfy the above criteria, as association is assured. However, indirect ages require careful checking for the strength of association. Such ages can be reliable if samples are recovered from contexts with high stratigraphic integrity and where fossils or other dated materials show no evidence of reworking (for example, burial sediments containing the articulated skeleton of a target species).</p>
