 <italic class="italic">Megalibgwilia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Metasthenurus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Palorchestes</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">Thylacinus</italic>) estimated to have been driven extinct between 44 and 35 kyr. We provide similar statistical support for the first human arrival in Sahul at 55.6 kyr (CI
 <sub class="sub">human</sub>=55.4–55.7 kyr for the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively), which is similar to other recent estimates

 <sub class="sub">human</sub>−upper CI

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). Interpreting the youngest dated fossil records for each taxon as the actual time of extinction (ignoring the Signor–Lipps effect) would predict an older extinction peak at 50.8 kyr (CI
 <sub class="sub">megafauna</sub>=45.9–57.1 kyr, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>), whereas the oldest dated archaeological evidence for human arrival would be 55.5 kyr (CI
