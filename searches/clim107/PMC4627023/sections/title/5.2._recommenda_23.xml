 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extending previous studies based on the TPB, this study shows that BOC is a good complementary variable for the TPB and that the ECC model is superior to the TPB in explaining the variation in intention to purchase energy-efficient appliances. Thus, to increase households’ intention to purchase energy-efficient appliances and encourage citizens to purchase higher-priced, energy-efficient appliances, the government should help households understand that the energy cost savings of energy-efficient appliances exceed the price premiums of such appliances.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The amount of energy consumed is determined when appliances are brought to a house. One of the critical places within which the household sector can reduce GHG emissions is in the appliance market. This study recommends that the industrial sector provide the energy consumption information of all the appliances and make a comparison list for salespeople and retailers who introduce these appliances to consumers. Households can then compare the energy consumption and cost of the appliances immediately. For example, households could determine how many years it would take for the savings from reduced energy costs to exceed the price premium of an energy-efficient appliance. Such a strategy might increase households’ intention to purchase the most energy-efficient appliances.</p>
