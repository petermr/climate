  <span class="italic">per capita</span> CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions are approximately 11.1 t [
  <a rid="B50-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50-ijerph-12-13162">50</a>], which is close to the OECD average of 12.76 t [
  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-13162">51</a>] and far in excess of the global 
  <span class="italic">per capita</span> emissions of 3.96 t. Direct energy use by Taiwanese households accounted for approximately 27 million metric tons of carbon in 2000 and 32 million metric tons in 2010 [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-13162">45</a>]. Kaohsiung, the most important industrial metropolis in Taiwan, has an annual average 
  <span class="italic">per capita</span> CO
  <sub>2</sub> emission of 26.3 t [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-13162">52</a>]. Notably, the majority of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions in Kaohsiung originate in the industrial sector (68%), followed by the commercial and household sectors (23%). Therefore, the Taiwanese government encouraged households to purchase energy-saving appliances and classified the energy consumption of appliances into five levels. Level one represents the most energy-efficient appliances, which typically have the highest prices. This study aimed to develop the ECC model and applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to confirm the model’s applicability in the study’s sample of Kaohsiung residents.
