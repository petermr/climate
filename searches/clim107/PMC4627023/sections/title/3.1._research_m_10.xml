 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study was based on the TPB, and oriented from mitigating global warming to develop the model of efficiency action toward climate change (ECC) model. Notably, some studies on environmental behavior have measured intention behavior instead of actual behavior [

  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-13162">49</a>]. This study considered the appliances of households that remained in use and had not been recently replaced. Therefore, this study examines intentions regarding pro-environmental behaviors, not actual behaviors.

  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-13162">14</a>] clearly outlined the ways in which central model variables should be measured. In the ECC model, all the independent variables of the TPB (EA, SN, and PBC) are presumed to predict the dependent variable (intention toward efficiency actions, IEA). In addition, as an independent variable, BOC is also assumed to predict IEA.
