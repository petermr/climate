  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Attitude has been defined in a variety of ways, but at the core, it is the notion of evaluation. Thus, attitudes are commonly viewed as summary evaluations of objects along a dimension ranging from positive to negative [
   <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-13162">27</a>]. As a general rule, more favorable attitudes toward a behavior should produce stronger individual intentions to perform the behavior [
   <a rid="B28-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-ijerph-12-13162">28</a>]. Thus, general behavior should be more closely related to a general environmental attitude (EA) [
   <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-13162">17</a>]. Ha

   <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-13162">29</a>] indicated that the attitude toward an energy-efficient product has a stronger effect on intentions than the subjective norm component. To determine the predictors of purchasing energy-efficient appliances, both the specific EA under the circumstances of global warming and the attitude of the individual toward purchasing energy-efficient appliances were identified in the efficiency action toward climate change (ECC) model.

In line with most studies, SN was defined as pressure from the person who will remind the individual to purchase energy-efficient appliances in the ECC model.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of perceived behavioral control in TPB is the non-volitional elements, which can predict the behavioral intention. PBC comprises two separable components, self-efficacy and controllability, and can be considered a unitary latent variable in a hierarchical factor model [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-13162">36</a>]. In pro-environmental behavior studies, PBC and other TPB factors accounted for 95% of intentions with respect to conservation behaviors [
   <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-13162">37</a>]. PBC was also one of the psychological factors that influenced energy-saving behaviors [
   <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-13162">15</a>]. However, in a study on modes of travel, Tikir

   <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-13162">18</a>] demonstrated that PBC was not a significant predictor of behavioral intentions. In line with the studies of Abrahamse

   <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-13162">15</a>] and Lam [
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-13162">22</a>], PBC was defined as the convenience of buying energy-efficient appliances for an individual in the ECC model.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2.4. Perceived Benefit or Cost (BOC)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ajzen and Driver [
   <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-13162">38</a>] distinguished behavioral beliefs into two independent types: beliefs about the costs or benefits of engaging in a behavior (instrumental beliefs) and beliefs about positive or negative feelings derived from the behavior (affective beliefs). This study refined the construct of behavioral beliefs by defining instrumental beliefs as the perceived benefit or cost (BOC). Perceived benefits are defined as beliefs about improved conditions or gains produced by a given action, whereas perceived costs involve beliefs about losses engendered by that action.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with other behaviors, an individual’s BOC influences whether they engage in environmental behaviors; less benefit or more cost reduces the likelihood that individuals will engage in environmental behaviors [
   <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-13162">39</a>]. For example, consumers who were willing to pay a higher price for emulsion lacquer paints with an environmental label expected a personal advantage from using the labeled products [
   <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-13162">40</a>]. Similarly, mothers may have strong concerns about environmental and food safety and may thus be willing to pay more for eco-labeled apples [
   <a rid="B41-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-12-13162">41</a>]. In one study, approximately 49% of Australian tourist respondents were willing to pay extra for hotel accommodations powered by a micro-generation renewable energy supply [

   <a rid="B43-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-ijerph-12-13162">43</a>]. Altruistic and environmental attitudes, along with a greater ability to pay, have been shown to reliably predict willingness to pay a premium price for using green electricity [
   <a rid="B44-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-ijerph-12-13162">44</a>]. Gaspar 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-13162">45</a>] argued that their results indicated a preference for first considering cost, followed by quality and energy consumption.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study distinguishes between PBC and BOC and uses different variables to assess them. PBC is concerned with the perceived ability to perform a behavior (or a sequence of behaviors), and it is quite similar to Bandura’s work on self-efficacy [
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-13162">35</a>], whereas BOC indicates that more benefit or less cost would encourage individuals to engage in behaviors based on their behavioral intentions.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, although an incandescent light bulb and an LED light bulb emit the same luminous flux, an incandescent light bulb costs about US$1.57 in Taiwan, whereas an LED light bulb costs about US$4.72. The consumer has the perceived ability to buy both types of light bulbs. If the consumers do not have any more information, the cheap product is always purchased. However, including the BOC analysis in the same cases reveals that the annual electricity bill is approximately US$3.14 for an incandescent light bulb and US$1.50 for an LED light bulb. Thus, it is a good deal for the consumer to choose the LED light bulb over the incandescent light bulb if it will be used for more than 2 years.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ECC model followed the studies of Loureiro 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [

   <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-13162">46</a>] and identified BOC as follows: energy-efficient appliances were typically more expensive than traditional appliances, but the reductions in energy bills that were achieved by using energy-efficient appliances totaled more than the premium price.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pro-environmental behaviors have been grouped into two classes: efficiency behaviors and curtailment behaviors [
   <a rid="B47-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-ijerph-12-13162">47</a>]. Efficiency behaviors are one-time investments in efficient infrastructure such as a decision to use energy-efficient light. By contrast, curtailment behaviors are repetitive efforts aimed at reducing resource consumption, such as continually ensuring that lights are turned off in unoccupied rooms. Flemming 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B48-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-ijerph-12-13162">48</a>] emphasized that efficiency behaviors appear to be of greater benefit than curtailment behaviors, as they tend to result in a greater overall reduction in energy use. This study focuses on efficiency behaviors to determine the factors that influenced the households’ intentions to purchase energy-efficient appliances.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous studies have focused on intentions toward efficiency behaviors. For example, Lam [
   <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-13162">22</a>] used the TPB and modified models to predict people’s intention to save water and found that the TPB alone was insufficient to explain the intention to install a dual-flush controller in toilets, whereas an additional variable, the subjective effectiveness of alternative solutions, was a good predictor for such an intention.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Clark 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-13162">23</a>] argued that all the TPB variables were significantly positively correlated with water conservation intentions and that an additional variable, self-perceived knowledge of climate change, was also significantly related to such intentions. In addition, EAs and concerns regarding future shortages were significant but relatively weak determinants.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chen 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-13162">49</a>] proposed an integrated model that combined the TPB, the technology acceptance model (TAM), and habit to examine private vehicle users’ switching intentions with regard to public transit and found that the habitual behavior of private vehicle use hinders individuals’ intention to switch from a car or motorcycle to public transit.
