<p class="p">Greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be naturally released (e.g., through volcanic activity) or stored (e.g., in peat). Anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth [

Household energy use in the U.S. alone thus accounts for approximately 8% of total global emissions and surpasses the total emissions of any other country, except China. By contrast, in OECD countries, households are responsible for 20% of total CO

Despite these policymakers’ efforts, household energy consumption continues to increase, and more effective energy strategies seem to be warranted to reduce household GHG emissions [
