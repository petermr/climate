<p class="p">The population of Taiwan is approximately 23 million, and the

 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> emissions of 3.96 t. Direct energy use by Taiwanese households accounted for approximately 27 million metric tons of carbon in 2000 and 32 million metric tons in 2010 [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission of 26.3 t [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Notably, the majority of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in Kaohsiung originate in the industrial sector (68%), followed by the commercial and household sectors (23%). Therefore, the Taiwanese government encouraged households to purchase energy-saving appliances and classified the energy consumption of appliances into five levels. Level one represents the most energy-efficient appliances, which typically have the highest prices. This study aimed to develop the ECC model and applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to confirm the model’s applicability in the study’s sample of Kaohsiung residents.
