 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Raw data of percentage cover obtained from photo-transects were square root–transformed to down-weigh the influence of the most dominant taxa, and then a similarity matrix was constructed using the Bray-Curtis similarity distance. Three multivariate procedures were applied on the basis of the similarity matrix. In the first term and to visualize changes in species composition and assemblage structure across stations, depths, and time, an indirect ordination analysis, nMDS, was used. Then, for testing spatial differences and temporal changes in surveyed assemblages, an ANOSIM was used. This analysis provides a test statistic 
  <span class="italic">R</span> that varies between −1 and 1, the zero value representing the null hypothesis of no differences among a set of samples. Values between 0 and −1 are unlikely as they would indicate higher dissimilarity among replicates within a sample than with replicates from different samples. Generally, 
  <span class="italic">R</span> lies between zero and l, representing the magnitude by which samples differ (

   <span class="italic">42</span>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sediments and mass accumulation rates</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total SPM was measured gravimetrically after filtering 0.25 to 2 liters of seawater through combusted preweighed 25-mm Whatman GF/F filters. After filtration, filters were rinsed twice with distilled water to remove sea salt, then dried for 24 hours at 60°C, and weighed again. Filters were then burned at 500°C for 4 hours to obtain the ash-free dry mass to estimate the content of organic matter. Samples were taken monthly since 1992 at two stations in Potter Cove [see details by Schloss (
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
    <span class="italic">34</span>
   </a>)].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb analyses were carried out for five samples obtained from a 34-cm-long sediment core (PC/P03), which was obtained in the inner Potter Cove (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Activities of radionuclides (
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb, 
   <span class="sup">214</span>Pb, and 
   <span class="sup">214</span>Bi) were measured by γ-spectrometry (Ge-detector, GWC 2522-7500 SL, Canberra Industries Inc.) and processed with Genie 2000 3.0 (Canberra Industries Inc.). Counting statistics showed a lack of precision lower than 5% for the samples except those with very low 
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity (&lt;0.08 Bq g
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). The accuracy of this method was tested by using a standard reference material similar in matrix composition to the sediment samples (UREM-11) and was better than 10% for all radioisotope concentrations. To take account of changing sedimentation rates with time, the age of each sediment slice and mass accumulation rates of bulk sediments (MAR
   <sub>BS</sub>) were determined according to the constant flux model of Sanchez-Cabeza and Ruiz-Fernández (
   <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
    <span class="italic">47</span>
   </a>), which is based on the constant rate of supply model of Appleby and Oldfield (
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
    <span class="italic">48</span>
   </a>). 
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb excess data were calculated by the difference of the total 
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity and the supported 
   <span class="sup">210</span>Pb flux, which is given by the average of 
   <span class="sup">214</span>Pb and 
   <span class="sup">214</span>Bi activities. Activities of radionuclides of lacking sediment samples were interpolated at 1-cm steps.
