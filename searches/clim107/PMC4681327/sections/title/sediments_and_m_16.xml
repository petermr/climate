 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total SPM was measured gravimetrically after filtering 0.25 to 2 liters of seawater through combusted preweighed 25-mm Whatman GF/F filters. After filtration, filters were rinsed twice with distilled water to remove sea salt, then dried for 24 hours at 60°C, and weighed again. Filters were then burned at 500°C for 4 hours to obtain the ash-free dry mass to estimate the content of organic matter. Samples were taken monthly since 1992 at two stations in Potter Cove [see details by Schloss (

  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb analyses were carried out for five samples obtained from a 34-cm-long sediment core (PC/P03), which was obtained in the inner Potter Cove (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Activities of radionuclides (
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb, 
  <span class="sup">214</span>Pb, and 
  <span class="sup">214</span>Bi) were measured by γ-spectrometry (Ge-detector, GWC 2522-7500 SL, Canberra Industries Inc.) and processed with Genie 2000 3.0 (Canberra Industries Inc.). Counting statistics showed a lack of precision lower than 5% for the samples except those with very low 
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity (&lt;0.08 Bq g
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The accuracy of this method was tested by using a standard reference material similar in matrix composition to the sediment samples (UREM-11) and was better than 10% for all radioisotope concentrations. To take account of changing sedimentation rates with time, the age of each sediment slice and mass accumulation rates of bulk sediments (MAR
  <sub>BS</sub>) were determined according to the constant flux model of Sanchez-Cabeza and Ruiz-Fernández (
  <a rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" href="#R47">
   <span class="italic">47</span>
  </a>), which is based on the constant rate of supply model of Appleby and Oldfield (
  <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">
   <span class="italic">48</span>
  </a>). 
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb excess data were calculated by the difference of the total 
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb activity and the supported 
  <span class="sup">210</span>Pb flux, which is given by the average of 
  <span class="sup">214</span>Pb and 
  <span class="sup">214</span>Bi activities. Activities of radionuclides of lacking sediment samples were interpolated at 1-cm steps.
