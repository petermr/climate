 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contribution from the four different source areas: North America (NA), Europe (EU), Asia (AS), and the background (BG) is also shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f002" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f002">Figure 2</a>. For both Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> and RGM, the contribution from the global background is 64% of the total concentration in the 1990s, while Asia contributes with 25%, Europe with 6% and 5% arrives from North America. The difference in the contributions for the two decades is less than 1% for Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> and RGM, which means that the relative contribution from the source areas does not depend on the climate according to these model simulations. For particulate Hg, the contribution from the background is smaller (47% for the 1990s, 43% for the 2090s), mainly because of the transport of primary particulate Hg. Europe contributes with 17% in the 1990s and 20% in the 2090s, Asia with 30% and 31% for the two decades and North America with 6% for both decades. This indicates that the transport of primary particulate Hg, especially from Europe, is enhanced in the 2090s compared to the 1990s under the applied climate change scenario. Results from the DEHM model also indicates that the atmospheric transport of POPs to the Arctic is larger in a future warmer climate [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contribution to the deposition is also shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f003" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f003">Figure 3</a> and these are quite similar to the relative contributions of Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> concentrations as described above, reflecting that Hg is mainly transported to the Arctic as Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> which is oxidized to RGM and particulate Hg during the transport and some of this oxidized Hg is deposited. The larger atmospheric transport of TPM in the 2090s than in the 1990s is so small compared to the Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> that it does not influence the overall relative contribution distribution. The global background is the most important contributor. There are only very small differences (&lt;0.2%) in the relative contributions for the two decades indicating that climate change do not have a large influence on the relative contribution of the source areas. All the source areas in the Northern Hemisphere contributes to a large background pool of Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> and this is getting well mixed before the Hg is deposited because of the long lifetime of Hg
  <span class="sup">0</span> in the atmosphere (1 year). However, there are some differences between the source areas in how large a fraction of the total emission that is deposited in the Arctic (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f005" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f005">Figure 5</a>). Europe is relatively the most important source area from which around 4.4% of the total Hg emission is deposited in the Arctic in the 1990s, while it is 3.3% for Asia and 3.2% for North America. This shows that the emissions from Europe are more efficiently transported to the Arctic compared to emissions from Asia and North America, which are both located more southerly and in addition have a longer transport pathway before they arrive in the Arctic. Common for all three source areas is that these fractions are lower in the 2090s compared to the 1990s (3.7%, 2.7% and 2.6% for EU, AS, and NA, respectively), corresponding to 16%–18% lower. This is due to the lower deposition owing to the lower sea-ice fraction in the 2090s than in the 1990s.

  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-11254">9</a>] investigated the major source areas for Hg deposition to the Canadian Arctic using the Global/Regional Atmospheric Heavy Metals Model (GRAHM). Although their division of source areas was finer than the one applied in this study and their model domain did not cover the most eastern part of the Arctic, some similarities are seen. The contribution from re-emission and natural sources (corresponding to the background in this study) accounts for an estimated two thirds of the deposition to the Canadian Arctic, while (East) Asia is the major anthropogenic source area followed by Europe and North America.
