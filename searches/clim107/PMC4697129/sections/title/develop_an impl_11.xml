 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Develop an implementation strategy for operationalizing the H-NAP and integrating climate change adaptation into health-related planning and processes at all levels, including enhancing the capacity for conducting future H-NAPs</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This step calls for identifying approaches to ensure that the health risks of climate variability and change are considered in health planning at the local and the national scale.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Differences between an implementation strategy for the health risks of climate change and an implementation strategy for other health risks include a strong focus on integrating health systems policies and programs at local to national scales, where needed; consideration of much longer time frames for implementation; embedding implementation into an explicit iterative and adaptive management framework; and coordinating and collaborating across sectors.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The longer time frame for implementation includes considering a range of risks that are projected to change with changing weather patterns. For example, if projections suggest that vector-borne diseases could change their geographic range, then planning is required to determine where and when surveillance should be expanded. Another example is evaluating whether critical health care infrastructure could be at risk from rising sea levels or increasing storm surges in the coming decades and developing a strategy for moving or replacing those at high risk.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The effectiveness of health systems strategies and policies are likely to change as the climate continues to change and as development choices affect vulnerability and the ability to cope with the health risks of climate variability and change. Therefore, strategies and policies should be designed and implemented within an adaptive management framework.
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">12</a>, 
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">13</a> This includes regularly evaluating whether policies and programs continue to be effective or whether adjustments are needed. Adaptive management also calls for explicit exploration of different approaches to achieve objectives (eg, reducing vulnerability to particular health outcomes), testing alternatives to determine which are more effective, and then using the lessons learned to update knowledge and make modifications to policies and programs. This exploration is helpful when choosing which programs to scale out to wider geographic regions.
