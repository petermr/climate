 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation has been a critical component of the international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from the beginning. When signing the convention, all countries agreed to produce regular national communications covering their emissions inventory, current impacts and projected risks of climate change, adaptation options to prepare for and reduce those risks, and mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a green economy. The least developed countries (LDCs) also developed National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) to identify their urgent and immediate adaptation needs. Building on the experience gained through the NAPA process, including implementation of adaptation options to address urgent national needs, National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) are under development by LDCs and other developing countries to identify and address medium and long-term adaptation needs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NAP process was initiated at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010, at which countries acknowledged that national adaptation planning is an important process by which developing countries can assess their vulnerabilities, risks, and adaptation options.

   <span class="sup">1</span>
  </a> Further, the COP acknowledged that because the development challenges for LDCs are magnified by climate change, adaptation planning should move from primarily focusing on current climate variability and recent climate change to focusing more broadly on increasing resilience within the context of sustainable development planning. The COP established the NAP process to facilitate effective and efficient adaptation planning in developing countries. The UNFCCC Least Developed Country Expert Group (LEG) was mandated to develop technical guidelines to support the NAP process.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The agreed objectives of the NAP process are to (1) reduce vulnerability to current effects and future climate change-related risks, and (2) facilitate the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into development planning and other strategies within all relevant sectors and at local to national scales of governance. The COP also agreed that enhanced action on adaptation should do the following:
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div id="u0010" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Follow a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory, and fully transparent approach, taking into consideration vulnerable groups, communities, and ecosystems.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="u0015" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Be based on and guided by the best available science and, as appropriate, traditional and indigenous knowledge, and employ gender-sensitive approaches with a view to integrating adaptation into relevant social, economic, and environmental policies and actions, where appropriate.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="u0020" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Not be prescriptive, nor result in the duplication of efforts undertaken in a country, but rather facilitate country-owned, country-driven action.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using the LEG technical guidelines for conducting a NAP, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed 
  <span class="italic">Guidance to Protect Health From Climate Change Through Health Adaptation Planning</span>, taking into consideration the physical, social, and biological determinants of health.
  <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">
   <span class="sup">2</span>
  </a> The goal of conducting an H-NAP is to strengthen health systems to protect health from climate variability and change; this includes addressing upstream drivers of health risks. The determinants of a climate-sensitive health outcome interact with development patterns and other factors to create baseline vulnerability to climate change. Future vulnerability will be partially determined by the effectiveness of policies and programs to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the consequences of changing weather patterns. That is, the success of development policies in a particular location will depend to some degree on climate change, and the magnitude and pattern of climate variability and change will depend on development policies.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The WHO guidance aims to ensure that the health and environment sector follows a systematic process to do the following:
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div id="u0025" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Engage in the overall NAP process at the national level.</p>

   </div>
   <div id="u0035" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Develop a national plan with prioritized activities to achieve these goals, within a specific period and given available resources.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The health component of a NAP (H-NAP) follows the principles stated in the NAP guidance:
  <div list-type="simple" class="list">
   <div id="u0040" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>

   <div id="u0045" class="list-item">
    <span class="label">•</span>
    <p>Ensure that health adaptation planning is based on the best available evidence. Any adaptation plan should aim to strengthen the development and availability of evidence, build the data and reduce knowledge gaps, and inform relevant policies.</p>
   </div>
   <div id="u0050" class="list-item">
