 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the A2 scenario of climate change (see Methods), in 2080 only 9% of the extant localities would remain at temperatures within the current range of their respective species; this percentage was raised to 26% under the B2 scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>,d; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). This translates into a maximum of either 26 or 48 species predicted to have at least one population with suitable temperatures for the A2 and B2 scenarios respectively, and only 8 or 16 species with more than 50% of their current populations predicted to have suitable temperatures in 2080.
