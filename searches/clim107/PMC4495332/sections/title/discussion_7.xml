 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To our knowledge, this is the first study to collectively understand concerns and actions to mitigate climate change among a random sample of all registered dietitians in the United States. This study yielded several important findings: (1) the majority of registered dietitians surveyed agreed that climate change is an important issue, but are largely unsure that registered dietitians should play a major role in climate change mitigation strategies; (2) the region of the country that one resides is the demographic variable that was an important predictor of the belief that climate change is an important issue; (3) being vegetarian or vegan was significantly associated with actions promoting diet as a climate change mitigation strategy; (4) the belief that animal products are not essential in the diet was significantly associated with actions promoting diet as a climate change mitigation strategy; (5) comfort in promoting solely plant-based diets was significantly associated with actions that promote diet as a climate change strategy; and (6) the gap between concern for climate change and practice behaviors suggests a lack of knowledge or self-efficacy in connecting practice behaviors to climate change mitigation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an era where scientists forecast the current and future dimensions of climate change as worrisome, it is reassuring that 75% of registered dietitians agree or strongly agree that climate change is an important issue. This is consistent with the majority of Americans who believe in the reality of global warming (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>). However, only 46% of registered dietitians strongly agreed or agreed that climate change is an important practice issue and 50% are unsure if registered dietitians should play a major role in climate change mitigation strategies. This is similar to the findings of Sulda et al. in their survey of South Australian dietitians and nutritionists who ranked concern for climate change at a mean of 8.5 out of 10 with 10 being extremely important – but then ranked it lower in importance to a dietitian’s professional work in overweight and obesity, food security, diabetes, etc. (
  <a rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43">43</a>). Dietary recommendations to ameliorate nutrition-related chronic diseases can offer simultaneous co-benefits to the natural environment, such as reduced greenhouse emissions, eliminating the notion of competing interests (
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25">25</a>, 
  <a rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38">38</a>, 
  <a rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39">39</a>). Thus, offering dietitians educational opportunities and experiences that increase knowledge, skills, and abilities with regard to diet-related climate change mitigation as well as the resultant co-benefits could prove to be highly beneficial.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 38% of survey participants engage in activities that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy. This corresponds with the 34% that strongly agreed or agreed that registered dietitians should play a major role in climate change mitigation strategies and the 45% that strongly agree or agree that climate change is an important practice-based issue. While not the majority, it is still impressive considering that only 8% reported that their respective workplace provided funding for diet and climate change mitigation activities. Nevertheless, the substantial gap between the 75% that strongly agree or agree that climate change is an important issue and the 38% that promote diet as a climate change mitigation strategy should be noted. It may be that dietitians lack the necessary education, experiences, or skills to take action (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>, 
  <a rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45">45</a>). Or, like the general population, it may be that climate change is seen as a distant threat (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">42</a>). Wilson and Garcia found that clinical dietitians in Canada do not routinely discuss the impact of food choices on the natural environmental with patients (
  <a rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46">46</a>). In recent years though, some dietetic internship programs in the United States have incorporated “Sustainable Food Systems” as an emphasis in their accredited training program (
  <a rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44">44</a>), while some nutrition degrees from the associates level (
  <a rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47">47</a>) through the graduate level (
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>) and also offer such programs that even span across departments (
  <a rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48">48</a>). It will be important to learn the effect of these training programs on future dietetics-related practice behaviors and the associated environmental outcomes. Additionally, exposing students to risk-taking and diplomacy may prove fruitful (
  <a rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49">49</a>). Similar to other studies of allied health and public health providers (
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">34</a>–
  <a rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37">37</a>), our results demonstrate that there is a need within and across health disciplines for skill in incorporating climate change mitigation into practice.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Region of the country in which a registered dietitian resided was an important predictor in strongly agreeing or agreeing that climate change is an important issue. Dietitians residing in the South were significantly less likely to strongly agree or agree that climate change is an important issue. Certainly, norms, beliefs, and attitudes may exist and persist depending on the state and region in which one resides. Moreover, media coverage of diet-related climate change issues varies in certain geographic regions, and has been under-represented altogether in the media in previous years – particularly in the South (
  <a rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" href="#B50">50</a>). Because of the urgent nature of climate change, further investigation of what norms enhance or detract from the importance of climate change mitigation in practice is warranted – including those that occur from within the profession itself. Qualitative research may be particularly helpful in this instance. Other useful research may include the number of dietitians employed by the livestock industry in the South compared to other regions of the country; understanding exposure (or lack thereof) to diet-related climate change mitigation in training experiences and didactic education; and even understanding attitudes about energy sector jobs in the South.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our level of statistical significance was articulated at the outset of the study (
  <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.050), our logistic regression analysis found that the variable “Number of Years in Practice” approached statistical significance at 0.053. After holding all other variables constant, the odds of agreeing that climate change is an important issue negligibly declined with increasing number of years in practice. Further research is warranted to understand this trend. However, it is plausible that because climate change is a recently documented phenomenon, dietitians practicing longer may have spent less time being aware of climate change than more recently trained dietitians.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some practice-based publications have called upon registered dietitians to take action in their professional practice and personal lives to minimize the impact on the natural environment, including increasing plant-based protein consumption (
  <a rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40">40</a>, 
  <a rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41">41</a>). Interestingly, we found a significant relationship between the personal behaviors of being vegan or vegetarian and practice outcomes, as well as comfort in promoting solely plant-based diets. These findings have important implications for dietetics education, public health practice, and continuing education. Providing knowledge, skills, and experiences to increase skill and comfort in promoting plant-based meals among registered dietitians could make a difference with regard to practice-based recommendations. Dietitians in turn can share such skills across the healthcare, agriculture, food systems, environmental health, and the public health spectrum (
  <a rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3">3</a>, 
  <a rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18">18</a>, 
  <a rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51">51</a>). It is important also to note that dietitians were nearly divided with regard to the statement that animal products are 
  <span class="italic">essential</span> for a healthy diet. Thus, understanding dietitians’ beliefs about the role of animal products and plant-based foods may be key to understanding practice-based actions to reduce impact on the natural environment.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just over 10 percent (10.3%) of survey participants reported being vegetarian, while 2% reported being vegan. It has been estimated that over 2% of the American population is vegetarian, and just over 2% is vegan (
  <a rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52">52</a>). Dietitians participating in this survey reported being vegetarian in higher percentages than the general population, while those that reported being vegan is consistent with the general population.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, it is important to point out that although general messages to eat less animal products to mitigate climate change are appropriate and constructive, substantive recommendations, and meal planning advice are also warranted. Registered dietitians proficient in plant-based dietary patterns can offer suggestions across the entire lifecycle, disease conditions, and food planning and food procurement settings. For instance, non-governmental environmental organizations that are uncomfortable offering dietary advice as a way to reduce impact on the natural environment (
  <a rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" href="#B53">53</a>) may find great benefit in partnering with registered dietitians.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This may be the first study to examine concerns and actions regarding climate change among a randomly selected sample of all registered dietitians credentialed in the United States. It may also be the first to quantitatively examine the relationship between the personal behaviors with regard to climate change mitigation efforts. However, this study did not query those who intentionally restrict their respective intake of animal products who may be considered semi-vegetarian or “flexetarian,” which is worthy of future study. Because this was an exploratory study, further inquiry over time is necessary. It is important to note that those who completed the online survey may be different than those who did not complete the online survey. That is, they could have been a self-selected group that is more likely to be supportive of the topic than those that did not respond. Our response rate was low, and we do not know if all intended survey recipients received our email, as filters may have prevented our survey from reaching the respective dietitian’s email inbox. Furthermore, it could be that those who participated in the survey provided responses based on the nature of questions, termed social desirability bias (
  <a rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" href="#B54">54</a>). Lastly, further testing the reliability of our survey tool is important for future research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nutrition professionals are called upon to help improve planetary health. Because of their skill set and their unique role in healthcare and in all aspects of food and nutrition – registered dietitians are well positioned to become increasingly important allies in novel approaches to climate change mitigation strategies. Efforts that enable more registered dietitians to build knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy regarding diet-related climate change mitigation activities that they utilize in practice could substantially improve both public health and planetary health.</p>
