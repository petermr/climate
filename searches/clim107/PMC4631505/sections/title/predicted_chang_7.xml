 <div class="title">Predicted changes in mean summer temperature (a), mean summer precipitation (b) and precipitation as snow (c) according to three general circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2 (Can), CCSM4 (CCSM), and GFDL-CM3 (GFDL), and two IPCC emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) for Vancouver Island.</div>
 <p>The RCP 4.5 scenario is displayed using dotted lines while the RCP 8.5 scenario is displayed using solid lines. Line weights correspond to the three GCMs (thick = Can, medium = GFDL, thin = CCSM).</p>
