 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated baseline and future habitat area by multiplying the number of raster grid cells considered “suitable” in each predicted distribution by the area of each grid cell (0.01 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>). We assessed the potential effects of climate change on predicted distributions by evaluating potential net range change. Range change (RC) was calculated using the formula
