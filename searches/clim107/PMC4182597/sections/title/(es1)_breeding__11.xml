 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arctic temperatures are rising and are projected to further increase in the future, resulting in earlier spring thaws and ice melts 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1">[36]</a>. This likely will result in earlier invertebrate hatches because arctic invertebrate emergence is temperature dependent 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Sweeney1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Sweeney1">[86]</a>. Long–term field observations and recent experimental warming studies of arctic plots support this hypothesis

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Tulp1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Tulp1">[88]</a>. If birds are unable to alter migration timing, then arctic nesting shorebirds may have insufficient food resources for young.
