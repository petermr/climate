  <a rid="pone.0108899-Saino1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Saino1">[94]</a>. In the context of climate change, for example, migratory connectivity interacts with habitat loss from sea level rise

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Convertino1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Convertino1">[96]</a> and species may encounter more severe weather during migration

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Klaassen1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Klaassen1">[98]</a>. Our separation of species into distance categories was done by looking for natural breaks in the migration distance data, resulting in distances being divided into 5 categories (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0108899-g001" href="#pone-0108899-g001">Fig. 1</a>). Migration distances were calculated from the approximate center of each species' breeding range to the approximate center of each species' wintering range using data from NatureServe 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Ridgely1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Ridgely1">[99]</a>. The two exceptions were Bristle–thighed Curlew and Bar–tailed Godwit, which are not covered by this database. Known migration distances placed these species in the greatest–distance category.

   <div class="title">One-way migration distances calculated as mid–point to mid–point of their summer and winter geographic ranges.</div>
   <p>Ranges were downloaded from the NatureServe database. Horizontal lines separate dispersal distances as ranked in 
    <a rid="pone-0108899-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0108899-t001">Table 1</a>, with the shortest distances associated with rank 1 and the greatest distances with rank 5. The exceptions are the Bristle–thighed Curlew and Bar–tailed Godwit, which do not overwinter in the New World so they are not covered by the database. They fall into the greatest migration distance category, and are represented arbitrarily in the figure by the 2 points showing the greatest migration distances.
