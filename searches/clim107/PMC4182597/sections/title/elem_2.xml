 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included 49 species in our assessment. For three species (Willet, Piping and Snowy Plover) we evaluated two distinct populations each, so in all 52 taxa were evaluated. We excluded Eskimo Curlew (
  <span class="italic">Numenius borealis</span>) from our analysis because it is likely extinct 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-Elphick1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Elphick1">[34]</a>. Our assessments are compatible with both the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan and PIF frameworks, although because of the increased risk to some species already at the highest risk categories, we needed to add a new risk category – critical – to distinguish species at greatly increased risk.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To achieve the goal of creating a framework that could be integrated with both PIF and the U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, we first evaluated other existing approaches. The State of the Birds 
  <a rid="pone.0108899-North1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-North1">[35]</a> developed a framework to assess changes in risk due to climate change, with the goal of applying it to all bird species. They included migration distance and timing as bivariate factors (birds that migrate long distances and use daylight cues = 1; else 0); degree of breeding habitat obligation (high = 1 vs. not = 0); dispersal ability (1 vs. 0); niche specificity (1, 0); reproductive potential (lays one egg per year = 1, else 0); and habitat susceptibility (divided into 3 levels, 2, 1, 0, from highest to lowest susceptibility). Scores were summed to assess overall risk. This approach apparently ignores risks associated with migration and wintering habitat obligation, does not allow for extinction risk to decrease due to climate change, and there is heavy weighting of reproductive potential, which is evaluated on a narrow scale that distinguishes only between one–egg clutches and all other clutch sizes. Also, while reproductive potential may be important for population size recovery following sudden decline, it may be less important with respect to gradual climate change. This approach is applicable to other species included in the PIF prioritization system.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We included six factors in our risk framework, each of which had 3–5 risk levels. Factors included: expected losses or gains in (1) breeding, (2) migration, and (3) non–breeding habitat (4) degree of dependence on ecological synchronicities; (5) migration distance; and (6) degree of habitat specialization (on breeding, migration, and non–breeding grounds). All risk factors were given equal weight in the assessment, and each factor is described in detail below.</p>

   <a rid="pone.0108899-Chapin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Chapin1">[37]</a>. We then summarized, based on current understanding reported in the literature, the effects climatic change should have on habitats used by our focal shorebirds in the western hemisphere. What follows is our assessment of these changes (designated B1–B5), and brief statements about our confidence in these changes. These approximate confidence levels of &gt;70%, 30–70%, and &lt;30% are modified from the 5–category scale developed by 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Moss1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Moss1">[38]</a> for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report. We reduced the number of categories because we did not think the implied precision of 5 levels of confidence was defensible.

Although it is true that new areas of bare ground are likely to be created by ice cap and glacial recession in high tundra areas, we do not believe that this will result in more habitat for most breeding shorebirds since it will persist as gravel or bouldery moraine for a long period until vegetated and soil–forming processes can occur. Confidence = medium.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are also likely, but the aggregate effects on tundra hydrology are difficult to predict 
    <a rid="pone.0108899-Martin1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Martin1">[48]</a>. Drier overall conditions may be likely, and may reduce food availability during the breeding season

    <a rid="pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Intergovernmental1">[36]</a>. The result may be a loss of some wetland breeding habitat to dryer conditions, but this is unclear. Confidence = medium.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecological modeling based on climate change models indicates that increased aridification in South America will have the following effects: first it is likely to result in the replacement of currently forested areas in the Amazon by savanna habitat and seasonal forests

    <a rid="pone.0108899-Flinn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Flinn1">[75]</a>. As a result, young forests adjacent to fields or containing areas of open habitat are declining, resulting in loss of required breeding habitat. Additionally, climate change likely will result in increased vegetation growth at higher latitudes in North America

This will result in the establishment of more woody vegetation and a subsequent increase in young forest habitat in the north. It is unclear if northward expansion of the woodcock's range is occurring, so changes in forest landscape may outpace range expansion. Another potential concern for forest breeding habitat is climate change's impact on tree mortality. There is growing evidence that drought resulting from climate change leads to increased tree mortality

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Each risk factor was assessed for each species using information from the literature regarding the natural history of the species and anticipated changes due to climate change. A summary of each species' risk level associated with climate change for each risk factor narrative, as well as confidence scores can be found in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108899.s001" href="#pone.0108899.s001">Appendices S1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108899.s002" href="#pone.0108899.s002">S2</a>. For each risk factor, for each species, we also included a subjective confidence score (1 = low to 5 = high confidence). We recognize that a species might have increased extinction risk due to climate change, but it might not increase enough to change risk categories.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We described changes in risk using two systems: a numeric scoring system that had maximum values for each factor of 5, and a graphical depiction of the change in risk using arrows because we thought they were more intuitive for rapid visual assessment of changes and patterns. Risk factors were scaled from 0 to 5 to match PIF scaling. For the three habitat factors (1–3), we allowed for the possibility of improved conditions due to climate change. Improvement resulted in negative scores (or down–arrows) to show reduced risk. The factors, and their subdivision and scoring, are shown in 
   <a rid="pone-0108899-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0108899-t001">Table 1</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our purposes, we decided that an increase in risk score of 10 (equivalent to 4 ↑s; the arrows indicate the direction and degree of effect) was sufficient to increase by a single risk category because a score of 10 would mean that a species is at extreme risk in two of the six categories. This assignment is a first approximation based on best professional judgment cf. 
   <a rid="pone.0108899-Panjabi1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Panjabi1">[32]</a>, but should be revisited as more information about shorebird ecology and vulnerability to habitat changes becomes available.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To investigate the importance of our decision for how much change in risk is sufficient to cause a change in risk category, we did a sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we assessed the sensitivity of our results – which species were placed into which risk category – to the amount of change in extinction risk that was required for a species to change risk categories. We did this by making the criterion for changing categories more sensitive, requiring the accumulation of only 3 arrows to make the transition between risk categories. We also evaluated the effect of making the criterion less sensitive, evaluating the effects of requiring 5, 6 and 7 arrows to allow a species to change risk categories. If our method is insensitive to this criterion, we would expect little change in categorization with changing criteria.</p>
