 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic and regional information was measured with 2006 New Zealand census data, based on the smallest geographical units (meshblock) in the census. Respondents provided their residential address, and this information was used to determine the meshblock boundaries within which each resided (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103180-g001" href="#pone-0103180-g001">Figure 1</a>). The geographic size of meshblocks is related to population density, but each unit tends to cover a region containing roughly 100 residents (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 103, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 72, range = 3-1,431), and the average New Zealand meshblock size is about 9.66 km
  <span class="sup">2</span> (3.73 mi
  <span class="sup">2</span>). Respondents in the present study (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 5,815) were nested within 5,199 meshblocks, with a little over one person on average sampled per unit (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 1.12, range 1–5).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the distance to the coast by calculating the straight-line distance (in kilometers) between the centroid of each meshblock and the nearest point on the shoreline (
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 9.87 km, 
  <span class="italic">SD</span> = 17.01 km) using GIS analytic techniques. The distance was then assigned to all respondents living in the meshblock. Assigning respondents as if they all lived in the center of their meshblock is a reliable approximation because the majority of meshblocks are small 
  <a rid="pone.0103180-Statistics1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Statistics1">[49]</a>. We also estimated height above sea level for the centroid of each meshblock. To make the unstandardized slopes in our model more readily interpretable, distance to the coastline was scaled in 10 km units and height above sea level was scaled in meters.
