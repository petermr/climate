 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study analyzed data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), which is a larger longitudinal research project. The present article only focuses on the first wave of the NZAVS collected in 2009. The overall NZAVS project was approved by the University of Auckland Human Ethics Committee (IRB approved). The first phases of this longitudinal study were approved on 09-September-2009 for 3 years, reference number: 2009/336. Ethics approval for the study was re-approved by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on 17-February-2012 until 09-September-2015. Reference number: 6171. NZAVS data is hosted at the University of Auckland. Contact details are removed when the questionnaires are received. All data were de-identified before analyses were conducted. The de-identified data is available to appropriately qualified researchers upon request for the purposes of re-analysis. The syntax for the models reported in this paper can be found at

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The NZAVS-09 questionnaire was posted to 40,500 New Zealanders randomly selected from the 2009 New Zealand electoral roll. Roughly 1.36% of all people registered to vote were contacted and invited to participate. The NZAVS-09 contained responses from 6,518 participants, with a response rate of 16.6% 
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Sibley2" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Sibley2">[38]</a>. Complete data for all exogenous measures analyzed here were available for 5,815 participants (missing data among the two endogenous measures was estimated using Full Information Maximum Likelihood).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sample consisted of 60% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 3,487) women and 40% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 2,328) men, with a mean age of 47.72 (
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 15.60). With regard to education, 22.3% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,295) had no formal qualifications or did not report the qualification, 29.4% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,709) had some high school, 16.2% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 941) had a post-high school diploma or certificate, 23.0% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 1,335) had completed or were studying toward an undergraduate degree, and 9.2% (
   <span class="italic">n</span> = 535) had or were studying toward a post-graduate qualification. Participants' mean annual household income was $NZ 84,604 (
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 70,629). Missing values for household income were replaced with the mean. To make the unstandardized slopes more interpretable, income was scaled in $10,000 units in the multilevel analyses.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In comparison to national census figures, the NZAVS data have overall more women and older, educated and wealthier respondents than the general New Zealand public 
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Sibley3" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Sibley3">[39]</a>. These differences are common among samples taken from household surveys. Given that women, more educated, and wealthier individuals are generally more likely to be environmentally engaged 
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Fairbrother1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Fairbrother1">[40]</a>–
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Zelezny1">[48]</a>, it is possible that our sample's responses on the outcome measures were higher than the general public's would be.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Political orientation was indexed by asking participants to rate their political orientation on a single-item scale from 1 (
   <span class="italic">extremely conservative</span>) to 7 (
   <span class="italic">extremely liberal</span>). Scores were reverse coded so that a higher score indicated greater political conservatism (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic and regional information</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic and regional information was measured with 2006 New Zealand census data, based on the smallest geographical units (meshblock) in the census. Respondents provided their residential address, and this information was used to determine the meshblock boundaries within which each resided (see 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0103180-g001" href="#pone-0103180-g001">Figure 1</a>). The geographic size of meshblocks is related to population density, but each unit tends to cover a region containing roughly 100 residents (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 103, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 72, range = 3-1,431), and the average New Zealand meshblock size is about 9.66 km
   <span class="sup">2</span> (3.73 mi
   <span class="sup">2</span>). Respondents in the present study (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 5,815) were nested within 5,199 meshblocks, with a little over one person on average sampled per unit (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 1.12, range 1–5).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We estimated the distance to the coast by calculating the straight-line distance (in kilometers) between the centroid of each meshblock and the nearest point on the shoreline (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 9.87 km, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 17.01 km) using GIS analytic techniques. The distance was then assigned to all respondents living in the meshblock. Assigning respondents as if they all lived in the center of their meshblock is a reliable approximation because the majority of meshblocks are small 
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Statistics1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Statistics1">[49]</a>. We also estimated height above sea level for the centroid of each meshblock. To make the unstandardized slopes in our model more readily interpretable, distance to the coastline was scaled in 10 km units and height above sea level was scaled in meters.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regional affluence</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also examined information about the net deprivation versus affluence of people residing in each meshblock. To measure deprivation we used the 2006 Deprivation Index, which provides detailed aggregate census information about the demographic characteristics of people residing in each area unit/neighborhood in New Zealand 
   <a rid="pone.0103180-Salmond1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Salmond1">[50]</a>. This index allocates a deprivation score to each meshblock based on the following nine variables in the census data (in weighted order): proportion of adults receiving a means-tested Government-supplied welfare benefit, household income, proportion not owning their own home, proportion of single-parent families, proportion unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion with household crowding, proportion with no telephone access, and proportion with no car access. The Deprivation Index thus reflects the average level of deprivation for neighborhoods (or small community areas) across the entire country. The Deprivation Index assigns a ranked decile score from 1 (most affluent) to 10 (most impoverished) to each geographical meshblock unit/neighborhood (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dependent measures: Climate change belief and support for emissions regulation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The two outcome measures were measured with single-item questions and were embedded in a larger battery of Likert-type questions rated on scale from 1 (
   <span class="italic">strongly disagree</span>) to 7 (
   <span class="italic">strongly agree</span>). Belief about the reality of climate change was assessed using the single item “Climate change is real” (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 5.37, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.68). Support for government regulation of carbon emissions policy was assessed using the single item “The New Zealand government should be involved in regulating carbon emissions” (
   <span class="italic">M</span> = 4.84, 
   <span class="italic">SD</span> = 1.68). Previous analyses of these two items focusing on their links with behavior intentions and overall distribution in the population have been reported elsewhere

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that these measures, like many psychological measures, are self-reported and therefore potentially subject to socially desirable responding, in which participants may exaggerate responses according to what they believe to be approved by others or what the researchers want to hear. However, this bias, especially for a household survey in which the researcher is not physically present, is unlikely to significantly affect results. Additionally, it is extremely unlikely that any participants guessed the purpose of the present study.</p>
