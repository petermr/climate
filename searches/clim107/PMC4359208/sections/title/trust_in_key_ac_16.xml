 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our findings on trust have important implications for outreach to farmers and the agricultural community. First, the results imply that Iowa farmers are heterogeneous in terms of whom they trust on climate change. Many farmers expressed trust in environmentally oriented organizations as sources of information about climate change (

In other words, such farmers are concerned and open to adaptive and mitigative action.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, farmers who express higher levels of trust in agricultural interests are less likely to believe in climate change, much less anthropogenic causes. These results provide evidence that the “manufacturing of uncertainty” that has played a role in shaping the general public’s beliefs about climate change (

As noted above, key agricultural interests have denied a connection between climate change and human activity; this study’s findings suggest that so-called “denial machine” tactics (

This result points to challenges and opportunities: If farmers trust farm groups and the agricultural press for information on climate change, it is critical that the climate research and policy community engage more with these groups, especially the farm press. While this might be difficult given the reluctance of some actors to engage in discussion of climate change and potential responses, because these groups may influence farmer beliefs and attitudes, working with them is imperative.
