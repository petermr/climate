 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model 2’s response variable is support for government action to reduce GHG emissions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916513503832" href="#fig2-0013916513503832">Figure 2</a>). The coefficient measuring the relationship between climate change belief and support for mitigation is positive and significant. This suggests that belief in climate change and attribution to human activities is associated with stronger support for government mitigation policy. On the other hand, the coefficient measuring the indirect effect through perceived risk is not significant.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive, direct effect of belief on support for mitigation indicates that farmers who believe that climate change is occurring tended to agree that public action on GHG reduction is appropriate, and those farmers who attribute climate change to human activity agree more strongly. These results support H4. Furthermore, the results suggest that trust in agricultural and environmentally oriented groups as sources of information about climate change have negative and positive indirect effects, respectively, on support for mitigation through climate change belief. The lack of significance for the path from perceived risk to mitigation suggests that risk perception does not mediate support for government action on GHGs.</p>
