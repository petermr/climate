For the Bayesian analysis, the posterior mean TLI can be computed from samples of the posterior distribution. The TLI for Model 1 is 0.784, and the TLI for Model 2 is 0.783, suggesting adequate fits. The models show key similarities in the relationships among trust, climate change belief, and perceived risk. The correlation between the two trust constructs (0.46) is measured to control for generalized trust, or the degree to which individuals tend to trust others (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression coefficients for climate change belief and attribution were significant. Trust in environmentally oriented interests is positively associated with belief, meaning that respondents who expressed trust in these groups as sources of information about climate change were more likely to believe that climate change is occurring and attributable to human sources. An opposite but somewhat weaker relationship was found between trust in agricultural interests and climate change belief. Respondents who expressed higher levels of trust in agricultural interests were relatively more likely to be uncertain or not believe that climate change is occurring. These structural coefficients support H1a and H1b.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, these mediated understandings of climate change had a direct effect on perceived risk. The significant and positive path coefficient between belief and perceived risk in both models indicates that farmers who believe climate change is occurring and associated with human activity expressed substantially higher levels of concern. These structural relationships between belief and perceived climate risk support H2.</p>
