 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, beliefs about climate change and perceived risks were related to farmer support for adaptive actions. Model 1 incorporates support for adaptive action as a response variable, and models both direct and indirect effects of beliefs on support for adaptive action (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916513503832" href="#fig1-0013916513503832">Figure 1</a>). The coefficient for the path from perceived risk to support for adaptive action is positive and significant, indicating that individuals with higher than average levels of perceived risk tend to have higher levels of support for adaptation. Although smaller in magnitude, the coefficient measuring the direct effect of belief on support for adaptation is negative and significant. However, the paths from belief to perceived risk and from risk to adaptation are significant and positive. The total effect is positive, indicating a strong indirect effect on support for adaptation through perceived risk. In other words, farmers who had higher scores on the ordinal climate change belief scale 
  <span class="italic">and</span> perceived higher risks of negative impacts were more likely to endorse adaptive action. Overall, the model indicates that endorsement of adaptive action was associated primarily with higher levels of perceived risks. This result supports H3.
