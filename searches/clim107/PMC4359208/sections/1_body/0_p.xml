<p class="p">Global climate change is widely viewed as one of the most significant challenges facing society today. Agriculture is vulnerable to climate shifts and a significant source of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are driving those changes (

Long-term shifts in annual averages and seasonal patterns of precipitation, temperature, and humidity, as well as more erratic and extreme weather events leading to increased risk of floods, drought, and fire are anticipated for the future (

In contrast, production of GHGs has effects across the larger landscape that are not readily apparent at short time scales. It is estimated that agriculture contributes between 10% and 15% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions including nitrous oxide (N

Thus, climate-change-related threats to agriculture represent threats to quality of life at local and global scales, and calls for the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for agriculture are increasing in their urgency (e.g.,
