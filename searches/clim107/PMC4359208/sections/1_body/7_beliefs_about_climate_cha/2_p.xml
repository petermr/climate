<p class="p">Studies examining the relationships between beliefs about climate change and behavior or policy support have used varied and generally indirect measures of belief. 
 <xref rid="bibr17-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dietz et al. (2007)</xref> used two measures of “climate change information” consisting of (1) number of times respondents had obtained information specifically about climate change from various sources including newspapers, magazines, television, and the like and (2) a scale measure of how “well informed” about climate change respondents considered themselves to be.

 <xref rid="bibr58-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Connor, Bord, Yarnal, and Wiefek (2002)</xref> measured belief in climate change through a single-scale item rating the likelihood that average global temperatures would rise over the following 50 years, and measured understanding of causes through an index of several 3-point scales assessing the perceived role of several potential causes of climate change (e.g., heating and cooling homes). 
 <xref rid="bibr78-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zahran, Brody, Grover, and Vedlitz (2006</xref>, p. 779) used two climate change “knowledge” variables. The first was measured through true/false responses to two statements: “Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas” and, “The major cause of increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases is burning of fossil fuels.” 
 <xref rid="bibr12-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brody et al. (2012)</xref> used an index measure constructed from five true/false statements about climate change and its causes, including items regarding scientific certainty about sea-level rise and increases in global precipitation, whether fossil fuels increase atmospheric concentration of GHGs, and whether N
