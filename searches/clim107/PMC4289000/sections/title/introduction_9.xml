 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is considered one of the biggest threats to biodiversity today, and many species risk extinction due to a changed climate (Thomas et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">2004</a>; Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">2006</a>; Cahill et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">2013</a>). Species interactions make up an important part of biodiversity. Yet, knowledge of how such interactions are influenced by climate and habitat change is comparatively sparse (Lavergne et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">2010</a>). A change in climate or other environmental conditions may influence the strength of species interactions by relatively rapid plastic responses and by evolutionary changes over generations (Visser and Both 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2005</a>; Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2008</a>; Altermatt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2010</a>; Singer and Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2010</a>). For example, if the phenology of an herbivore and its host plants in a seasonal environment is differentially influenced by temperature, a change in climate may lead to changes in the temporal overlap between the herbivore and its hosts (e.g., Singer and Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2010</a>). As a result, the intensity of the interaction might change, or it may even disappear (Dewar and Watt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">1992</a>; Harrington et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">1999</a>). In herbivores using multiple hosts, climate change may lead to changes in the relative overlap with different hosts and thus to changes in host use. Such changes in interaction patterns are important to study as they influence both population dynamics and selection regimes, and are fundamental to understand how climate change might influence natural communities (Visser 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">2008</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A clear trend among many temperate species, including birds, plants and insects, during the past decades is that they have started to reproduce earlier during the spring and summer (Walther et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">2002</a>; Menzel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2006</a>; Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>). Butterflies are temperature sensitive and all their life history stages are influenced by temperature (e.g., Dennis 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">1993</a>; Karlsson and Wiklund 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">2005</a>). Several studies have observed positive correlations between ambient temperatures during growth and development and date of the adult flight period, with an average advancement around 4 days/°C (Sparks and Yates 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1997</a>; Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). Some authors have also documented recent advancements in butterfly phenology in response to a warmer climate (Sparks and Yates 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1997</a>; Stefanescu et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">2003</a>; Menzel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">2006</a>; Altermatt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2010</a>; Diamond et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>; Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, recent comparative studies of butterflies in the UK (Diamond et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>) and in Sweden (Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>) reveal that shifts in phenology show a profound variation among species, making a more thorough inspection of the phenological responses justified. Previous studies have shown that variation in phenology shifts among butterfly species is associated with several life history traits, including overwintering stage, seasonal appearance, food plant species as well as several other factors, like food availability, habitat, altitude, and latitude (Altermatt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2010</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2012</a>; Diamond et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>; Illán et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">2012</a>; Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). For example, species overwintering as adults or as pupae tend to advance their phenology more than species overwintering as larvae or in their egg stage (Altermatt 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">2010</a>; Diamond et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>; Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Butterflies critically depend on plants as larval hosts and for nectar, and it is likely that optimal butterfly phenology in many cases strongly depends on the phenology of their host plants. Butterflies and host plants may respond differently to a warming climate, either because they use partly different cues or because their sensitivity to given cues differ (e.g., Menzel and Fabian 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">1999</a>; Menzel et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">2001</a>; Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">2007</a>). Moreover, the direct effects of increased availability of CO
  <sub>2</sub> may affect plant phenology more than the insects that use them as a resource. The relative importance of cues also varies among plants species (e.g., Rathcke and Lacey 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">1985</a>), which may result in climate-dependent variation in relative abundances of different host species during the period of reproduction and growth of the butterflies (Schweiger et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">2008</a>). Such differences in reaction norms should lead to changes in species interactions with changes in climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given that butterflies are strongly selected to maximize synchrony with their host plants and that host plants to some extent differ from each other and from butterflies in their response to increased temperatures, we expect butterfly responses to be related to the specific set of host plants that they depend on. For example, Diamond et al. (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">2011</a>) showed that butterfly species with a small diet breadth, i.e., with only a few species of larval host plants, have higher advancement rates compared to species with a large repertoire of host plants. It can also be expected that butterfly species that feed exclusively on specific developmental stages of their hosts, e.g., flowers, young fruits, or young leaves, shift their phenology more strongly in response to warming than species that are not restricted to specific developmental stages.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An additional factor affecting plant and animal phenology is geographic location. The effects of latitude have been extensively scrutinized, and due to climate gradients stretching from south to north, growth and reproduction are generally occurring later in the northern parts (e.g., Myneni et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">1997</a>; Karlsen et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">2007</a>; Rötzer and Chmielewski 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">2001</a>; Doi and Takahashi 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">2008</a>). Butterflies show a relatively straightforward pattern with northern populations flying at later dates (Roy and Asher 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">2003</a>; Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). However, not only phenology may vary along latitudinal gradients, but also the relative importance of different cues. Such differences would imply that plant populations of the same species along a latitudinal gradient respond differently to climate warming. This may lead to different responses among butterfly populations in order to maximize synchronization. Moreover, many butterfly species depend on multiple host plants, which use partly different environmental cues for start of development and that vary in relative abundance along latitudinal gradients. In combination, these relationships suggest that the realized pattern of host use will be affected by variation in climate, whether it is due to latitudinal differences or to long-term climate change. Such climate effects on host use are likely to be particularly important in butterfly species that are specializing on feeding on a specific phenological stage of their hosts. However, the effects of climate variation on patterns of host utilization in phenological specialists have rarely been studied. Indeed, detailed data on climate-induced changes of insect–host plant interactions over long periods of time are overall very rare (Visser and Both 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">2005</a>; Singer and Parmesan 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">2010</a>). One way forward is therefore to explore spatial variation in butterfly–host interactions along the climatic gradients of latitude or altitude.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we review phenological changes in temperate butterflies over the last decades in Sweden and present results from an ongoing project exploring variation in the interaction between one phenological specialist, 
  <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span>, and its multiple host plants along a latitudinal cline representing large variation in climate. More specifically we ask (1) How much has mean flight date changed in butterfly species in general, and in 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> in particular, during the last 20 years in the same geographical area? (2) How well do temporal changes in mean flight dates for these species agree with the spatial trend along a latitudinal gradient? (3) To what degree do life history traits such as voltinism and overwintering stage correlate with changes in mean flight dates of butterflies in general? and (4) How does among- and within-species host plant use in 
  <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span> differs along a latitudinal gradient?
