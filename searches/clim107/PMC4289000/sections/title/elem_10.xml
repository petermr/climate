  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focal butterfly species in this study, the Orange-tip 
   <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span> (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and its host plant species constitute a particularly interesting model system to assess potential climate-dependent effects on host use. This butterfly is oligophagous on Brassicaceae using up to 17 different Brassicaceae species from 14 different genera within their range in Sweden (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1978</a>; Arvanitis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2007</a>). The species is a phenological specialist in the sense that it feeds only on flowers and seedpods of its host, which are available for a period of approximately 1 month in spring at any given location in Sweden (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1978</a>; Wiklund and Friberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>). As a result of its dependence of host plants that flower relatively early, 
   <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> flies early in the season (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Although both the butterfly and its host plants have a wide distribution in Europe, 
   <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> is obligatory univoltine and after larval development in spring, it pupates and enters diapause in early summer. Thus, the species spends most of the summer, and all of autumn and winter in the pupal stage.

  </div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For our study of latitudinal variation in host plant use of 
   <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span>, we included six host plant species: two perennial herbs: 
   <span class="italic">Cardamine pratensis</span> L. and 
   <span class="italic">Arabis hirsuta</span> (L.) Scop., one biennial: 
   <span class="italic">A. glabra</span> (L.) Bernh., and three annuals: 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> (L.) Heynh., 
   <span class="italic">Capsella bursa</span>-
   <span class="italic">pastoris</span> (L.) Medik., and 
   <span class="italic">Thlaspi caerulescens</span> (J. Presl and C. Presl). 
   <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span> grows on meadows, marshes, ditches, and stream margins (Arvanitis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2007</a>), whereas the other species use different habitats such as meadows, hillocks, rocks, and roadsides (Wiklund and Friberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>). 
   <span class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</span> and 
   <span class="italic">T. caerulescens</span> are the earliest species, flowering from March to April, and 
   <span class="italic">A. glabra</span> and 
   <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span> are the latest ones (June–July). 
   <span class="italic">Capsella bursa</span>-
   <span class="italic">pastoris</span> has an extended flowering period (April to October) (Mossberg and Stenberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2010</a>). We distinguished between the tetraploid 
   <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span> ssp. 
   <span class="italic">pratensis</span> (hereafter, 
   <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span>) and the octoploid 
   <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span> ssp. 
   <span class="italic">paludosa</span> (Knaf) Květ. (hereafter, 
   <span class="italic">C. paludosa</span>), based on flower size and the type of cauline leaves (Arvanitis et al. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">2007</a>). These seven plant taxa span along the Swedish coast but their abundance varies from South to North (Mossberg and Stenberg 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">2010</a>). A latitudinal delay in flowering from South to North within each species is expected as a consequence of the average monthly temperature, which is roughly correlated with the plant growing season (Sjörs 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">1999</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected between 17 May and 16 June 2010. We selected three regions ranging a 900 km S–N climatic gradient along the Eastern Swedish coast (Electronic Supplementary Material, Fig. 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7): regions South (Scania Province; 55°49′N, 14°05′E), Centre (Uppland; 59°30′N, 18°35′E), and North (Ångermanland; 63°03′N, 18°19′E). We sampled consecutively in S (17–23 May), in C (28 May–3 June), and N (10–16 June). Within each region, 1–11 populations per host plant species were sampled in an area of approximately 50 km

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We sampled data both at the level of plots and at the level of plant individuals. In each region, we searched randomly for occurrences of host plants. Whenever patches of one or multiple host plants were found, we established study plots. A plot was defined as the area covered by a patch of single or mixed host species populations, which was separated from the closest patch by at least 25 m. We judge that this design resulted in that differences in abundances among species in surveyed plots, roughly reflected abundances within the larger study region. At the plot level, we estimated the plot area including all the host plants in a patch as well as the total number of host plant individuals per species, yielding estimates of densities for each of the host plant species. Plot area ranged from 18 to 5382 m
   <span class="sup">2</span>. We searched all plants within plots for presence of butterfly eggs and estimated the mean number of eggs per plant within each plot as the total number of eggs divided by the number of plants individuals. At the individual level, we measured traits for a random subsample of the plants scored for each population. In populations with less than 100 plants, all plants were measured, whereas random samples of up to 150 plants were measured in larger populations. The measured traits were plant size (maximum shoot length), the total number of flowers on all shoots (total number of buds + flowers + pods at the time of recording), and the phenological state (number of pods divided by the total number of flowers at the time of recording). Overall, 16 453 plants were scored for egg presence at the plot level, and for 6187 of these, we also measured phenotypic traits (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Lastly, we used the database from the Swedish Species Gateway to assess how our sampling periods in S, C, and N regions were related to local butterfly phenology within each region.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the plot level, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian error structure and identity link function to study the effects of region and host species identity on the mean number of eggs per plant. Intra-specific host plant density was included in the model as a covariate. The mean number of eggs per plant was log-transformed, and its variation among regions and host species was examined with analysis of deviance. We also examined models including the summed density of all other potential host plant species in the plots. However, inter-specific host plant density had no significant (
   <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.25) effect on the mean number of eggs in a given species and was not included in the presented models.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the individual level, we used GLMs with binomial error structure and logit link function to study the effects of host region, size, and phenology on egg presence (0 or 1). The two predictor variables, size and phenology, were the principal components PC1 and PC2, respectively, extracted from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the traits plant size, inflorescence size, and phenological state. We used PC1 and PC2 instead of the traits because original trait values were correlated (Pearson, 
   <span class="italic">r</span> &gt; 0.25, 
   <span class="italic">P</span> ≤ 0.05). PC1 and PC2 explained 48.4 and 32.7% of the variance, respectively (accumulated explained variance = 81.1%). PC1 was positively correlated with the plant size and total number of flowers, whereas PC2 was correlated with the phenological state. PCA loadings for the three host plant traits are shown in Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7 (Electronic Supplementary Material). As preliminary analyses detected significant interactions between region and traits for some species, we evaluated effects of trait variables in separate models for each region.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean ± SE in figures and tables is based on untransformed data. All GLMs were performed with R version 2.6.2 (R Core Team
