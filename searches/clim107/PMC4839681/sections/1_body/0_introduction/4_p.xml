In UZ, the mountain conifer forests are confined to the northern Pamir-Alay in the southeast and western Tien Shan ranges in the northwest of the country. Due to political unrest and restricted accessibility, only one dendroclimatological investigation has been conducted in the past decades [

For spruce, distinct and statistically significant trends in climate response as a function of elevation were detected, where spruce growth benefits from warm temperatures at high elevations, while it is limited by water supply at low altitudes [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, the impact of climate on juniper has been shown to be less clear, e.g. [
