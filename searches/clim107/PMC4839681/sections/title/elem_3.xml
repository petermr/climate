 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 2012 and 2013, 1069 juniper trees were sampled at 33 sites ranging from 1267 to 3020 m above sea level (asl) within the 68.49°–78.37°E and 39.63°–42.24°N domain (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" href="#pone.0153888.s001">S1 Table</a>). The sampling was conducted with permission from local forestry districts and National Parks in eight regions located in the northwestern (Zaamin, UZ), northern (Khaidarkan and Kyrgyz Ata, KG) Pamir-Alay, western (Chimgan, UZ; Sari Chelek, KG) and the central (Karakuldja, Naryn and Karakol, KG) Tien Shan mountain systems stretching from west (eastern UZ) to east (all of KG) across our study area (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). We selected juniper sites close to or at the local upper and lower tree lines (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" href="#pone.0153888.s001">S1 Table</a>) to get a better understanding of juniper climate responses along elevational gradients.

   <p>Westerly winds (A; orange arrow in inset) dominate the study area causing continental climatic conditions at the sites. Climate charts show absolute annual (numbers) and monthly temperature means (red shades) and precipitation sums (blue shades) for all CRU grid points for each region over the period 1961–1990. Monsoonal influences (blue arrows) are depicted for the Indian Summer Monsoon (B) and East Asian Summer Monsoon (C), respectively, while ITCZ stands for Intertropical Convergence Zone (purple line; after Lutgens and Tarbuck, 2001 [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate in the study area is controlled by two pressure systems: during winter, a northeasterly inflow of cold air originates from the Siberian High, and in summer, the eastern extension of the Azores High causes a northwesterly inflow of, by then, dry air. Thus, the climate is extremely continental with cold winters, hot/dry summers, and a precipitation maximum in spring (see climate charts in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). A decreasing aridity trend from west to east during summer can be observed, altering the climate from semi-arid (until Naryn, central KG) to wet continental at the most eastern region in KG (Karakol; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). Moreover, at the highest elevation sites (&gt; ~2500 m asl), the climate is strongly affected by altitude displaying a more alpine climate regime, especially in Khaidarkan, Karakuldja, Naryn and Karakol with low annual temperatures (annual temperature averages are given in the climate charts in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>).

  <a rid="pone.0153888.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref032">32</a>]). While juniper forests are highly abundant in eastern UZ and western KG, they are successively replaced by spruce (
  <span class="italic">Picea</span> sp.) in central KG and eastwards. At its eastern distribution limit in KG, only fragmented patches of juniper occur, where the trees often develop prostate stem forms.
