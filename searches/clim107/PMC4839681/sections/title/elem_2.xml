  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 2012 and 2013, 1069 juniper trees were sampled at 33 sites ranging from 1267 to 3020 m above sea level (asl) within the 68.49°–78.37°E and 39.63°–42.24°N domain (

The sampling was conducted with permission from local forestry districts and National Parks in eight regions located in the northwestern (Zaamin, UZ), northern (Khaidarkan and Kyrgyz Ata, KG) Pamir-Alay, western (Chimgan, UZ; Sari Chelek, KG) and the central (Karakuldja, Naryn and Karakol, KG) Tien Shan mountain systems stretching from west (eastern UZ) to east (all of KG) across our study area (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). We selected juniper sites close to or at the local upper and lower tree lines (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate in the study area is controlled by two pressure systems: during winter, a northeasterly inflow of cold air originates from the Siberian High, and in summer, the eastern extension of the Azores High causes a northwesterly inflow of, by then, dry air. Thus, the climate is extremely continental with cold winters, hot/dry summers, and a precipitation maximum in spring (see climate charts in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). A decreasing aridity trend from west to east during summer can be observed, altering the climate from semi-arid (until Naryn, central KG) to wet continental at the most eastern region in KG (Karakol; 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>). Moreover, at the highest elevation sites (&gt; ~2500 m asl), the climate is strongly affected by altitude displaying a more alpine climate regime, especially in Khaidarkan, Karakuldja, Naryn and Karakol with low annual temperatures (annual temperature averages are given in the climate charts in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" href="#pone.0153888.g001">Fig 1</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the 1935–2011 period common to all TRW data, we compared climate, tree growth and the growth-climate relationship from the earliest, 1935–1964, to the most recent, 1982–2011 period. This was done to attempt to find a causal link between juniper growth and climate response to observed changes in climate during the 20
   <span class="sup">th</span> century. For the climate data, anomalies of temperature and precipitation from each CRU grid point were used to produce means for the most contrasting seasons: for winter (previous year December to current year February, pDJF) and summer (June–August, JJA). Changes in juniper growth were calculated by averaging the TRW indices over the two 30-year periods. We used Pearson correlation statistics to investigate the growth-climate relationships for the full 1935–2011 and the two shorter (1935–1964, 1982–2011) sub-periods. This was done using monthly climate values, as well as the seasonal temperature means and precipitation sums. Additionally, both TRW chronologies and climate data were high-pass filtered using a 10 year spline to investigate the growth-climate relationship during summer in the high-frequency domain.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To examine spatial and temporal changes in winter and summer climate, annual tree growth, and climate-growth responses to summer temperature and precipitation, the period differences were entered as point data in ArcMAP 10.1 [
   <a rid="pone.0153888.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref043">43</a>]. Areas with no data coverage were estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique [
   <a rid="pone.0153888.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0153888.ref044">44</a>]. This method fills missing cell values using a distance-weighted average of neighboring points. The power parameter 
   <span class="italic">p</span> defines the influence of the weights. We used twelve neighboring points and 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 2, to give higher weights to closer points and progressively decreasing weights to distant points.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of elevation on the climate data, the so-called lapse rate, was neglected in the study since we used interpolated grid point data. However, changes in tree growth and climate sensitivity were analyzed as a function of altitude.</p>
