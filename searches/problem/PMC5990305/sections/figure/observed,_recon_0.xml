   <span class="bold">A</span>) Monthly GST anomalies (January 1891 to September 2017) from the three analyses that make up the WMO data set and the WMO average. Shown are the two warming and three slowdown periods. Estimated 95% confidence limits on the WMO data set are shown in brown. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Reconstructions of monthly GST 1891–2015 from each of the various forcing factors. This uses the average of 81,000 cross-validated regression equations calculated from data covering this whole period. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) (a) Average cross-validated reconstruction (red) of observed monthly WMO GST (black) for the whole period 1891–2015. (b) As in (a) but using the CMIP5 40 model average (blue) of monthly GST.
