The historical QRA series calculated from [Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)] surface temperature observations from 1894 to 1916 (cyan) and the actual series of annual QRA event counts (green) from 1979 to 2015 (as diagnosed from ERA reanalysis data; see Materials and methods for further details) are shown for comparison.
