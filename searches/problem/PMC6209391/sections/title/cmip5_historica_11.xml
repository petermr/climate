  </a>) multimodel ensemble simulations, including both the anthropogenic + natural forced simulations (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 164 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 48 models) and anthropogenic-only forced simulations (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 40 realizations, 
  <span class="italic">M</span> = 10 models) spanning 1861–2005 (table S1). Each physics version of a model was considered a separate model. The analysis was limited to the common time period of overlap for all models and realizations (1861–2005). Those with a start year later than 1861 were not included in the analysis. We used a simple area-weighted average to create zonal means at a 5° interval (
