  <p>Present-day/pre-industrial ratio in ice core and modelled black carbon concentrations. Shown are two Greenland sites (D4 and NM), one North American site at Wyoming (WY), and one Swiss Alps site at Colle Gnifetti (CG). Bias factor in the present-day/pre-industrial (PD/PI) ratio for each modelled fire emission scenario (D4: red bars, NM: gold bars, WY: black bars, CG: blue bars). For model M and observation O the symmetric bias factor was calculated as: For M &gt; O: (M/O)–1; For O &gt; M: –(O/M) + 1. The AeroCom bias factor at the WY site is off the scale and shown as an arrow with its bias factor given. Measured PD/PI values shown as horizontal bars (±standard error of the mean bound Greenland estimates, see Methods) with the model simulations PD/PI ratio shown as dots (D4: red, NM: gold, WY: black, CG: blue). The WY and CG modelled ratio changes are scaled by a factor of 1.6 (1.2–2.0 in bias factor panel) and 2.0 (1.5–2.5 in bias factor panel) respectively to account for the change in BC concentration emissions near the site between the period of the PD measurement and the modelled concentration (see Methods). The AeroCom and CMIP6 changes at the WY and CG sites are off the scale and shown as open circles with the PD/PI ratio given</p>
