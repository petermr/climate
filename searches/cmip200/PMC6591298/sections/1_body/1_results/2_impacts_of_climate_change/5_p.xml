<p id="Par16" class="p">Underlying these aggregate changes are shifts in the various sectors’ demands for different energy carriers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). The most important contributors to changes in global demand are industry and services (both net positive). The contributions of residences and especially agriculture are small and net negative. For residence, this is due to the lack of significant elasticities in our data set. For agriculture, this differs from the scarce existing literature

 </sup>, as we include multiple energy carriers that change in opposite directions. Electricity demand expands in every sector. Commercial electricity accounts for 80% of the global total climate-driven energy demand increase. Sectoral changes in natural gas demand are small and offset one another (positive in industry and negative in households). These impacts differ only slightly across socioeconomic scenarios, with households and services exhibiting the largest variation. Differences among ESM realizations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, error bars) are much larger. The cross-ESM distributions of demand impacts for industry, services, and the economy-wide total are long-tailed—particularly for electricity relative to other energy carriers—with a small number of climate model projections accounting for large increases in demand. The balance between increased cooling demand and decreased heating demand determines the net impact at the regional scale (see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for details). For Europe, the heating effect (RCP 4.5: −9 to 11%, RCP 8.5: −11 to14%) dominates the cooling effect (RCP 4.5: 4%, RCP 8.5: 10–12%), yielding a net decrease in the total final energy demand under moderate warming and a small net positive or negative impact under vigorous warming. In all other regions, climate change increases the total final energy use, with a 75th percentile impact between 45 and 75% across sectors and energy carriers in the Americas, the Middle East, and Asia under vigorous warming (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
