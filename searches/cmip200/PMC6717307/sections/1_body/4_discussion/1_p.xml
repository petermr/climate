<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Our regional modeling indicates that climate change will exacerbate future air pollution mortality in China. This finding is generally consistent with previous studies despite differences in modeled time periods, scenarios, regions, climate-chemistry models used, and population and baseline mortality projections (
