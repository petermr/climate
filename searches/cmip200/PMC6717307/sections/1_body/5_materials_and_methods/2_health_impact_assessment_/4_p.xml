 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>), in which every 10-ppb increase in seasonal (ozone season) average of daily 1-h maximum ozone is associated with a 4% increase in respiratory disease mortality. We follow the definition of ozone season (6 mo, April to September) used in previous studies (

 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>), and do not consider the potential change in the length of the ozone season. Climate change in the future may lead to an extension of the ozone season, which will result in longer exposure to high ozone levels, and thus may increase the risk of diseases. By restricting our analysis to the 6-mo ozone season, we may therefore underestimate the health impacts of ozone in a changing climate with a longer ozone season. Further epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate that possibility. Note that our estimates of air pollution-related mortality also consider uncertainty in the RRs. For PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, we use the parameter values of Burnett et al. (
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>) to conduct 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations and then calculate the average and the 95% CIs. For ozone, we use the average and the 95% CIs for RR reported by Jerrett et al. (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>).
