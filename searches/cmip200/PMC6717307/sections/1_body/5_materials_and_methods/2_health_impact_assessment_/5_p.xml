<p class="p">The baseline mortality data in 2010 are derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). The gridded population data are obtained from the LandScan global population database. We primarily assume no demographic change for the mortality calculation but also include a sensitivity study (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), where we assess the effect of expected demographic changes. For the sensitivity study, future population projections and age structures are obtained from the medium variant scenario of the United Nations Population Division. The baseline mortality for 2050 is projected based on the International Futures (
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). The sensitivity to future population and mortality rate is intended to reflect the sensitivity to expected demographic changes.
