  <p class="p">Probability density functions (pdfs) of global mean surface temperature change required for September Arctic sea ice to effectively vanish. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Pdfs for runs with and without interactions (to illustrate the effects of accounting for model interactions). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Pdfs from all runs accounting for interactions, to illustrate the impact of different assumptions. Vertical dotted line: lower desirable warming limit of 1.5° under the Paris agreement. The projections are sensitive to the datasets used, and to the assumptions about the cause of the recent Arctic sea ice decline. There is a distinct probability that keeping global warming below the 1.5° target of the Paris agreement may not be enough to stave off an essential disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice. The figure illustrates the capacity of the method to make predictions of a variable of interest conditioned on a set of non-exclusive hypotheses while accounting for all orders of hypothesis interactions
