<p id="Par22" class="p">To run Maxent we used 10,000 background points, added samples to background, set auto features, and the regularization multiplier was set to 1. We allowed the creation of response curves, ran jackknife to measure variable importance (i.e. percent contribution and permutation importance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]), activated Logscale raw/cumulative pictures, background predictions and verbose. Taking into account the number of occurrences of both species, cross-validation was replicated 15 times for 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> and only three times for 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic>; these numbers of replicates (k) corresponded to the number of independent subsets, used for training (k minus 1 subset), and evaluation of the model (using the remaining subset), with a maximum of 500 iterations. We used the average distribution map as output with logistic format for data values. Assuming niche conservation, the projections were performed using strict model transference between calibrated models and their current and projected future climate conditions. To this end, we deactivated clamping and extrapolation in Maxent, as recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. The performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. The AUC ranges from 0.5 for a model that performs no better than chance to 1.0 if the model fits perfectly. The AUC quantifies the degree to which the model identifies presences more accurately than random [
