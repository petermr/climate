<p id="Par24" class="p">For binary prediction of suitability (presence/absence) we used the minimum training presence threshold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]; that is, the lowest predicted suitability value corresponding to an occurrence of each species in their respective M [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. Once the binary predictions were obtained in QGIS Desktop v.2.18.19, we used two different approaches to calculate the suitability for each RCP. The first approach used the Boolean logic operator “OR”, allowing that if at least one of the GCM results for the same RCP resulted in a suitable cell, it was considered suitable for that RCP; this was the higher public health risk situation. The second approach involved the Boolean logic operator “AND”, forcing suitability in all five GCM results for the same RCP to retain the cell as suitable, conforming the lower public health risk situation. After this, we compared the resulting raster of the RCPs from each approach with the current potential distribution, obtaining two maps per RCP showing stable areas (present in the current potential distribution and in the resulting future climatic model), retraction areas (present in the current potential distribution but absent in the future projection) and expansion areas (absent in the current distribution but present in the modelled future scenario). The areas corresponding to each category were calculated using r.report tool in QGIS Desktop v.2.18.19. Maps were elaborated using publicly available shapefiles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>], our compiled occurrences, and the processed outputs of Maxent and NicheToolBox, in QGIS Desktop v.2.18.19. A complete summary of all used methods is depicted in a flow diagram included as Additional file
