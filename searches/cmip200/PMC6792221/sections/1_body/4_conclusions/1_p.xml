<p id="Par46" class="p">The climate requirements of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> are mostly related to annual precipitation and mean temperature of the warmest quarter. Its potential distribution was projected to semi-arid and Mediterranean climates, fitting the known distribution of this species, located in inland valleys of arid and semiarid climate and, to a lesser extent, along the coast. The SDM of 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> was built mainly with mean temperature diurnal range. The potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> was limited to areas with coastal desert climate of Chile and Peru. Additional sampling and surveillance are required to corroborate if these vectors are inhabiting areas detected as currently suitable by our models but still have no reports of their presence. Under climate change scenarios, 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> would mainly conserve their current distributions, and expand to zones with similar climates. However, the biotic features (e.g. host and refuge availability) in these areas could be restricting factors that will need to be considered when generating vector control programs. Prevention campaigns should be anticipated in areas where historically no wild triatomines have been reported, and control measures must be established and/or reinforced in areas where these triatomines are expected to persist.
