<p id="Par14" class="p">In general, a disease transmission system is composed of a set of species that interact in hosting and vectoring a pathogen in space [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], and all the component species have a unique biogeography related to its ecological niche (i.e. those conditions appropriate for its survival and reproduction), interactions with other species and accessible areas over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Therefore, a large part of disease transmission risk corresponds to the intersection of the distributional areas of the species involved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>].
