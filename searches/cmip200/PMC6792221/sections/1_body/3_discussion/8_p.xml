<p id="Par41" class="p">In this study, we used interpolated climate data. These data were obtained from available climate stations; however, the density of these is relatively low in the study area and therefore these interpolated data may not necessarily reflect its exact climate, particularly in mountainous areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Remotely sensed data may be more informative than ground-based data sets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]; in our case, in spite of its limitations, we used the Worldclim dataset because it includes future projections needed for future modelling, but for new studies of the potential current distribution of these vectors, data from remote sensors may be preferable. Our projections consider climate at a regional scale, but it is well known that microrefugia are present (i.e. sites that support locally favourable climate within unfavourable regional climate), which may allow populations to persist outside their main distributions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>]. Then, it is possible our modelled distributions could be constrained and, therefore, underestimated.
