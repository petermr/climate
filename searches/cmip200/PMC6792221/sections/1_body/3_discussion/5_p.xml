<p id="Par38" class="p">The model of 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> was mainly related to mean diurnal range (Bio2), which is the mean of the monthly minimum temperature subtracted from the maximum temperature, showing a decrease in the suitability under wide thermal oscillation. Then, the model is explained mainly by temperature. The current potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> included mainly coastal areas from 8° to 27°S, characterized by the Pacific anticyclone effect that prevents most rainfall and high temperature differences [
