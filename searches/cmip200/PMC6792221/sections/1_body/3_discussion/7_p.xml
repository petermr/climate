<p id="Par40" class="p">Regarding RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, it is predicted that the temperature will increase an average of 1.0, 1.8, 2.2 and 3.7 °C, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. For Chile, the increase in temperature under a severe scenario will be modest in the coast (0.5 to 1.0 °C) but will increase towards the Andes, where it may rise up to 5 °C in north and central Chile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. It is expected that these arid and semi-arid zones (that encompass most of the potential distribution areas of these species) will show modest precipitation changes, but the south will present a significant reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. These climate modifications would promote the future expansion of the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic>. For the coastal areas used by 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic>, low thermal oscillation and scarce precipitation change are expected in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. A previous study has shown that insect species living at higher latitudes, as our study subjects, have broader thermal tolerance and live in climate cooler than their physiological optimal; therefore, climate warming may enhance their fitness performance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>]. Our results for both 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. gajardoi</italic> show an increase in all future scenarios when modelling the higher public health risk situation, and a reduction in the suitable areas when modelling the lower risk situation, so there is consistency in the approaches utilized. Transmission risk models are useful and predictive if they can anticipate the effects of climate changes on spatial risk patterns, so this detected uncertainty must be taken into account in future predictions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. In our study, we considered health risk using vector distribution modelling according to climate. To be more informative for public health risk assessments, future studies should include information on vector competence and/or infection prevalence, in case these parameters are affected by climate.
