<p id="Par37" class="p">Regarding the suitability areas shown in the model, the current potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> showed two main areas: one limited to semiarid areas from 27° to 34°S, and another from 8° to 27°S including the Atacama Desert and some areas of Peru. The first area includes most of the known distribution of this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. In the second main area, no 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> occurrences have been notified, but it is a suitable climate zone to invade according to our model. The arid diagonal of the Atacama Desert has probably prevented its colonization. Given that 
 <italic class="italic">T. infestans</italic> colonized houses in this northern area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] and considering that these two species have been detected coexisting under the same sylvatic environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], it is plausible that 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> could be currently present but undetected or could eventually invade this area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>]. In fact, our current potential distribution model for 
 <italic class="italic">M. spinolai</italic> in Chile is very similar to that recently modelled for 
 <italic class="italic">T. infestans</italic> in this country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>].
