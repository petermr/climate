  <p class="p">Local and remote Arctic amplification processes. The local and remote mechanisms represent two process loops that contribute to Arctic amplification. In the remote mechanism, changes in the non-polar circulation increase atmospheric poleward heat transport warming, moistening, and producing a cloudier Arctic, increasing longwave downward radiation. The local mechanism represents the combined surface albedo (radiative) and ice-insulation (non-radiative) feedbacks whereby a less sea ice covered Arctic stores more sunlight in the ocean in summer supporting increased surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter, which warms, moistens, and produces cloudier conditions and increases longwave downward radiation. The common influence of both the local and remote mechanisms on longwave downward radiation links the two mechanisms facilitating constructive interference and makes them challenging to separate. A line connecting warmer Arctic temperatures with non-polar circulation changes suggests a potential feedback, however the dashed line is used to indicate the current lack of consensus on the magnitude and influence of Arctic temperature changes on the mid-latitude circulation</p>
