<p class="p">Nevertheless, our results are different to what has been observed for other boreal and temperate conifers. For example, lodgepole pine, which overlaps with white spruce in the west, lacks adaptive capacity for drought conditions in northern populations of the Boreal Cordillera but shows distinct adaptations to drought in southern populations (Montwé et al.,
