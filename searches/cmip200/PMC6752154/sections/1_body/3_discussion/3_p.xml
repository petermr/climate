<p class="p">A possible explanation for this observation is that southern populations already lag behind their optimal niche due to climate warming that has occurred over the last several decades. Alternatively, adaptation to biotic factors may explain the superior growth potential of Temperate Mixedwood sources from southern Ontario. In warmer mixed forest ecosystems, competition for light from other species causes higher selection pressure for fast growth, causing individuals to allocate less resource to survival adaptations (Loehle,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), we find that population differentiation in growth and survival is related to the temperature of the provenance origin. Here, the winter temperature of the origin was correlated with survival and the growing season length was associated with growth (Figure
