<p class="p">The general expectation for widespread forest trees that occur over a wide range of environmental conditions is to find genetic population differentiation in growth and adaptive traits. Local sources are expected to have the highest fitness and often also the highest growth rates (Morgenstern, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Our data for white spruce partially conform to these expectations. Local sources from the Boreal Plains ecoregion were among the top performers. Boreal Shield and Temperate Mixedwood sources from eastern Canada slightly outperformed the local sources, but for the Temperate Mixedwood provenances, fitness appears to be compromised based on the lower survival rates. Growth measurements generally conform to comparable trials in eastern Canada that also showed populations from the southern fringe of the boreal forest have the highest growth potential, even when transferred to northern test sites (Lu et al.,
