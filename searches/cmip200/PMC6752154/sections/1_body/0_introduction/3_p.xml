<p class="p">White spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea glauca</italic> (Moench) Voss) is one of the most common and widely distributed boreal forest species in North America. The species is also commercially important and comprises roughly a quarter of the Canadian Forest Inventory (NRC, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Dendrochronological and inventory plot‐based research has identified the species as sensitive to growth reductions under warming and increased moisture deficits expected under climate change projections. Water deficits limit the range of white spruce at the southern fringe (Chhin &amp; Wang,
