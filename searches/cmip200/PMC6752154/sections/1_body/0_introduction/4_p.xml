<p class="p">To address negative impacts of climate change and associated extreme events on natural and managed forest ecosystems, several general options are available (Millar, Stephenson, &amp; Stephens, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Adaptive strategies for forest management include the protection of highly valued resources, resilience options to improve the capacity of ecosystems to recover after disturbance, and management response to facilitate the transition of ecosystems from current to new conditions. A cost‐effective climate change adaptation strategy for the forestry sector is to move seed sources to more northern and higher elevation planting sites as part of ongoing reforestation programs (Aitken &amp; Bemmels,
