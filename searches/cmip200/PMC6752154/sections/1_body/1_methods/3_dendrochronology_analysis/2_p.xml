<p class="p">Core samples were preserved in plastic straws with slices for air circulation. After air‐drying for two weeks, a total of 324 increment cores were glued in wooden cores mounts (six cores were too broken to reconstruct). Then, cores were prepared using a belt sander with progressively finer grains (400, 240, 100 grains per inch) and scanned at 6,400 DPI (Epson Perfection V800 Pro). Scans were analyzed with WinDENDRO software, version 2016a (Regent Instruments Canada Inc.).
