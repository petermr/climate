<p class="p">For dendrochronological analysis, we used a subsampling design with 33 of 43 provenances. Where the original sampling design had local clusters of samples, sometimes from near‐identical locations, we selected one provenance to arrive at a well‐distributed geographical and climatic representation of growing conditions throughout the range of the species (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Within each block of the experimental design, one tree was randomly selected per provenance (5 blocks × 33 provenances = 165 trees in total). The relatively small sample size was chosen to minimize potential injuries on these valuable genetic trials and was based on a power analysis of the number of samples needed to detect population differences in growth and drought tolerance traits. Two cores were sampled in 2017 from each individual at north and south sides of the stem with an increment borer at approximately 0.5 m stem height to capture growth data since the late 1980s while coring well above areas of growth influenced by the root collar. Ring width values from the two cores per tree were averaged prior to statistical analysis.
