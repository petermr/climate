<p class="p">Projected mean range shifts varied conspicuously among species but were consistent across different AOGCMs. Nearly half (or more) of the 1,205 species had a projected decrease in their geographic range (CCSM3 = 509 species; CSIRO = 509 species; UKMO = 628 species). For species projected to suffer a reduction in range size, unweighted mean losses were 49.6% (
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 16.2%), 49.7% (
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 16.1%), and 72.4% (
