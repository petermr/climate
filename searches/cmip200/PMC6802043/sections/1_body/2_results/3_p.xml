<p class="p">Another ca. 50% of species neither decreased nor increased their projected geographic range size (CCSM3 = 663 species; CSIRO = 668 species; UKMO = 547 species). Only a small fraction of species was projected to increase its geographic range size (CCSM3 = 33 species; CSIRO = 28 species; UKMO = 30 species), with mean increase of 344.8% (
