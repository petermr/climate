<p class="p">The search for correlates of range shifts under contemporary climate change has been an active research line in ecology (e.g., MacLean &amp; Beissinger, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Williams &amp; Blois, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The method we used to decompose the variation in range shifts among species also allowed us to infer that phylogenetic relatedness is a poor predictor of range shifts (but see Comte, Murienne, &amp; Grenouillet, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref> for a contrasting result with stream fishes). We found that bird species with larger clutch size are expected to lose a smaller range of occurrence than species with smaller clutch size. This pattern was consistent across all AOGCM and with studies showing that species with higher fecundity may be buffered against a decrease in their overall range of occurrence (e.g., Amano &amp; Yamamura, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Bird species with higher threat of extinction (higher IUCN categories of extinction risk values) may lose a larger range of occurrence projected for CGCM and CSIRO. For UKMO, these species were projected to lose a smaller range of occurrence than species classified with a smaller extinction risk. Altitudinal midpoint correlated positively with differences in range of occurrence. However, studies have shown that mountain bird species will lose a greater range of occurrence than other species (e.g., La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Freeman, Scholer, Ruiz‐Gutierez, &amp; Fitzpatrick, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; see also a meta‐analysis by Scridel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). A possible reason for the difference between our results and those from other studies is that our dataset included only 30 species (2.5% from all bird species we considered) with distributions restricted to high altitudes (following the classification proposed by Stotz, Fitzpatrick, Parker, &amp; Moskovits, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>; e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Accipter striatus</italic> Vieillot, 1808, 
 <italic class="italic">Microcerculus ustulatus</italic> Salvin &amp; Godman, 1883, 
 <italic class="italic">Roraimia adusta</italic> (Salvin &amp; Godman, 1884), and 
 <italic class="italic">Trogon personatus</italic> Gould, 1842). This unbalance toward species with larger range size and not restricted to high altitudes may be the reason for the positive relationship between midpoint of altitude and difference in potential geographic distribution. Therefore, this result should be interpreted with caution, also considering that it was detected under UKMO only. In general, our results suggest that the choice of AOGCMs is also an important aspect to be considered in studies searching for correlates of range shift.
