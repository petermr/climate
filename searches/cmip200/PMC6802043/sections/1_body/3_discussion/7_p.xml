<p class="p">Finally, had we assumed dispersal limitation in our ENMs, our estimates of range shift would be even greater (depicting a more pessimistic scenario) because dispersal limitation would make it difficult for species to track their optimal conditions in space (Hof &amp; Allen,

 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). One could also argue that our estimates of potential geographic range loss would be lower after allowing for adaptation. However, recent studies indicate that the effect of adaptation (evolutionary rescue) may be limited (Cotto et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). Valladares et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) showed that the forecasted effects of climate change on species range shifts are expected to even increase when phenotypic plasticity is incorporated into ENMs. Our estimates of variation in range shifts are likely to be conservative because a recent study by Thuiller et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>) showed that ENMs differ greatly in predicting future distributions even when only ENMs with high predictive accuracies are considered in the analyses.
