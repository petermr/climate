<p class="p">Despite the uncertainties associated with ENMs, which were considered in the meta‐analytic approach implemented here, our results suggest that the effects of human‐induced global warming on the geographic distributions of Neotropical birds are concerning. We believe that a promising line of investigation would consist in finding other species traits with high capability to predict likely ranges shifts (as forecasted by ENMs). For instance, an additional bird trait not considered here is the extent of breeding seasons. In a recent meta‐analysis, Halupka and Halupka (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), for example, found that climate change may extend breeding seasons for multi‐brooded species and reduce it for single‐breeding species from the northern hemisphere. Species reproducing for a longer period may increase their population size and consequently the range that this species occurs. Finding strong correlates of range shift would help policymakers to focus not only where the effects of climate changes are likely to be stronger (e.g., Jetz et al.,
