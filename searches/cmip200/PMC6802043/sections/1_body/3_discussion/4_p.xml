<p class="p">However, an important message of our study is that we should not attribute the same weight for different species when assessing cross‐species differences in potential distributions. This is so because, in the context of ensemble forecasting (Araújo &amp; New, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), different ENMs provide different forecasts of potential distribution for the same species (e.g., Buisson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Diniz‐Filho et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Garcia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lawler et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Our results considered these differences because we down‐weighted species with variable range shifts estimates due to the use of different ENMs. The reason behind weighting is that species with low uncertainties in terms of range shifts will give estimates of the effects of climate change on geographic ranges that are more robust to the choices of ENMs. Also, weighting the estimates of range shift accordingly will likely increase the likelihood of correctly estimating the potential effects of climate changes. If we did not weight the

  <sub class="sub">i</sub>
 </italic> values, we would observe a mean difference in potential distribution of 6.38% (95% CI = ±12.44%), 6.28% (±12.49%) and −4.63% (±16.88%) under CCSM3, CSIRO, and UKMO projections, respectively. Thus, without taking uncertainty into account, our estimates of the effect of climate change on geographic range size would be much smaller and, probably, downward biased. In general, we believe that taking uncertainty into account, while estimating the effects of climate change on species distributions, will be an important step in rebutting climate change denialism (e.g., Boussalis &amp; Coan,
