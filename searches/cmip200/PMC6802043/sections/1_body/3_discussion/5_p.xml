<p class="p">Our meta‐analytic approach provides an alternative method to quantify the relative variation in estimates of range shifts within (i.e., due to the use of different ENMs and AOGCMs) and among species. Our results are in line with those reported previously by showing that a substantial part of the variation in range shifts (from 25.7% up to 34.1%) can be attributed to the use of different ENMs (for a recent study, see Thuiller et al.,

However, our findings also highlight that most of the variation in range shifts, for a given AOGCM, can be attributable to real differences between species and that a small part of this variation is phylogenetically structured (except under UKMO). Taken together, our results suggest that the main question (or source of uncertainty) is not whether many Neotropical bird species will lose a large proportion of their climatic space (as it has also been projected for northern‐boreal land bird; see Virkkala, Heikkinen, Leikola, &amp; Luoto, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), but “which species will be under most threat” (Sinclair, White, &amp; Newell,
