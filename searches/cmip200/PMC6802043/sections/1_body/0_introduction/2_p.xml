<p class="p">Evidence supporting human‐induced global warming and its effects on biological processes and biodiversity patterns are accumulating conspicuously (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Pecl et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This evidence comes from multiple sources, including studies on phenology (e.g., time of leaf unfolding events), shifts in the border of species' geographic ranges (Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) and those based on controlled experiments (Walker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Empirical evidence of the effects of global warming on biodiversity is so overwhelming that the number of synthesis of these impacts is increasing steadily (e.g., Ainsworth, Rosenberg, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref> and references therein; Halupka &amp; Halupka,
