<p class="p">Our analyses were divided in three steps. First, for each species, we fitted eight ENMs (assuming unlimited dispersal): BIOCLIM, Euclidean distance, Random Forest, Generalized Additive Model, Generalized Linear Model, Gower distance, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Maxent (see Rangel &amp; Loyola, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Using these models, we estimated the potential geographic distributions for baseline and future climates, considering three AOGCM (CCSM3, CSIRO‐Mk3.0 (CSIRO), and UKMO‐HadCM3 (UKMO); see Diniz‐Filho et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref> for details), for the scenario A1 (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). In sum, for each species, we generated 24 values of potential geographic range size (eight ENMs projected into three AOGCMs), both for baseline and future climates (generating a total of 48 projections). The eight ENMs listed above were originally selected by Diniz‐Filho et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) to study the variation in the results derived from the use of different modeling strategies, from simple (e.g., BLIOCLIM) to more computer‐intensive methods (Random Forest). Because a key aspect of our approach also consists in measuring the variation in range shift and, for comparative purposes, we use the same ENMs.
