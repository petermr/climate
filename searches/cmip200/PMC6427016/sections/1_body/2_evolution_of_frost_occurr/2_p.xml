<p id="Par7" class="p">The present altitudinal range of frost occurrence will show major changes during the 21st century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Main changes occur between 2000 and 4000 m asl for RCP2.6 in the morning (Tn), and between 3000 and 4500 m in the afternoon (Tx), according to RCP2.6 downscaled simulations. They are much higher in elevation and magnitude for RCP8.5 (up to −45–50 pp between 3500 and 4000 m asl for Tn and −30 to −50 pp at the same elevation for Tx by the late century).
