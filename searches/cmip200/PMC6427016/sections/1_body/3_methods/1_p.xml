<p id="Par9" class="p">A frost event is defined as a day for which Tn &lt; 0 °C for morning frost, or Tx &lt; 0 °C for afternoon (permanent) frost. Frost frequency (in %) is obtained as the ratio between the number of frost events and the total length of the period. Frost evolutions under climate change consist in differences between future and current frost frequencies and are thus expressed as percentage points (pp). The statistical downscaling

 </sup>, as used here, combines temporal variability derived from CMIP5 simulations, and spatial variability based on statistical relationships obtained on observed time series (an original database of 60 weather stations available daily over a 35-year period). Temperature biases are inherited from both the CMIP5 model and the statistical downscaling: see Supplementary Information and methodological paper
