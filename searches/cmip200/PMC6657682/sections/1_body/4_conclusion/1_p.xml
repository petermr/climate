<p class="p">We documented 2,354 narrowly distributed species of seed plants in 776 areas that altogether cover 17.5% of Brazil. From 70% to 85% of these species are projected to face high extinction risk due to habitat loss and/or climate change. The importance of climate change and habitat loss as drivers of species extinction varies across domains, and this variation demands the adoption of retrospective and prospective conservation strategies. At the national level, we suggest that the integration and coherence of biodiversity conservation and climate change policies is a critical step to safeguard an irreplaceable portion of Brazilian biodiversity.</p>
