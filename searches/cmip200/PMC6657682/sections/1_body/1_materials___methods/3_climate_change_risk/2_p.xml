<p class="p">The RCCI uses monthly precipitation and surface air temperature data, simulated for the present-day climate (1961–1990) and projected to the end of this century (2071–2100). It combines the same 21 Earth System Models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) (

These models were forced into two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP trajectories) in the year 2100 relative to preindustrial conditions: 4.5 W/m

Because of the low resolution, we used the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset, which is a set of downscaled climate scenarios derived from the CMIP5 with two of the four RCPs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The NEX-GDDP dataset allows studies of climate change impacts at local to regional scales (
