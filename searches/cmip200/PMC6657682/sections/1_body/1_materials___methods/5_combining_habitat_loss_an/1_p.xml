<p class="p">We created a matrix that combines the categories of climate change and habitat loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) and classified areas with microendemics into four risk classes: (1) areas with low risk (with low or medium climate change risk and low or medium habitat loss), (2) areas threatened by habitat loss (with high habitat loss and low or medium climate change risk), (3) areas threatened by climate change (with high climate change risk and low or medium habitat loss), and (4) areas threatened by climate change and habitat loss (with high climate change risk and high habitat loss). For each land-use scenario, we counted the number of areas and species in each risk class.
