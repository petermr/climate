<p class="p">The adoption of retrospective and prospective conservation strategies demands governance mechanisms that integrate conservation and national climate change strategies into a coherent policy framework. However, despite all the global efforts to promote policy coherence and integration, the policies regarding biodiversity conservation and climate change at the national scale continue to be drifting apart. We suggest that in tropical countries such as Brazil, where resources are scarce and sound environmental governance continues to be an issue, integrating biodiversity conservation and climate change policies (both mitigation and adaptation) is the most effective solution to achieve win-win social and environmental solutions while halting species extinction.</p>
