 </sup> (hereafter NM14), projected the effects of SLR on future flood return levels. Our findings on the effects of SLR on flood return levels are comparable with those from the USACE study. We project, for example, that SLR causes an increase of 1.38 m in the 100-year flood level at the New York county from the historical period of 1980–2005 to the future period of 2070–2095 under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Projections from NM14 for the New York City (The Battery NY) indicate that SLR causes an increase of 0.8 m in the 100-year flood level from 2014 to 2114 under the modified NRC-III rate SLR scenario and an increase of 1.29 m under the modified NRC-III rate (USACE High) SLR scenario. However, our study advances the USACE study in several ways. First, NM14 presented the flood levels at the location of 23 tide gauge stations in the Northeastern US whereas we presented the spatially continuous distribution of flood levels along the entire US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Second, while NM14 considered deterministic SLR projections, our study accounted for probabilistic SLR projections. Third, NM14 assessed only the effects of SLR on flood levels while we evaluated effects of both SLR and TC climatology change.
