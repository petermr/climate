<p id="Par22" class="p">The basin-scale approach adopted in this study allowed us to evaluate the spatial variation of flood return levels at the county level. Regional-scale (and local-scale) studies and flood mapping require a more detailed variation of flood levels along the coastlines to support regional flood mitigation strategies. Basin-scale studies reveal whether a regional-scale study is essential for a specific region (and how urgent it is), prioritizing regional-scale flood hazard and mitigation studies. Regional scale studies cover a smaller area and thus can have a higher resolution than basin-scale studies. Such studies may also account for elements that are usually missing in larger scale studies such as inundation over coastal floodplains (see further discussion in “Methods” section). Thus, regional-scale studies may be informed by the basin-scale studies, and the results of regional-scale studies in turn may be used to evaluate the accuracy of basin-scale studies. Another benefit of a basin-scale flood hazard study such as presented here is that it reveals regions where SLR, storm climatology change, or both play a role in future changes in flood hazards. Regional-scale studies for regions where the storm climatology change does not impact future flood hazards (e.g. 100-year flood level in Gulf of Maine) may focus on the effect of SLR, while regional-scale studies for Gulf of Mexico should consider the compound effects of SLR and storm climatology change.</p>
