 </sup>. The projections consider ice sheet components (the Greenland, West Antarctic, and the East Antarctic ice sheets); glacier and ice cap surface mass balance; global mean thermal expansion and regional ocean steric and ocean dynamic effects; land water storage; and long term, local, nonclimatic sea level change due to factors such as glacial isostatic adjustment and subsidence. The database provides projections of the probability distribution function (PDF) of SLR at tide gauge stations around the world, under various emission scenarios. In this study, we apply the projection under RCP 8.5 emission scenario for tidal gauges located along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.
