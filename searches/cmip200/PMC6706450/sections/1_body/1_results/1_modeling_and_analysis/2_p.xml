 </sup> (see “Methods” section). For each coastal county, we use the projection under RCP 8.5 of the end-of-21st century SLR from the closest station to that county. Combining the probabilistic projections of storm tide and SLR, we perform statistical analysis to estimate the return periods of flood heights (see “Methods” section). Considering that climate model projections may be biased, we bias correct the climate model-projected storm tides based on a comparison of the model estimates for the historical period with the NCEP-based estimates (see “Methods” section). We also obtain a weighted average projection of storm tides with the weight on each climate model depending on its accuracy in the historical estimations relative to the NCEP estimations (see “Methods” section). The flood return level estimations are performed for each coastal county along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (Fig.
