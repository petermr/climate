<p id="Par17" class="p">This study was based on monthly-mean data from reanalysis projects and the suite of CMIP5 climate models, and only the NH was considered. Owing to the different resolutions of the models and reanalysis data, a bilinear interpolation was used to convert the reanalysis and model datasets to a common resolution of 1° × 1° (latitude × longitude). Monthly precipitation data from the GPCC Full Data Product Version 4, monthly air temperature from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset and monthly soil moisture to a depth of 10 cm from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Version 1 were used to estimate permafrost distribution under the present-day climate.</p>
