We refer to the definition provided by Assessment Report 5 published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5), which designates 1986 to 2005 as a reference period under the current climate

 </sup>. The future simulations used included three different RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), ranging from 2006 to 2100. The model variables include surface temperature, air temperature and precipitation, and the output from run1 of each model was used (e.g. r1i1p1).
