<p class="p">There is no unique definition of CF return periods, with none of them being a priori superior. Each definition provides different information, and one should be chosen on the basis of the context and aim of the study (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">37</italic>
 </xref>). Here, the AND return period is chosen, which measures the probability of both individual hazards, sea level and precipitation, exceeding a chosen threshold. This definition allows for disentangling and understanding the dynamics of the potential flooding caused only by the concurrence of high sea level and precipitation values (1-year return levels). Specifically, we defined the bivariate CF return periods (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">26</italic>
 </xref>) as the mean waiting time between events where sea level and precipitation simultaneously exceed the individual 1-year return levels (i.e., the ~99.7th percentiles 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub class="sub">99.7</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">99.7</sub>). To allow for a robust estimation, we applied a parametric copula-based bivariate probability distribution. Applying a parametric model for the full range of values, one would run the risk of biasing the representation of the extreme tail by the bulk of the bivariate distribution where most data occur. Therefore, we applied the model only to pairs of high values. We selected pairs where, simultaneously, sea level and precipitation values exceed the individual 95th percentiles (
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sel</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sel</sub>, respectively). In a very few locations, one might end up with selecting few pairs only. Here, we reduced the selection threshold 0.95 to ensure that at least 20 pairs of values were selected (never below 0.9). Clusters of selected event pairs separated by less than 3 days were replaced by a unique event, which assumed the maximum sea level 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic> and precipitation 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> observed in the cluster (fig. S9).
