<p class="p">Several studies have demonstrated the importance and damaging nature of CF for selected locations (

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>) presented the first assessment of the dependence between observed high sea levels and high river discharge for estuaries around the globe, although the sparse observations precluded the assessment in several regions. Comprehensive studies exist for the United Kingdom (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>), Australia (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>), and the coastal areas of the United States (U.S.) (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). The U.S. study detected an increasing probability of CF during the past decades, although it was not possible to attribute this increase to anthropogenic climate change. However, given that extreme precipitation (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>), river flooding (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>), and extreme sea levels (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">17</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>) are expected to increase under future climate change, it is likely that also the CF probability will increase along with these driving processes. Furthermore, coastal cities are expected to further grow in the coming decades (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>), and more and more people will be exposed to CF, rendering an analysis of CF in the future urgent. So far, only the effect of mean sea level rise (SLR) on the changing CF hazard has been analyzed and only for selected locations in the U.S. (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>). The future CF probability, taking into account future changes of precipitation, storm surges, waves, and astronomical tides, has not yet been assessed.
