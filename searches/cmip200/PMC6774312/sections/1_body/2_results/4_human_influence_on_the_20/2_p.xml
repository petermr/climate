<p class="p">The intense warming over the last decades has strongly shifted the odds of experiencing a GCWH18‐like event, and we determine the human influence on a GCWH18‐like area. A 2018‐like event with an average 22% concurrent hot day area between May and July is not uncommon in climate simulations of a present‐day climate with anthropogenic forcing (

Hence, the analysis based on the 1958–1988 reference period suggests that average concurrent hot day areas that exceed 20% of the NH AgPop area could not have occurred without human‐induced climate change. For the reference period, the observed probabilities of exceeding specific average concurrent hot day areas fall within the model range, which provides confidence in the model simulations of concurrent hot day areas with large extent (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). However, this reference period is relatively short and already includes a mean warming signal of about 0.3 °C compared to the preindustrial period 1870 to 1900. During that period, the occurrence of a 2018‐like heat event occurs in 2 years in one out of 29 models (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). Hence, considering all model simulations, this results in an approximately 0.2% probability for a GCWH18‐like area to have occurred under preindustrial conditions. These findings confirm that it is
