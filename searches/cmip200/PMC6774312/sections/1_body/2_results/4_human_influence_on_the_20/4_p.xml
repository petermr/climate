<p class="p">In a +1.5 and +2 °C world, the probability of experiencing a heat wave with at least the size of the GCWH18 event increases to 65% (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b) and 97% (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>c) in the multimodel median, respectively. This implies that even if global warming is limited to +1.5 °C, we would experience a GCWH18‐type event on average nearly 2 out of 3 years and nearly every year at +2 °C warming.
