 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>). The contiguous United States had the warmest May since 1895 (NOAA,

 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018a</xref>). The 2018 hot temperatures are in line with an increase in intensity and frequency of extreme heat events over many regions on land and in the ocean in recent years (Coumou &amp; Rahmstorf,

Owing to their devastating impacts, understanding changes in extreme temperature events is highly relevant for society and ecosystems. Recent heat waves with particularly severe impacts include the 2010 Russian and 2015 Indian heat waves. The 2010 Russian heat wave was associated with the death of tens of thousands of people, major crop failure, millions of hectares affected by fires, and around 15 billion U.S. dollar economic loss (Barriopedro et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). During the 2015 heat wave in India, at least 2,500 people died (Ratnam et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Impacts were particularly severe because they occurred in agricultural regions and/or regions with high population density.
