<p class="p">In the future, the intensity, frequency, and global heat wave area over land are projected to drastically increase (Coumou &amp; Robinson, 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Christidis et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). These projected increases can strongly affect future heat wave impacts and risk of concurrent extremes. While locally confined climate extremes often lead to devastating impacts at the local scale, spatially correlated extremes can have much more severe societal impacts due to their effect on integrated variables. For instance, concurrent heat waves in different agricultural regions can affect global food production (Sarhadi et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) and consequently increase global food prizes and food insecurity (Tigchelaar et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Similarly, synchronized river floods can cause excessive damages (Berghuijs et al.,
