<p class="p">Heat waves will likely reach highly dangerous levels for ecosystems and societies over the coming decades. However, if other factors that contribute to such impacts change as well, assessing environmental risks associated with heat waves becomes much more complex. For instance, the impact of expanding concurrent hot day areas is often aggravated by population increases. In the United States, population exposure to extreme heat has increased fourfold to sixfold in the late twentieth century due to a combined increase in temperatures and population growth (Jones et al.,
