In particular, many researchers focused on the impacts of climate change require large collections of ESM runs to rigorously study the impacts to both human and natural systems of low-frequency high-importance events, such as multi-year droughts. Climate model emulators provide an effective mechanism for filling this gap, reproducing many aspects of ESMs rapidly but with lower precision. The <monospace>fldgen v1.0</monospace> R package quickly generates thousands of realizations of gridded temperature fields by randomizing the residuals of pattern scaling temperature output from any single ESM, retaining the spatial and temporal variance and covariance structures of the input data at a low computational cost. The <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> R package described here extends this capability to produce joint realizations of multiple variables, with a focus on temperature and precipitation in an open source software package available for community use (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen">https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen</ext-link>). This substantially improves the <monospace>fldgen</monospace> package by removing the requirement that the ESM variables be normally distributed, and will enable researchers to quickly generate covarying temperature and precipitation data that are synthetic but faithful to the characteristics of the original ESM.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Primary funding was provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory through the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program (supported AS, RL, KD, BK, BBL, CH).

Understanding the uncertainty around extreme events also has direct relevance for decision makers, the U.S. energy grid, and other stakeholders. Generally, high-resolution future climate scenarios can be used as input for different process-based or economic models to assess impacts of future climate on economic, land, energy, and other systems; however, thousands of such high-resolution future scenarios may be needed for a full and robust analysis of the impacts of low-frequency high-importance extreme events and associated uncertainties [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Process-rich Earth System Models (ESMs) are capable of providing the high-resolution future climate scenarios for impacts studies, but are too computationally expensive to directly produce hundreds or thousands of realizations needed to understand the impacts of extreme events. Climate model emulators attempt to solve this problem by approximating the output a climate model would have produced had it been run repeatedly for a specified scenario [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These emulators are computationally cheap to run, but typically capture only the mean response of the climate and little to none of the variability that would be present in a real ESM output. Attempts to add variability to such emulations often lose important spatial and temporal correlations that fundamentally define ESM patterns (such as the El Ni&#x000f1;o Southern Oscillation), or else cannot produce the number of realizations necessary for extreme event or uncertainty studies.</p><p>In <monospace>fldgen v1.0</monospace>, Link et al. [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (Paper LS1 hereafter) have solved many of these problems for the case of global temperature. This method generates random realizations of temperature global gridded time series that retain the spatial and temporal variance and covariance structures of the input ESM data at a much lower computational cost compared to the ESMs being emulated. Crucially, <monospace>fldgen v1.0</monospace> does so without placing <italic>a priori</italic> limits on the form of the correlation function and without using bootstrap resampling of existing ESM output [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, temperature is not the only important variable for quantifying the effects of future climate on human systems. Precipitation, for example, is of interest because of the serious impacts of extreme precipitation events, as the distribution of precipitation over space and time is a primary driver of extreme events like droughts and floods [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, the water cycle is a key component of research focused on water cycle impact on agriculture and water consumption in energy production [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Recent research has shown that modeling temperature and precipitation extremes independently mischaracterizes drought hazards as the covariance between climate variables is missed [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, an effective emulator of temperature and precipitation must jointly produce temperature and precipitation realizations that capture such covariance. <monospace>Fldgen v2.0</monospace> is designed to add this capability, allowing researchers to jointly generate two-variable (e.g. joint temperature and precipitation) fields that not only retain the individual variables&#x02019; spatial and temporal variance and covariance structures, but also inter-variable covariance. This method is meant to be used on annual, global gridded temperature and precipitation data. While many interesting climatological and biological processes occur at daily or monthly scales, this annual timescale is often used by researchers in the impacts community focused on long-term effects. Many of these researchers also require global gridded realizations of ESM variables [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223542.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is true that past modeling approaches such as the UKCP09 framework have provided a methodology for stochastically generating daily weather data for specific regions that does to some degree account for correlations between multiple variables and has accurate statistical structure to high order [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, because the focus of that method is on weather in specific regions, it does not necessarily incorporate dynamics that govern larger spatiotemporal scales to be usable in a global gridded manner.</p><p>
<monospace>Fldgen v2.0</monospace> provides a tool for modelers to rigorously analyze the impacts of extreme events that previously could not be fully evaluated due to limited ESM realizations and region-to-region teleconnections that are not explicitly known globally, such as multi-year droughts across different regions. The objective of this paper is to describe the open-source and publicly available <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> R package work-flow, capabilities, and accessibility for community use (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen">https://github.com/jgcri/fldgen</ext-link>) in the context of joint generation of temperature and precipitation fields. This includes an overview of the updates to the <monospace>fldgen</monospace> algorithm from version 1.0 to version 2.0. The theory that supports this extension should be applicable to arbitrary pairs of ESM variables, though this has not been tested and is not a central claim of this work.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Extension from version 1.0 to 2.0 and architecture</title><p>The scientific details of generating new realizations of residuals from a training matrix of ESM residuals are detailed in the <monospace>fldgen v1.0</monospace> model description Paper LS1. One key feature of the version 1.0 process is that the generated time series of temperature residuals in any given grid cell is approximately normally distributed. This is true irrespective of the distributions of input residuals, due to the way the algorithm sums up contributions from a large number of random components. As a result, the method will preserve the distribution of input residuals only if they are normally distributed.</p><p>When the training data features normally distributed residuals in every grid cell, the field generating process generates new realizations of time series that preserves three key statistical properties of the training residuals (arrow 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001">Fig 1</xref>, Paper LS1):</p><list list-type="order"><title>Statistical properties of training residuals preserved by version 1.0</title><list-item><p>Distribution of values in a grid cell over time and between realizations.

However, residuals for other variables, such as precipitation, in many grid cells may have a non-normal distribution (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Thus, in addition to the joint emulation of variables such as temperature and precipitation, one major goal of <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> is to make the field generation process more robust to non-normally distributed ESM variables. Even in cases where distributions are reasonably well approximated by normal distributions, this change removes the need for a user&#x02019;s expert judgement as to whether an ESM variable&#x02019;s residuals in each grid cell follow a distribution sufficiently close to normal to use the field generating method.</p><fig id="pone.0223542.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0223542.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of empirical CDF from precipitation data with normal distribution.</title><p>The empirical CDF of precipitation residuals in a single grid cell (black) and the CDF of a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as the precipitation residuals (red).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0223542.g002"/></fig><p>For the core field generating method, each ESM variable must effectively be able to accept residuals of between &#x02212;&#x0221e; and &#x0221e; for addition to its mean field. This is already the case for temperature and no transformation is needed. However, because precipitation values in an ESM cannot be negative, either the generated residuals have to be constrained to avoid negative precipitation while preserving the ESM spatiotemporal and intervariable statistics, or the method must operate on a transformation of precipitation that can accept residuals between &#x02212;&#x0221e; and &#x0221e;. The latter is more straightforward, and so residuals are generated for log(precipitation) rather than precipitation. The transformation of generated full fields from log(precipitation) space back to precipitation space is trivial for log transformations. Indeed, any function that is continuous, invertible, strictly increasing, and results in a transformed ESM variable whose residuals are supported on (&#x02212;&#x0221e;, &#x0221e;) will preserve the ESM spatiotemporal statistical properties as desired.</p><p>Producing joint temperature and log(precipitation) residual realizations therefore requires the development of an algorithm to handle non-normality in transformed ESM training data. This algorithm extension for <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> involves additional transformations on the input to and output from the version 1.0 process (<xref rid="pone.0223542.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001">Fig 1</xref>) in order to return generated realizations of joint temperature and log(precipitation) residuals to the native temperature and log(precipitation) distribution in each grid cell. One additional benefit is that this extension removes an assumption necessary to use version 1.0: we previously were restricted to assuming temperature residuals followed a normal distribution in each grid cell.

<monospace>Fldgen v2.0</monospace> provides a tool for climate change impacts modelers to rigorously analyze the impacts of extreme events that previously could not be fully evaluated due to limited ESM realizations and region-to-region teleconnections that are not explicitly known globally, such as multi-year droughts across different regions. With the mathematical construction described in the previous section and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g003">Fig 3</xref> (right), when the full workflow depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223542.g001">Fig 1</xref> is completed, the algorithm can be run on any input ESM residuals, provided their distribution in each grid cell is continuous and invertible. An emulator trained on these residuals can be used to generate new ESM residual time series that preserve all the same statistical properties preserved by version 1, with one small exception, viz. that in Property 2 the type of correlation preserved is the rank-order correlation, not necessarily the linear correlation coefficient. This change is a consequence of allowing arbitrary native distributions in the data. Additionally, the residual fields generated this way also preserve the inter-variable correlations present in the input data, a new property with no analog in version 1.</p><p>These generated residual time series are added to the mean fields for temperature and log(precipitation) to generate new full field time series. The transformation of the full field log(precipitation) time series values to precipitation values does not undo any of these statistical properties of the residual fields.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Validation: Example data and automated testing</title><p>Extensive integrated, automatic testing is provided in the <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> R package to both check that the software performs as intended and to explicitly validate that the statistical properties of interest for included example ESM data (<monospace>fldgen/inst/extdata</monospace>) are indeed preserved in generated realizations. This explicit validation supplements mathematical proofs that the method being implemented in <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> has the described statistical preservation properties (further described and verified in Paper LS1).</p><p>The testing is automatically run when a Pull Request is opened in the <monospace>fldgen</monospace> GitHub repository and must be passed before the pull request can be merged. All checks were passed for the version of <monospace>fldgen</monospace> presented in this paper.</p><p>While it mathematically follows from the construction of this method that the rank-correlation coefficient is the same in generated data as it was in the training ESM data for every pairwise possibility of grid cell to grid cell comparison of temperature with temperature, precipitation with precipitation, and temperature with precipitation, we also performed an explicit check of of this using <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> emulator training and realization generating capabilities. This explicit test is not included in the automated testing suite as it takes many hours of computer time.

Through this algorithm, any variable that scales with global mean temperature and whose residuals in each grid cell have a continuous, invertible, increasing empirical CDF could be jointly explored with temperature. Certainly this includes precipitation, but could easily be applied, as is, to variables such as relative humidity. Further, the version 1.0 requirement that input training data have approximately normally distributed residuals for the method to generate new residual fields with the correct spatiotemporal and cross-variable statistics has been removed. A user no longer has to judge whether their input training data is sufficiently close to normal to use <monospace>fldgen</monospace>.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant current limitation of <monospace>fldgen</monospace> is that its training data and thus outputs are limited to the annual time scale, while many interesting climatological and biological processes occur at daily or monthly scales&#x02014;e.g. with respect to human health [<xref rid="pone.0223542.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An expansion to sub-annual timescales is planned in future work, but appropriately capturing sub-annual ESM internal variability while accounting for the inherent seasonal signals in sub-annual ESM data for many variables is highly non-trivial.</p><p>A future extension to handle more than two variables jointly would also be straightforward by design. Thus there is wide potential for reuse of <monospace>fldgen v2.0</monospace> for users of ESM outputs who require a large number of ESM datasets for research.
