<p class="p">We have presented one formulation of this transition time, and we also explore some alternative definitions that produce similar results (SI). Even in a scenario such as RCP 4.5, where emissions are rapidly reduced by mid‐21st century, there are substantial spatial differences in the time it takes to reach a rate of steady warming. This transition time occurs latest in the Arctic and low latitudes; as low latitudes have been characterized as having the earliest ToE (Hawkins &amp; Sutton,

While the ToE and TSC bookend this second stage of high transience, it is important to note that TSC need not imply climate stabilization. For example, amplified warming in high latitudes is expected in the 23rd century at rates that are multiple times higher than the global average of 0.02
