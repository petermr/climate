<p class="p">Of the emission scenarios considered in this analysis, higher emission scenarios coincide with later global TSC values. This could be a result of higher GHG requiring more time to reach an equilibrium warming rate or could be due to the different transition times between peak emissions and constant (or near constant) GHG. For example, a more abrupt change point from increasing to constant forcing could lead to a delayed transition between the fast and slow climate responses following GHG stabilization (Held et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Changes in ocean circulation provide a possible explanation of this transition time between the fast and slow response of warming (Rugenstein et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Stouffer, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Abrupt increases in forcing lead to faster relative warming of the ocean surface, increasing stability, and temporary weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This, in turn, leads to temporary increases in Arctic ice formation, which delays the onset of the slow increase in warming. Further experimental analysis would be required to probe the mechanisms leading to the different TSC time scales across emission scenarios.
