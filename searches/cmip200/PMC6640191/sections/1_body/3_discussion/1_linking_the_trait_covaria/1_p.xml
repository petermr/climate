<p class="p">Our simulations focused on trait variations (especially trait covariations) and vegetation distributions. We first predicted the trait covariations based on the trait–climate corresponding relationships and then classified the trait combinations into different vegetation types. This method had been validated by several studies (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), and it has been improved in two aspects: one was that trait covariations were used in this study to provide more information about plant strategies, e.g., tundra vegetation simultaneously had the highest

Previous studies have focused on vegetation sensitivity under future climate scenarios and our results showed high consistency with these former studies (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang et al., 2016</xref>); for example, both tropical forests and subtropical forests shifted to the north under the scenarios in which temperature increased, and the area of the boreal forest and tundra decreased. Although the vegetation distributions and PFTs were not necessary in the process of ecological models, they were still important outputs of the vegetation dynamic model.
