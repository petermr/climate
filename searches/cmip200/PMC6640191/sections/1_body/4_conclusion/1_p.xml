<p class="p">In conclusion, trait-based vegetation modeling provides a promising route toward ecosystem and land-surface models that are “reliable, robust, and realistic” (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prentice et al., 2015</xref>), and it can tackle a wider range of scientific questions than current models. Field measurements of key traits are valuable in providing information for trait-based model development, although despite the availability of large plant-trait data compilations (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kattge et al., 2011</xref>), the number of sites that include all of any specified set of plant traits is often disappointingly small because different groups typically collect data on different sets of traits. A limited amount of comparative work has been performed, such as on photosynthetic traits that are particularly important for vegetation modeling. Moreover, there remains a need for more extensive and co-located collections and analyses of plant functional traits (notably, stem hydraulic properties), which may be equally important for functional ecology and vegetation modeling.
