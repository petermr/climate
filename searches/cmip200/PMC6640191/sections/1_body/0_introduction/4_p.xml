<p class="p">In this paper, we examined a suite of leaf traits using co-located measurements and quantified the contributions of climate to predict the vegetation distribution in China. Our analysis was based on an extensive data set (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We focused on three leaf traits, i.e., leaf area index (LAI), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf nitrogen per unit area (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). We performed multivariate analysis to quantify the co-located trait–climate relationships; then, we trained a GMM with corresponding trait–vegetation relationships; and finally, we examined the response of vegetation to a changing climate. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the trait covariations resulting from climate, (2) investigate the relationships between vegetation types and trait covariations, and (3) predict the distribution and response of vegetation to changing climatic conditions.
