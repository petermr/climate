<p class="p">The three RCPs differed greatly in temperature, which was highest in RCP8.5, especially after 2050, followed by that in RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2A</xref>). The variations in temperature increased considerably before 2050. After 2050, the temperature in RCP8.5 showed a continuous increasing trend. The temperature in RCP2.6 was relatively stable after 2050, and the temperatures in RCP4.5 remain intermediate between those in RCP2.6 and RCP 8.5. Among the three climate models, NorESM1-M had the highest temperature values under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, followed by IPSL-CM5A-MR and MPI-ESM-MR; however, the temperature in IPSL-CM5A-MR was higher than that in the two other models under RCP8.5.
