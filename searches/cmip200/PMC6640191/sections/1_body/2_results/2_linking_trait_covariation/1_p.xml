<p class="p">The three climatic variables explained 65% of the trait variation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) described the patterns of trait variation with climate, and showed the between-site patterns of trait covariation imposed by climatic gradients. The first RDA axis was overwhelmingly dominant and related to the gradient of PR from steppe to moist forests. The LAI varied along this gradient, with large leaves characteristic of wetter environments. The second RDA axis accounted for 2% of trait variation and was related to the covariation of the mean growing-season temperature and daily temperature along the latitudinal gradient from the boreal zone to the tropics. Trait variation on this axis resembled that of the LES: warmer, high-irradiance climates were characterized by plants with lower SLA and higher
