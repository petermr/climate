<p class="p">For the GMM-based discriminant analysis, the distribution of vegetation derived from a natural vegetation map, together with the predicted historical trait patterns, were used to train the GMM classifier. Once the GMM density function was confirmed, the probability layers of each vegetation type were obtained according to the Gaussian density functions. The SLA-

 <sub class="sub">area</sub>-LAI combination had a high accuracy in predicting vegetation distributions, and its overall accuracy was 75.14% and kappa coefficient was 69.27%. Desert and water (no vegetation region) were masked in this study. The optimal classification by the GMM and its comparison with a natural vegetation map are shown in
