  <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span> shows a strong phenological response to climatic variation compared to most other butterfly species that share its life history characteristics (univoltinism, pupal diapause). This pattern, in combination with it being a phenological specialist but a host species generalist, leads to substantial variation in host use both in time (Wiklund and Friberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>) and in space (this study). Unless the guild of its host plant species shows a very similar phenological alteration with the ongoing change in climate, which has been suggested for at least 
  <span class="italic">Alliaria petiolata</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Cardamine pratensis</span> in the UK (Sparks and Yates 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">1997</a>), the realized host use of the butterfly is likely to be affected. However, the pattern of spatial variation in host use demonstrated here indicates that the species as a whole appears to harbor the necessary genetic variation, allowing it to respond both ecologically and evolutionarily to a relatively large range of climatic variation.
