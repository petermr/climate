 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average advancement of mean flight date of all 66 butterfly species was 0.36 days/year during the last two decades. Moreover, the mean flight date of the same investigated butterfly species showed a positive correlation with latitude (mean value is 1.20 days/degree of latitude). The advancement in mean flight date as well as the seasonal advancement at lower latitudes was both greater in 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> than in the vast majority of other butterfly species in the region. It has advanced its mean flight dates during the last two decades with a mean value of 1.02 days/year, which is among the top three of all investigated butterfly species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). In addition, there are only 2 out of 66 species that show a steeper relationship between mean flight date and latitude than 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> (3.41 days/degree of latitude).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correlations between temporal and spatial trends were also evident in terms of a significant correlation between the yearly change in flight date and the dependence of flight date on latitude in the 66 species of butterflies investigated (

  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.015; cf. Fig. 5 in Karlsson 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>). In univoltine species overwintering as pupae, like 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span>, this relationship still holds true (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This suggests that spatial and temporal variations are partly caused by the same factors and that investigations of latitudinal trends should be useful to predict expected future temporal trends in butterfly species.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> is a univoltine species throughout its geographic range, it is of interest to restrict the comparison to species sharing this characteristic. Among the 66 species investigated by Karlsson (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">2013</a>), univoltine species generally have significantly later flight dates compared to bivoltine species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>) (and also compared to adult overwintering species where adults appear two times per season but with generally only one cohort of larvae developing each year) (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). 
  <span class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</span> has a relatively early flight also when compared only to other univoltine butterfly species; only 2 out of 46 investigated Swedish univoltine species fly at earlier dates than 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span>. To summarize, our focal species appears early in the season and much earlier at southern than at northern latitudes, and has advanced its flight dates in response to climate warming more strongly than most other butterfly species in the same area.
