 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A comparison with the records of 
  <span class="italic">A. cardamines</span> during 2010 registered in the Swedish Species Gateway indicated that our census periods occurred 4–6 days after the peak flight period in all three regions (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Together with the results of previous studies showing that the egg stage in the field lasts 7–10 days (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">1978</a>) and that ca. 80% of the eggs are laid during the first half of the flight season (Wiklund and Friberg 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">2009</a>), this strongly suggests that our census provided accurate assessments of host use in all regions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean number of eggs per plant (number of eggs/number of plants in each plot) varied among host species (Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>; Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). However, host use differed among the three regions (significant interaction region × species in Table 
  <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a>). In the south region, the most used species for oviposition was 
  <span class="italic">C. paludosa</span>, in the central region it was 
  <span class="italic">C. pratensis</span>, and in the north region, 
  <span class="italic">A. glabra</span> was the most attacked species (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a>). From the butterfly’s perspective, there was a difference between regions concerning which host plant was most used for oviposition (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
