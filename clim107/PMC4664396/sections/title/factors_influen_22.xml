 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results of niche modelling of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> in India show that most of the invasion risk is in the regions with high rainfall and warm climate. The regions with extreme cold and heat are less vulnerable to invasion under current as well as in future climate scenario. 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> have a broad altitudinal (1-1000m asl), precipitation (350-5000m/year) and temperature range (0°C to 45°C), but with an optimal temperature range from 22°C to 32°C [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref025">25</a>]. The ideal condition for their growth and activity is a good amount of rainfall, humidity, shade and optimum temperature [

  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref088">88</a>]. In our study also, in all three scenarios, temperature is the major influencing factor for distribution of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span>. Our model has predicted annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality and temperature annual range to be the major factors determining the invasion in all scenarios reinforcing the above results [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref088" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref088">88</a>]. The highest infestation takes place with the onset of monsoon (June) and remains active throughout the rainy season and start declining gradually from mid-November [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref089" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref089">89</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref090" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref090">90</a>]. Our study shows that the maximum invasion risk occurs between June and November during which India receives monsoon [

  <a rid="pone.0143724.g003" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0143724.g003">Fig 3b</a>). Apart from temperature and rainfall, altitude also plays a significant role in 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> invasion. Raut and Ghose [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref025">25</a>] reported that hilly regions of eastern and northern India above 1500m were not suitable due to low temperature. Raut [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref092" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref092">92</a>] reported that population of 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> decreased with the increase in altitude, this is also seen in our study. Thus, 
  <span class="italic">A</span>. 
  <span class="italic">fulica</span> distributions seem to be predominantly influenced by altitude, mean temperature and precipitation.
