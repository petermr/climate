  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref063">63</a>], but the magnitude of the potential impact on biodiversity remains largely unknown [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref064" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref064">64</a>]. Not all organisms respond in the same way across different spatial and temporal scales. Hence, specific information on a species’ response is required for effective conservation and management of biodiversity. Species may respond to climate change by adapting to changing environmental conditions, shifting their niche, expanding to newer areas or in the worst case scenario become extinct if unable to adapt to changing environment [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref065" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref065">65</a>]. Niche models can be helpful in predicting species’ distribution in relation to climate change. The climate change and invasive species together can have a drastic effect not only on biodiversity [
  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref015">15</a>] but also on human well-being [

  <a rid="pone.0143724.ref067" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref067">67</a>]. ENM has been used extensively to predict future ecologically suitable areas for the establishment of invasive alien species under changed climate scenario [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Current and future distribution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The maximum entropy niche modeling procedure was adopted here to understand 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> distributions in India under present conditions and three climate change scenarios and to identify the areas most vulnerable to invasion under changed climate. The models show high AUC values (&gt;0.94 for both test and training data) indicating that models successfully predict species distribution with a high degree of accuracy. An earlier work by Sridhar et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref071" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref071">71</a>] using CLIMEX model to predict 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> invasion under current climate scenario used much coarser grid (0.5° degrees) than the present study (30 arc seconds). This study showed that much of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, the warmer and drier regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat and some parts of North Eastern states are less vulnerable to invasion, which is also shown in our study. Apart from these states, most parts of India are highly prone to invasion [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref069" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref069">69</a>]. However, contrary to this, our study being at much finer scale emphasizes that not all parts of each state are equally vulnerable to invasion. Another study at a much smaller scale using maximum entropy modeling has predicted an increased infestation of 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> in Kerala [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref072" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref072">72</a>]. However, our results suggest that there is no significant difference between invasion risks in Kerala under current and all three future climate change scenarios.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all invasive species respond to climate change in a similar way. For example, some invasive species are likely to be reduced in range due to climate change [

   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref075" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref075">75</a>]. A recent study on Argentine ant invasions at global level have predicted reduced invasive potential, but there is potential for some regional expansions [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref076" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref076">76</a>]. On the contrary, increase in temperature expands range for some other invasive species like

   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref078" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref078">78</a>], especially in the southern Western Ghats and some species will undergo shifts in their range in future [

   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref080" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref080">80</a>]. The MaxEnt model results suggests that the climate change (under RCP 6.0) is likely to increase land area at risk of invasion by up to 1.04%. Currently less suitable regions might become more suitable and vice-versa under changed climate, especially in peninsular India, and eastern India.

   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref014">14</a>]. Naylor [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref081" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref081">81</a>] estimated that the total cost of

   <span class="italic">fulica</span> occurrence in this region despite all the efforts.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The invasion of 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> in India is a major problem, not only in semi-urban or peri-urban areas but also increasingly in rural areas. Agriculture, particularly in India with nearly 60% being rain-fed, has been a highly risky venture with extremities in monsoon coupled with other abiotic and biotic factors. Climate change is set to compound the daunting complex challenges already being faced by the farmers. Increasing temperature will have significant negative impact on crop yield [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref084" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref084">84</a>]. This along with land use and invasive species such as 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> will have even more impact on small-scale agriculture and horticulture. The invasion is particularly high during monsoon months (June to November) when most of the small-scale farmers grow vegetables and horticultural crops. We have found here that regions with high agriculture output in India also have high invasion risk. These regions include Kerala, coastal parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Assam [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref085" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref085">85</a>]. The slow growth regions in terms of agriculture such as Bihar and parts of Uttar Pradesh are also very economically backward regions and highly dependent on monsoon for good yield. These regions are also highly vulnerable to invasion. Increased invasion by 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> under future climate in these regions will only worsen the agriculture situation in India, thus further marginalizing the small-farming community and adversely impacting local economies.

   <span class="italic">fulica</span> not yet invaded forested regions of India. The impact of snail invasion on native snail fauna is not known. Given the high endemism in land snails in India [
