  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 231 records have been collated into the Achatina database. These came from two sources, a) for the global distribution the data was downloaded from GBIF, and b) for India, the sources were: i) published records on giant African snails in journals, books and reports, ii) specimens observed during field survey (mostly opportunistic sampling) by the authors, and iii) from the Zoological Survey of India Museum. Distribution data collected from these sources was converted into an MS excel format with specimen location, latitude, longitude, altitude and data source. All data were geocoded using Google Earth and/or Survey of India toposheets. The Garmin GPS was used to record the site of occurrence of each specimen for the primary data. The data for

   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref053" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref053">53</a>] for three different future climate scenarios. These were Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5)—each of which is based on one of three different levels of radiative forcing. These RCPs were developed by three different institutes. RCP 8.5 is characterized by increased greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 21st century that lead to high greenhouse gas concentrations over time. This RCP assumes there are no policy changes to reduce emissions in the future [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref054" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref054">54</a>]. RCP 6.0 is Intermediate emission scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized shortly after year 2100 by using range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. RCP 4.5 is a more optimistic scenario with emissions peak around 2040 and then decline [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maximum entropy modeling was used with the MaxEnt algorithm (version 3.3.3k) [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref055">55</a>] for quantifying relative risk of invasion and mapping the potential geographic distribution of 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> in India. The selection of MaxEnt is based on following reasons: (1) it is a presence-only modeling algorithm (i.e. absence data are not required); (2) the performance is relatively better than other modeling methods [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref056" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref056">56</a>]; and (3) the model is hardly influenced by small sample sizes and hence prediction will be relatively robust [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref050">50</a>,
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref057" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref057">57</a>]. MaxEnt estimates the probability of presence of a species based on presence records and randomly generated background points by finding the maximum entropy distribution [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref055">55</a>]. MaxEnt uses a regularization parameter to control over-fitting and can handle both categorical and continuous variables [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref055" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref055">55</a>]. It uses five different features viz., linear, quadratic, product, threshold, and hinge, to constrain the geographical distribution of a species. We have used “logistic” output format in MaxEnt, which is a continuous map with an estimated probability of species’ presence between 0 and 1, which allows us to make distinctions between the suitability of different areas [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref058" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref058">58</a>]. All 19 bioclim layers were tested for collinearity by examining pairwise correlations between them. When a pair of variables had a Pearson’s correlation coefficient &gt;0.75, one of the two variables was removed and finally only seven variables were used for ENM.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A jackknife procedure was used to calculate the significance of the contribution of each variable to the model. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (abbreviated as AUC) [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref059" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref059">59</a>] was used to evaluate model performance. The AUC is a threshold-independent measure of a model’s ability to discriminate presence from absence (or background). It varies from 0.5 to 1.0; an AUC value of 0.5 shows that model predictions are not better than random, values &lt;0.5 are worse than random, 0.5–0.7 signifies poor performance, 0.7–0.9 signifies reasonable/ moderate performance and &gt;0.9 indicates high model performance [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref060">60</a>]. Model validation was performed using the ‘sub-sampling’ procedure in MaxEnt. 75% of the 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span> data were used for model calibration and the remaining 25% for model validation. Ten replicates were run and average AUC values for training and test datasets were calculated. Maximum iterations were set at 5000. Percent variable contribution and jackknife procedures in MaxEnt were used to investigate the relative importance of different bioclimatic predictors. For the present study, we selected five arbitrary categories of the risk of invasion by 
   <span class="italic">A</span>. 
   <span class="italic">fulica</span>: very low (0.10–0.25), low (0.25–0.50), moderate (0.50–0.70), high (0.70–0.90) and very high (&gt;0.90) based on predicted habitat suitability as per Kumar et al. [
   <a rid="pone.0143724.ref061" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0143724.ref061">61</a>]. All GIS analysis was conducted in ArcGIS and statistical analysis was done in PAST 3.
