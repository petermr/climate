 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Translating climate trends into potential yield effects requires models. The Hybrid-Maize model was developed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the USA by combining the strengths of the existing specific models represented by CERES-Maize with organ growth and respiration functions from assimilation-driven generic crop models such as SUCROS and WOFOST

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. The Hybrid-Maize model can simulate maize yield under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. It can also simulate maize daily development and growth with minimal possible stress. Previous studies have shown that the model performed well in a variety of regions in China
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. In this study, we relied on the calibrated model from prior work

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To simulate grain yield, the Hybrid-Maize model requires input for daily total solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and evapotranspiration. Other model inputs include each variety’s GDD (GDD at silking and maturity), date of planting, and plant population density. In this study, the real sowing dates for varieties used in the 1980s and 2000s varieties (

  <span class="sup">−1</span> at all stations) were used in the simulation for both rainfed and irrigated maize with varieties from both the 1980s and 2000s. The change in atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> level since the 1980s has not been taken into account in the simulation because the Hybrid-Maize model does not consider CO
  <sub>2</sub> changes.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Hybrid-Maize model to relate past yield outcomes to weather realizations under a scenario in which varieties were constant, i.e., the same varieties used by farmers in the 1980s were used throughout the simulation; in other words, there was no adaptation to climate change in terms of variety (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). Similar simulations were also conducted for the varieties used by farmers in the 2000s. For the model simulation, grain yield with the climate of the 1980s or the 2000s was the average of the 10-year simulation with weather data from 1980–1989 or from 2000–2009, respectively.
