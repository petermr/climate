  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area included 14 provinces in the CMB. Weather data were obtained from 216 observational stations of the National Meteorological Networks of Central China Meteorological Agency
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>. These stations were chosen because they followed a south-to-north transect from low and middle latitudes in SW China to high latitudes in NE China (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>). Spring maize was the dominant maize system in the NE (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning Provinces), and the SW (Yunan, Guizhou, Chongqing, and Sichuan Provinces) while summer maize was the dominant system in the NCP (Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Beijing and Tianjin Provinces). In Shanxi and Shannxi Provinces in the NCP, maize was mainly sown in spring.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess how farmers have changed to longer-maturity varieties, we collected data on maize phenology (sowing, silking, and maturity dates) from both the 1980s and the 2000s from Agrometeorological Experimental Stations for each province in the CMB. Fifty agronomists at 50 experimental stations in the National Maize Production System in China were surveyed to verify the phenological information. The sowing, silking, and maturity dates for each province for varieties planted in the the 1980s and the 2000s are shown in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>. The parameter growing degree-days (GDD, ≥10 °C) was used to characterize the varieties and for model simulation. At each station in both the 1980s and the 2000s, the GDD is the average of all collected varieties at that time. According to the average phenological data, the total GDD, pre-, and post-silking GDDs for varieties from both the 1980s and 2000s were calculated based on the average temperature in each province
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>. Total, pre-, and post-silking GDDs for each province for varieties used in the 1980s and 2000s are shown in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S3</a>. For each province, an average GDD was used for crop model simulation.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soil data used in our study included soil texture, bulk density, initial soil moisture status, coverage of residues, and maximum root depth. These data were also obtained from the Agrometeorological Experimental Stations and the China Soil Scientific Database.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Translating climate trends into potential yield effects requires models. The Hybrid-Maize model was developed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in the USA by combining the strengths of the existing specific models represented by CERES-Maize with organ growth and respiration functions from assimilation-driven generic crop models such as SUCROS and WOFOST
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. The Hybrid-Maize model can simulate maize yield under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. It can also simulate maize daily development and growth with minimal possible stress. Previous studies have shown that the model performed well in a variety of regions in China
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. In this study, we relied on the calibrated model from prior work
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To simulate grain yield, the Hybrid-Maize model requires input for daily total solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and evapotranspiration. Other model inputs include each variety’s GDD (GDD at silking and maturity), date of planting, and plant population density. In this study, the real sowing dates for varieties used in the 1980s and 2000s varieties (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>) and plant population densities (60,000 plants ha
   <span class="sup">−1</span> at all stations) were used in the simulation for both rainfed and irrigated maize with varieties from both the 1980s and 2000s. The change in atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> level since the 1980s has not been taken into account in the simulation because the Hybrid-Maize model does not consider CO
   <sub>2</sub> changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used Hybrid-Maize model to relate past yield outcomes to weather realizations under a scenario in which varieties were constant, i.e., the same varieties used by farmers in the 1980s were used throughout the simulation; in other words, there was no adaptation to climate change in terms of variety (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). Similar simulations were also conducted for the varieties used by farmers in the 2000s. For the model simulation, grain yield with the climate of the 1980s or the 2000s was the average of the 10-year simulation with weather data from 1980–1989 or from 2000–2009, respectively.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the entire CMB, the following variables were analyzed with regression to estimate linear time trends from 1980–2009: mean temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation during the maize growing season for each year and each province. Linear time trends were also computed for the simulated grain yield from 1980–2009 based on varieties used in the 1980s. Students’ 
   <span class="italic">t</span>-tests with 95% or 99% confidence levels were used to evaluate the slope of the linear regression line against time. If a linear regression was significant, we used the average change from the 1980s to the 2000s to describe the overall trend. For the CMB as a whole, the climatic trends for climate and simulated maize yields were calculated as averages based on the area of each province. The relationship between rainfed maize yield as a percentage of irrigated maize yield and precipitation during the maize growing season was evaluated with the linear plateau model in SAS
