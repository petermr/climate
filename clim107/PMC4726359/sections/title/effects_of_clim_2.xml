  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>, maize yield of the 1980s variety for the entire CMB decreased by an average of 8% due to climate change from the 1980s to the 2000s for both irrigated maize (from 9.5–8.7 Mg ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and rainfed maize (from 8.9–8.2 Mg ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) ((grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates - grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*2000s’ climates)/grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). This decrease was greater than the 3.8% decrease in global maize yield attributed to climate over the same period
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>. Simulated yields with varieties used in the 1980s decreased by 10–11% in the NCP but by only 5–8% in the cold-temperate maize systems in the NE. For tropical and sub-tropical maize in SW China, grain yield has decreased 4% since the 1980s. The only area without negative effects of climate change (1980s vs. 2000s) was Heilongjiang Province (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S5</a>), which is located in northernmost region of China where the baseline temperature in the 1980s was not above the optimum for maximum grain yield
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. For all regions, the scenarios analysis for irrigated maize showed the attribution of maximum and minimum temperature for yield decrease from the 1980s to the 2000s was similar (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>). For NCP, the 4% yield decrease for irrigated maize from the 1980s to the 2000s was attributed to the decrease in solar radiation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To understand how farmers changed their crop management in response to warming since the 1980s, we collected information on sowing date and varieties. Sowing date was similar in the 1980s (average DOY = 135) and the 2000s (average DOY = 133) (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Figure S6</a>). Regarding varieties, those planted in the 2000s had significantly more total growth days (8 days more) than those planted in the 1980s. Of the additional growth days, seven occurred in the post-flowering reproductive stage. The total growing degree-days (GDD, ≥10 °C) were therefore 12% greater for varieties in the 2000s than for those used in the 1980s (1403 vs. 1575 GDD). The more recent varieties thus have more time for grain filling and use light, heat, and other resources more efficiently than the varieties used in the 1980s.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The yield performance was compared for combinations of two kinds of varieties (those planted in the 1980s and the 2000s) with two climate periods (the 1980s and the 2000s) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). For the entire CMB area, average grain yield increased by 11–16% (from 9.4–10.9 Mg ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for irrigated maize and from 8.9–9.9 Mg ha
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for rainfed maize) due to farmers switching to longer-maturing varieties from the 1980s to the 2000s ((grain yield of 2000s’ varieties*2000s’ climates - grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates)/grain yield of 1980s’ varieties*1980s’ climates). Observed maize yield increased 34% for the CMB between the 1980s and the 2000s
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>. This indicated that benefits from changing varieties represented 32–47% of the overall yield gains over this period. Similarly, 50–60% of maize yield increase was attributed to variety improvement (genetic improvement) in the USA
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. Among different regions, the highest yield increase was observed in the NE, where yield for the varieties used in the 2000s with the climate from the 2000s was 21% higher for irrigated maize (and 15% higher with rainfed maize) than with varieties used in the 1980s and with the climate from the 1980s. With the same comparisons of varieties and climate in SW China, the grain yield increased by 10% of for both water conditions. In the NCP, the grain yield increased as much as 16% for irrigated maize but by only 8% for rainfed maize. In most regions, the estimated effects of climate trends on new varieties were negative and with similar magnitude as effects on older varieties. This suggests that while the new varieties have helped offset climate-related losses, their yields would have been even higher without climate change.
