 <result pre="as well as taking advantage of the positive consequences of" exact="climate" post="change (e.g., growing wine in regions that were previously"/>
 <result pre="previously too cold for that purpose). This second response to" exact="climate" post="change is referred to as adaptation [ 2]. Implementing"/>
 <result pre="and adaptation is also important because the amount of individuals’" exact="greenhouse gas" post="emissions—and therefore the potential for emission reductions— is substantial"/>

 <result pre="One factor that is crucial for people’s motivation to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change is the extent to which people believe or"/>

 <result pre="people who are sceptical about the reality and relevance of" exact="climate" post="change may endorse adaptation measures. More specifically, if adaptation"/>
 <result pre="also [ 19]). In other words, it is possible that" exact="climate" post="change sceptics favour adaptation over mitigation because it allows"/>
 <result pre="them to stall and block mitigation efforts. Attitudes Until recently," exact="climate" post="change has almost exclusively been framed as an environmental"/>
