 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At least three limitations might have affected the findings of this research. The first issue we would like to discuss is the small amount of variance affective risk perception could explain with regard to the dependent variables. However, we believe that the weak predictive power of affective risk does 
  <span class="italic">not</span> indicate that this variable is irrelevant as a motivation to address climate change (see also the successful use of affect in previous studies [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref012">12</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref042">42</a>]). Instead, we believe that this weakness reflects the potential for methodical improvement, such as including several items rather than a single-item question.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, our samples were not representative of either the UK or Switzerland. However, given the moderate size of the samples (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 616 / 309) and given that the participants in the two samples cover a broad range of socio-demographic characteristics (
  <a rid="pone.0124843.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s006">S2</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0124843.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0124843.s007">S3</a> Tables), we are confident that our samples are diverse enough to study relationships between different social-psychological variables. We also think that given the different recruiting strategies and considering that survey contexts were markedly different, the highly similar results from the two samples speak of the external validity of our findings. However, without a more representative sample, we do not know whether our findings are limited to persons who are younger and comparatively better educated.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The third shortcoming of this research has to do with the selection of predictor variables. Although we included a variety of psychological processes to study similarities and differences between endorsement of mitigation and adaptation, there are other potentially relevant variables—for example, the extent to which people believe that the proposed measures will be effective (i.e., efficacy beliefs [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref028">28</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref030">30</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref052">52</a>]) and see themselves as personally capable of responding to climate change (i.e., self-efficacy beliefs [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref030">30</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref035">35</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref052">52</a>]. Other relevant processes might include perceived costs of responses [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref052">52</a>], experience with the effects of climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref035">35</a>], or beliefs and opinion of relevant others [
  <a rid="pone.0124843.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0124843.ref028">28</a>]. Studying these alternative predictors of endorsement of mitigation and adaptation could reveal that the motives to mitigate and to adapt vary more strongly than suggested by our findings.
