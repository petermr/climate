 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toward a Unifying Experimental Approach</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important shortcoming of previous approaches has been that experimental laboratory and field studies mostly tested one variable at a time. Additive or synergistic effects of various drivers, however, have occurred under climate change in the past and also characterize ongoing climate change (Pörtner et al. 
  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">2005</a>), for example, in the ocean (e.g., Boyd and Hutchins 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2012</a>; Pörtner 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2012</a>; Pörtner et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2014</a>). OCLTT illustrates a new way how to integrate different drivers and traits (Pörtner 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2010</a>) or how to parameterize fundamental traits for the modeling of functional limits, diseases, species abundances, biogeographical range. Increased variability and frequency of extreme events under climate change require consideration (Rahmstorf and Coumou 
  <a rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" href="#b37">2011</a>). Studies in thermal biology have often focused on the impact of shifting mean values on organisms but temperature variability may also act as a selective force (Pörtner and Knust 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2007</a>; Bozinovic et al. 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013a</a>; Clavijo-Baquet et al. 
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">2014</a>). The development of a widely accepted theoretical basis should relate physiology to population processes and address the role of temperature means and variability at higher ecological levels and their potentially nonadditive interaction shaping performance.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We therefore summarize the following core objectives of a comprehensive research program comprising ecophysiological approaches, acknowledging that studies of individual aspects are already underway in many laboratories worldwide. Most importantly, once results become available, they would need to be interpreted in the context of conceptual frameworks such as OCLTT in animals and others that still need to be developed across organism domains:</p>
 <div list-type="order" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>To determine the effects of isolated and coupled climate variables at physiological levels of different taxonomic groups; and to determine the bases of sublethal and lethal stress and capacities to respond to stresses induced by climate. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To explore the physical, chemical, and biotic factors that affect and limit the distribution of species. At distribution limits, these factors may well indicate some of the likely consequences of climate change in the future. Such analyses may be most important in species that face extreme conditions today. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To study the relationship between tolerances and climate in scenarios of climate change; as well as to analyze how trade-offs in genetic adaptation may set limits to distribution and abundance. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To assess how phenotypic traits are affected by high levels of environmental variability encountered over large geographic distances, but also over long time scales. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To identify how physical, chemical, and biotic factors linked to climate change induce noxious phenotypic states in some species but not in others, and shape the distribution and coexistence of species. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To test how trophic interactions (e.g., plant–herbivore) are affected by changes in temperature and how it may impact community structure and function. In this case, an herbivore may alter how species respond to raised temperatures. This dependency in the response of both herbivore and plant to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be an import avenue of research. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To determine the limits and pathways of genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and life-history strategies to climate change and to analyze how different life-history stages are affected by climate variables. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p> To improve the capacity of modeling tools used to predict effects of climate on species distributions and abundances, by incorporating physiological and molecular information. </p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ecologists would need to consider this framework when developing different models of how functional biodiversity can be impacted by climate change. Many of them concur that these models lack or oversimplify the physiological basis of climate change responses, which may lead to very large under- or overestimations of risks and vulnerabilities for individuals, species, and ecosystems (Huey et al. 
  <a rid="b23" ref-type="bibr" href="#b23">2009</a>). Thus, research programs should incorporate physiological approaches, also when exploring conservation, restoration, and management.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC (
  <a rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" href="#b24">2014</a>) concluded that during the course of this century, the ability of many organisms and ecosystems to adapt naturally is likely to be surpassed by an unprecedented rate of climate change, an unprecedented combination of changes in climate, associated extreme events, and anthropogenic influences such as pollution, eutrophication, overexploitation, land use, and other disturbances. As a consequence, nearly 20–30% of biodiversity are at increasing risk of extinction as global mean temperatures increase by 2 to 3°C above preindustrial levels. Our proposal is that a solid and mechanistic foundation is required for developing projections of probable outcomes under climate change (Estay et al. 
  <a rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16">2014</a>; Pörtner et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2014</a>). Development of unifying concepts such as OCLTT is relevant for interpreting existing and future findings in a coherent way and for projecting the future ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change on whole-organism and ecosystem functioning (Bozinovic et al. 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2011a</a>,
  <a rid="b6" ref-type="bibr" href="#b6">b</a>, 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013a</a>,
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">b</a>; Folguera et al. 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2011</a>; Pörtner et al. 
  <a rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" href="#b36">2014</a>).
