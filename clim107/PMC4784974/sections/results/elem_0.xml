 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assembled a total of 1677 unique occurrences for BTV around the world for model calibration. These points were filtered down to 1260 records in individual pixels. The overall pattern of occurrences indicated a geographically broad distribution of BTV, with more intense sampling efforts in Europe, where the virus invaded recently (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g001" href="#pone.0150489.g001">Fig 1</a>). Sampling was much more sparse in Africa and South America. Most BTV records were outside the early geographic belt identified for BTV distribution [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The potential distribution of BTV under present-day conditions showed high suitability across southern Europe, Australia, the Indian Subcontinent, and northern and southern Africa (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g002" href="#pone.0150489.g002">Fig 2</a>). BTV occurred in tropical, subtropical, and temperate climate zones. Suitable areas were also identified in West Africa, United States, and southern and western Canada. In all, the model outputs corresponded well to known areas of transmission around the world. Model predictions were significantly better than random expectations, in that partial ROC AUC ratios were uniformly higher than the random classifier with an AUC ratio of 1 (
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). The data set of 331 independent records was used to evaluate the robustness of our models in anticipating the current outbreaks across southern Europe, North Africa, and the United States. The model was significantly able to anticipate all 331 points reported for the most recent outbreaks of BTV (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BTV model transfers to future conditions indicated a pattern that was overall similar to that estimated for present-day conditions. However, the potential distribution of the virus under future conditions was broader, and included areas not identified as suitable under current conditions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g004" href="#pone.0150489.g004">Fig 4</a>). This potential for expansion was particularly notable in central Africa, the United States, and western Russia. Under all future climate scenarios, the virus was seen to have a broader potential geographic distribution than at present (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150489.g004" href="#pone.0150489.g004">Fig 4</a>). We noted few differences between GCMs within each climate scenario, such that model predictions were consistent over much of the world, with exceptions in western Russia, northern Europe, western South America, and Indonesia, where future projections were less stable (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BTV range increased from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5 (potential distributional area increased by 8.11% between present-day and RCP 2.6, and by 9.08% between present-day and RCP 8.5). Differences were also noted in the future potential BTV ranges of different models within each climate scenario (
