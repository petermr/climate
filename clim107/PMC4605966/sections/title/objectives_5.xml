 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were two significant problems in our previous report [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. First, despite the importance of the carbon storage volume of domestically produced HWPs from a country’s forests (namely the production approach) to the UNFCCC, our previous model could not indicate the detail of HWPs produced from domestic forests, and therefore an adequate assessment of the carbon storage volume and future changes relating to HWPs derived from domestic production in each region was not possible. Second, for the climate change mitigation effect, only the carbon storage effect and energy substitution effect were targeted, and it was not feasible to address the overall mitigation effect that takes into account the material substitution effect.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, therefore, the first area of concern has been addressed through a number of future scenarios relating to HWPs derived from domestic forests, which consider the future of the domestic forestry industry and of HWP use from various viewpoints. Furthermore, carbon storage volume and its future changes are estimated using the production approach with country-specific methods [

The second point of concern has been addressed through the evaluation of the overall climate change mitigation effect, which takes into account the material substitution effect. The initial projection year was also changed from 2005 in the previous model to 2014, to include the most recent figures available. As a result, it was possible to reflect in the projections the impact on HWP supply and demand of such things as the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 and the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. Further considerations included the civil engineering field as an application for HWPs and the use of logging residue for energy generation. As a result, the problems with the previous model were resolved, giving rise to an improved comprehensive model (hereinafter “new model”). Based on the new model, the HWP carbon balance in each region of Japan was evaluated, and the overall climate change mitigation effect to 2050 was estimated, in line with multiple future scenarios. For future studies, this new model plays the part of an integrated carbon balance model for the Japanese forest sector combining forests and HWPs [
