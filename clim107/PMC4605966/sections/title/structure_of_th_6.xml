 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new model for evaluating the HWP carbon balance used in this study is outlined in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>. Its basic structure follows that of the previous model. The structure formulates (1) HWP flow, from roundwood production to sawnwood (including glued laminated lumber and laminated veneer lumber), plywood (including wood-based panels such as particle board and fiberboard) and chip production and HWP consumption (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper) and to energy use (logging residue, processing residue, waste wood); and (2) HWP stock (building construction, civil engineering, furniture, paper). Moreover, the model evaluates the climate change mitigation effect based on the carbon balance implied by this HWP flow and stock.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the volume of Japanese HWP imports is very large (71 % of the volume of the overall HWP supply in 2013) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], the model targets not only domestically produced HWPs but also imported HWPs. However, when assessing carbon balance, the carbon storage in HWP derived from only domestic forests (excluding imports) and its future changes, are estimated using the production approach. The volume of Japanese HWP exports has remained below 3 % of the volume of overall HWP demand for more than 50 years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>], and the export volume for each application has been unclear. According to the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol of the IPCC [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>], the annual change in carbon storage in HWPs is assumed to be zero (instantaneous oxidation) when transparent and verifiable activity data are not available. Therefore, HWP exports were not taken into consideration.
