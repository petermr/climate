 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate related disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and bush-fires are often associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders. Individuals who have been exposed to life threatening situations are at a considerable risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[

  <a rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref22">22</a>] The symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks of the event, increased arousal and avoidance of cues to the memory of the event. In many cases, the symptoms of PTSD may have a delayed onset, months to years after the experiencing of threatening disaster situation.[

  <a rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref24">24</a>] Development of PTSD is associated with impairment in the quality of life and significant subjective distress.[

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individuals who have been through the experience of climate related natural disaster are not only at a higher risk of developing PTSD, but also at a greater risk of developing acute stress reaction and adjustment disorder.[

  <a rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref27">27</a>] These disorders are anxiety spectrum disorders which can subside over a period of time with rehabilitations and/or treatment. Other stress exacerbated disorder includes development of acute and transient psychosis and relapse of bipolar disorder. Faced with the loss of home, environment, social structures and loved ones, an individual may develop a bereavement (grief reaction) or depression. The depression is likely to be more pronounced in those who live in small rural communities, than those living in big cities.[
  <a rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref28">28</a>] As the impact of climate change seems to be increasing over the time period, it is likely that a greater proportion of the population would be impacted by the mental health consequences of climate change related disasters.[
