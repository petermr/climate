 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Human activities are changing Earth’s climate,” reads the opening sentence of the American Geophysical Union’s position statement on climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref001">1</a>]. The same point is central to statements by other science organizations, broad interdisciplinary reviews [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref002">2</a>], direct surveys of scientists [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref003">3</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref004">4</a>], and literature reviews [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref005">5</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref006">6</a>]. No major science organization takes a contrary position that human activities are not changing the Earth’s climate [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the scientific consensus has strengthened, public opinion remains seriously divided, without a clear trend [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref008">8</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref009">9</a>]. Repeated surveys report annual-scale variations possibly related to developments such as release of the 2007 IPCC report, the 2008 economic crisis, “climategate” attacks on scientists in 2009, or a snowy northeastern US winter in 2011 [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref010">10</a>][
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref011">11</a>]. Decadal-scale surveys provide essential perspective, but must employ questions with wording that has changed over the years, or else was frozen at a time when the discourse was different. Whereas recent scientific statements emphasize the term “climate change,” referencing regional differences and shifts in precipitation, storms or extreme events, the legacy survey questions often ask about “global warming” instead. Non-scientists sometimes misinterpret this term to mean that every place should be constantly warming, which seems easily refuted by pointing out a place that is cooling. Moreover, there has been publicity about a “pause” or slowdown in the rate of global air temperature rise, leading to unscientific claims that global warming had stopped [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref012">12</a>]. The term “global warming” by itself apparently can elicit more conservative opposition than the term “climate change” on surveys [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref013">13</a>]. A potentially greater problem with wording is that some of the longest-running survey questions do not specify human causation, which today (rather than the mere fact of change) forms the main point of public contention [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref014">14</a>]. The reality of climate change has been publicly acknowledged even by political leaders who dismiss human causation as a hoax [
  <a rid="pone.0138208.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138208.ref015">15</a>]. These complications in public discourse make it harder to interpret responses to survey questions designed long ago.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To unambiguously track public acceptance of the scientific consensus, in 2010 we started asking a question with three response choices:</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Which of the following three statements do you personally believe?</p>
 <div list-type="simple" class="list" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Climate change is happening now, but caused mainly by natural forces.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="list-item">
   <p>Climate change is NOT happening now.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents can also say they don’t know, or decline to answer. Our question is present-tense and neutrally worded, with no mention of policies or future consequences. One response corresponds to the central point of scientific consensus statements, while others present the main logical alternatives. Although some scientists might argue that “belief” is the wrong term for their conclusions, it makes more sense with regard to acceptance by the general public. Trained telephone or face-to-face interviewers read the response choices in rotating order to avoid possible bias. From 2010 to 2015 over 28,000 people answered this question on 35 random-sample surveys, including the benchmark General Social Survey and a unique statewide time series.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Below we synthesize data from all of these surveys, analyzing them in a common multivariate framework. Logistic regression quantifies the effects of respondent age, gender, education and political orientation. This broad replication establishes a set of robust and consistent results. Regional surveys reflect the scale of place-to-place variation in climate-change beliefs, while the single-state time series shows temporal variation, permitting tests for the influence of daily weather, seasons and trends.</p>
