 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three US nationwide surveys, 11 surveys in selected, often rural US regions, and a series of 21 surveys in the state of New Hampshire comprise the data for this paper. Individual surveys, which include questions on many topics besides climate, have been introduced in previous papers. Here we undertake the first synthesis bringing all of them together, and analyzing responses to the common climate-change question.</p>

The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, supported by the National Science Foundation, conducts the GSS and publishes its data as a resource for research. Intensive sampling and diagnostic efforts make GSS a benchmark for representativeness among US surveys. The 2012 response rate is given as 71%. Our analysis applies probability weights (variable

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These telephone surveys, done by the UNH Survey Center under direction of Carsey School researchers, employ sampling, interviewing and weighting methods similar to those of NCERA. They target small clusters of counties, many of them nonmetropolitan. The locations are diverse but selected non-randomly for different projects. The CERA and CAFOR surveys used here involve regions in Appalachia, the Columbia River, Gulf Coast Florida, Gulf Coast Louisiana, northern New England, eastern Oregon, the Olympic Peninsula, Puget Sound, and southeast Alaska.

For all analyses here we adopt the original CERA or CAFOR weighting schemes, which take into account household size, county adult population and age-sex or age-sex-race distributions.
