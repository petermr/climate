The different surveys line up surprisingly well, with New Hampshire results a few points higher. 
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a> gives a visual impression of slight upward drift, to be tested by the

  <a rid="pone.0138208.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0138208.t002">Table 2</a>. In the New Hampshire time line we see no sign of a lasting impact from Hurricane Sandy, which brushed this state but caused no disaster there in late October 2012 (between our October 2012 and January 2013 surveys).

  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2A</a> covers a deep partisan divide (
  <a rid="pone.0138208.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138208.g002">Fig 2B</a>). Overall around 80% of New Hampshire Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 31% of Republicans agree with the scientific consensus that climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities. This partisan gap is one of the largest in questions asked on our surveys. The gap is somewhat greater in New Hampshire than nationally, partly reflecting a higher proportion of college graduates who, as will be seen, tend to be most polarized on this issue. For GSS the partisan gap is just 27 points, but even that is wider than historically polarizing abortion or gun control questions asked on the same survey. Surveys using different questions suggest that partisan gaps in climate beliefs have widened over the past decade [
