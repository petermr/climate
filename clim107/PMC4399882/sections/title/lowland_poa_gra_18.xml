 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The area climatically suitable for GPL by 2050 and 2080 is also projected to contract strongly, although a slightly larger area remains suitable compared to GTL. There are small areas within the current distribution that are projected to remain suitable for GPL by the end of the century by at least one model (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7920 ha of GPL are currently considered to be in good condition (
  <a rid="pone.0124014.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124014.t002">Table 2</a>). All models agree that 46% of the current good condition GPL grasslands will no longer be climatically suitable by 2080 (
  <a rid="pone.0124014.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0124014.t003">Table 3</a>). The extent of GPL projected to have suitable climate by 2080 varies between models (range 2–53%, multi-model mean 16%).
