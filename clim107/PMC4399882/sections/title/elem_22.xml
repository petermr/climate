One climate model, MIROC3.2 (medres), projects a very small area remaining suitable for both species. This climate model is wetter and slightly cooler than the mean of all climate models in the CMIP3 archive. The projections for 
  <span class="italic">Poa</span> show stronger contraction than 
  <span class="italic">Themeda</span> over the same time period, although its current extent is substantially greater.

   <p>White represents areas that are not climatically suitable. Areas currently climatically suitable are shown in grey, those projected to be climatically suitable by 
    <span class="bold">at least</span> one of the six climate models by 2050 are shown in pink and by 2080 in red. The overlap of the current (grey) and the projections to 2050 or 2080 can be seen in dark red. Black indicates the areas where 
    <span class="bold">all</span> climate models agree that currently suitable climate will persist by 2080.
