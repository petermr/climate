 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the baseline survey, all respondents first answered questions that elicited general attitudes toward climate change science and assessed knowledge about climate science (e.g., being able to name greenhouse gases). Next, the participants were randomly assigned to one of three equal groups. The control group received no information to provide benchmark measurements of (a) beliefs about the scientific consensus and (b) the relationships between beliefs about the scientific consensus, beliefs about climate change, and political ideology.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The treatment group viewed a screen with the following passage that informed them about scientists’ beliefs about climate change (“hard information treatment,” hereafter HI). To present the information as objectively as possible, we used exact quotes from the survey of scientists from which the information was obtained.</p>

  <p>
   <span class="italic">“There is strong scientific consensus about the occurrence and cause of global warming</span>. 
   <span class="italic">The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that global warming is already underway and that human activities are accelerating it</span>.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This treatment allows us to test whether simply drawing respondents’ attention to the fact that a consensus exists, without providing any concrete evidence, affects beliefs. Here, we are agnostic as to whether the impact on beliefs, if any, is due to (a) being reminded about something subjects already knew (the salience channel), (b) the novelty of this vague information to at least some subjects, or (c) both.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the information screen, the HI group answered questions about the credibility of the information we provided in order to gauge their level of skepticism. The SI and the control groups answered questions about their perception of what scientists believe. It is possible that by asking HI respondents about the credibility of the information, we caused some subjects to think that the information was incorrect, undermining its credibility. If that were the case, our estimated treatment effect would have been 
  <span class="italic">smaller</span> than if we had asked the questions about the credibility of the information last.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All groups then answered the same key questions of interest, which elicited respondents’ own beliefs about climate change and their willingness to sacrifice a portion of a monetary prize in order to contribute toward a cause that counters climate change by promoting energy efficiency. The wording of the statements was chosen to correspond closely to the scientist survey in [
  <a rid="pone.0151469.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0151469.ref001">1</a>]. Specifically, questions regarding beliefs about climate change were phrased in the following way.

  </p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then asked the following question to gauge whether beliefs translate into willingness to pay.</p>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>
   <span class="italic">After completing the survey</span>, 
   <span class="italic">you will be entered in a drawing for one of six $50 prizes</span>. 
   <span class="italic">You have the option to send part of your winnings to Alliance to Save Energy</span>, 
   <span class="italic">a nonprofit organization that is working to prevent the onset of climate change through promoting energy efficiency</span>. 
   <span class="italic">Should you win</span>, 
   <span class="italic">the amount will be deducted prior to you receiving the prize money and anonymously sent to Alliance to Save Energy</span>.
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="disp-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <p>
   <span class="italic">If you win one of the prizes</span>, 
   <span class="italic">how much of your winnings do you want sent to Alliance to Save Energy</span>? 
   <span class="italic">Enter a dollar amount between $0 and $50</span>.
  </p>
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decision about donations was thus incentivized by asking respondents how much of their own potential winnings they would be willing to sacrifice to address the issue of climate change. We selected a relatively unknown organization, whose methods (promoting energy efficiency) are relatively uncontroversial, conditional on being involved in climate change. By specifying that the donation would be “anonymously sent”, we tried to reduce the possibility that the study would be viewed as being associated with or conducted by that organization. However, because this question was last among those used to elicit climate change beliefs, any differential skepticism on behalf of the treated and control groups at this point could not have affected answers to the previous questions.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey concluded with detailed demographic questions including ideology and educational attainment. Finally, in order to see whether the treatment produced lasting effects, we conducted a follow-up survey 6 months later. The key questions were identical to the baseline except that the follow-up survey did not contain any treatment or treatment-specific questions.</p>
