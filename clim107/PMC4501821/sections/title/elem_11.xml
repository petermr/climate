  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The required tree and stand information were available from PSP datasets maintained by NS DNR. Permission to use the permanent sample plot data was granted by the NS DNR under a fair-use data agreement with The University of New Brunswick, Canada. Data collection did not involve any destructive sampling of either endangered or protected forest species. The data for this study was obtained from 3250 PSPs established to update forest inventories. Each PSP was of 0.04 ha (fixed size) and circular in shape with a radius of 11.35 m. Measurement of traditional inventory attributes included tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height. Data collection included only trees with a DBH &gt; 9.1 cm. Inventory measurements were collected every five years since ~1960’s, with the most recent data collected in 2006. Analysis of PSP data indicated an average DBH of 15.99 cm (Min = 9.1; Max = 99.6) and an average height of 10.52 m (Min = 0.6; Max = 24.9).</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Input data required to predict future forest states with JABOWA-3 includes (i) climatic information, (ii) initial stand conditions, and (iii) site conditions, including soil information. Projected future climate data (climate change) were acquired from Environment Canada [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref039" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref039">39</a>]. The information related to site conditions was extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and GIS thematic maps of NS, while soil-related information was acquired from the Canadian Soil Information Service (CANSIS) [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref040" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref040">40</a>]. Initial stand conditions were based on PSP records. Tree growth projections were developed for 34 PSP locations across NS, selected to represent nine eco-regions and capture the diverse climatic and site growing conditions of NS. The model was first calibrated using historical weather records and observed PSP data from NS [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref041">41</a>]. JABOWA-3 was initiated with existing stand conditions using relevant projected future climates. The model was run 5–7 times for each location to lessen the effect of model stochasticity inherent in model functions of mortality and ingrowth. Individual-tree diameter and height dynamics for the next 90 years were extracted from JABOWA-3 outputs under three projected climate-change scenarios.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future climate data used for model prediction were derived from the third generation Canadian-GCM (CGCM3-T47) for the fourth assessment period of the IPCC [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref001">1</a>]. Climate data produced were based on future emission scenarios of greenhouse gases defined by IPCC. Three illustrative emission scenarios chosen for the study include B1, A1B, and A2 [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref042">42</a>]. The emission scenarios were based on future global development with a particular emphasis on greenhouse gases and aerosol-precursor emissions [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref043">43</a>]. The A1B scenario was developed to reflect the world in an era of balanced energy use of fossil and non-fossil fuels, rapidly growing economy, and an increasing world population achieving a maximum in the middle of the current century. The B1 scenario reflects an environment friendly world, population trend similar to A1B, and global economy rapidly moving towards a service and information framework with the introduction of clean and efficient energy technologies. The A2 scenario signifies a heterogeneous world, moderate economic growth, and high population growth throughout the century [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref042">42</a>]. Ninety year projections of monthly mean temperatures and precipitation (2012–2102) relevant to selected locations of NS were obtained from the CGCM3-T47 simulations for B1, A1B, and A2 climate scenarios. Discrepancy in CGCM3-T47 produced data was calculated by comparing past weather records with the relevant predictions for each location. Monthly mean temperatures were adjusted by accounting for the mean bias, whereas ratio adjustments were used to correct future estimates of precipitation [
   <a rid="pone.0132066.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref029">29</a>]. In this study, we define B1 as a minimal impact, A1B as a moderate impact, and A2 as a maximum impact scenario.
