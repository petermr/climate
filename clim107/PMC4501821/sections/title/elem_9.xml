 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Province of NS is located on the east coast of Canada (43°27' N—46° 01' N; 59° 38' W- 66° 16' W). Elevation of the area ranges from 0–540 m above mean sea level. The current climate of the region is temperate humid with an average annual precipitation of 1425 mm along the coast and 1000 mm inland. Average daily air temperature ranges from 16–24°C in summer and around -3°C during winter. Annual GDD (base temperature of 5°C) for the province vary from 1500 to 1750 [
  <a rid="pone.0132066.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0132066.ref036">36</a>]. Under Canadian-GCM projections, GDDs are expected to increase by about 800–1400 at the end of 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century. Forests cover 77% of the province, with 50% classified as softwood, 11% as hardwood, 25% as mixedwood, and the remaining 14% as unclassified forests [

  <span class="italic">Picea sp</span>.) at 35% of total wood volume, balsam fir (
  <span class="italic">Abies balsamea</span>) at 22%, and broadleaved species at 30% [
