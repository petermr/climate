 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The intervals of distance and time of each dispatch are shown in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T2" href="#T2">2</a> with the route-planning function of Google Map. For this project, 2 departure sites have been set: Xiaolin village and Jiasion elementary school (MEMC) but different destinations, ipso facto. Although the best suggested routes by Google Map (top-ranked routes) are usually preferred, sometimes different selections among the Google-suggested routes are more reasonable and efficient, due to factors such as the comparison between the time and the distance in real-life circumstances for such incidents in both methods. To minimize the discrepancy between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, the scenarios analyzed in this project are based on the following conditions: same destinations, same ratios of casualty distribution, and same road-routing program. A scenario of conventional method is shown in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">2</a>: Panel A depicts the casualties being transported directly to different lines of hospitals without any programmed retention; Panel B depicts that the survivors of the sequential-conveyance method are first transferred to an MEMC for triaging, stabilizing, care-giving, and sheltering. Additionally, a programmatic and a subsequent transferral for the serious casualties is indicated by physicians in an MEMC.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case study of Xiaolin village, values of TE and DE have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of EMS transportation time and distance, respectively. One hundred thirty-five people evacuated this event (p + q = 135) and 16 of them are sent to hospitals (q = 16). The ratios of the survivor flow to different destinations are shown in Table 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="T1" href="#T1">1</a>. Accordingly, the evaluation of the efficiency of the transportation time and distance in realistic conditions are TE = 0.5215 (52.15%) and DE = 0.5602 (56.02%) (see Eq. 10 and 17, Supplemental Content, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MD/A81" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://links.lww.com/MD/A81</span>, which show the deduction and computation processes analytically). These values show the predominance of the sequential-conveyance method over the conventional method in transportation time and distance of an EMS transportation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relations between the MEMC retention and the TE or the DE are depicted in Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>. In a concept of probability, each survivor would be transferred to each refuge or hospital equally and randomly. However, the PR in different supposed values would meet different T
  <sub>CM</sub> and T
  <sub>SM</sub> (see Eqs. 12 and 18, Supplemental Content, 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/MD/A81" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://links.lww.com/MD/A81</span>, which illustrate the connection between TE and PR, and between DE and PR, respectively) by permutation and combination algorithm in the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. If a maximum T
  <sub>CM</sub> encounters a minimum T
  <sub>SM</sub> by a fixed PR, a maximum TE boundary (TEmax) (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>: Panel A) can be obtained. On the contrary, when a minimum T
  <sub>CM</sub> encounters a maximum T
  <sub>SM</sub>, a minimum TE (TEmin) is acquired. However, in a retrospective case study, the patient and the nonpatient flow of each hospital and each refuge, respectively, are kept in a determinate ratio (a fixed PR). In such situations, the maximum and minimum values of TE depend on the MEMC retention for the patients. Therefore, due to the MEMC retention (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>: Panel A), an apparent TEmax (app. TEmax) and an apparent TEmin (app. TEmin) calculations are executed to evaluate the effect of the sequential-conveyance method. The same mathematical logic is applied for DEmax, DEmin, app. DEmax, and app. DEmin calculations (Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">3</a>: Panel B). In the real case of Xiaolin, if 16 patients (
  <span class="italic">PR</span> ≅ 0.1185) were subjected to the MEMC retention, the app. TEmax = 63.22% and app. DEmax = 66.88% would be obtained. Alternatively, since the patients are not retented to an MEMC, the app. TEmin = 52.15% and app. DEmin = 56.02% are obtained. These values are also equal to TE and DE, respectively.
