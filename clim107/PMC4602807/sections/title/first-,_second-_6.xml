 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Taiwan, hospitals are basically classified into 3 different levels: the local community hospitals, the metropolitan hospitals, and the academic medical centers, depending on the evaluation of the quality and the quantity of the medical care. Typically, the services of the high-level hospitals are mostly related to serious health incidents, whereas low-level hospitals are for minor and nonurgent incidents. For this study, the EMS transportation for the local community hospitals is referred as first-line (1st-L H), for the metropolitan hospitals as second-line (2nd-L H), and for the academic medical centers as third-line hospitals (3rd-L H).</p>
