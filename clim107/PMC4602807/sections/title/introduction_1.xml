 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Over the last few decades, catastrophic effects of the climate change have drawn the attention of researchers worldwide.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>–
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>
  </span> Diseases, injuries, and also deaths have resulted from storms, floods, droughts, fires, and heat waves, disasters which are on the increase.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">2</a>,
   <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>–
   <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>
  </span> As a consequence, the large casualty caseloads led the emergency medical service (EMS) system to plan an adequate adaptation.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>,
   <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>
  </span> Indeed, plethora of articles have been published to document the impact of the climate change on the EMS and the emergency medicine.

   <a rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" href="#R9">9</a>,

  </span>
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During a mass-casualty incidence (MCI), the EMS transportation will be overwhelmed by the heavy caseload of casualties. Researchers and planners are concerned to shorten the referral and to save the golden hours.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">13</a>–
   <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>
  </span> Plans, such as the 3 phases of prehospital patient care after an earthquake, are reviewed to reduce the immediate mortality.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>
  </span> Moreover, other researchers apply the geographic information system (GIS) for a path design for effective time-saving transportation.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>
  </span> In addition to all these, aerotransportation is another main force during an MCI, which is suggested to overcome the difficulties of the on-land transportation.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How will the front-line workforce, the EMS, perform the duty of transportation effectively and save the golden hours for the casualties during a catastrophic event?
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>
  </span> Do the medical professionals arrive at the MCI and take care of casualties with nimble deftness?
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>
  </span> In this article, innovative ideas and plans for the EMS transportation and prehospital care are introduced, to abate the torment of sufferers from the tragedies caused by extreme climatic events.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A scenario of an effective EMS transportation, which is called the sequential-conveyance method in an MCI, is designed to shorten the transportation time and distance and to articulate with prehospital emergency care. Furthermore, an alternative concept of a mobile emergency medical center (MEMC) is introduced to integrate the EMS experts and the medics, so to act cooperatively and systematically. This MEMC is responsive to calamities and fully prepared to offer the emergency medical care close to the disaster area.</p>
