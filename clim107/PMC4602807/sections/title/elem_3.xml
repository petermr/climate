  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The definition of ambulances is general and it refers to both urgent and nonurgent ambulances. All types of ambulances are acceptable, but some calibrations of time used may be performed for certain types of ambulances.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">EMS Adaptation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of climate change, which is almost unavoidable, EMS itself should concentrate on all the required dynamic changes to adjust to the new environmental and social conditions, which is required to act adequately in every situation.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First-, Second-, and Third-line Hospitals</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Taiwan, hospitals are basically classified into 3 different levels: the local community hospitals, the metropolitan hospitals, and the academic medical centers, depending on the evaluation of the quality and the quantity of the medical care. Typically, the services of the high-level hospitals are mostly related to serious health incidents, whereas low-level hospitals are for minor and nonurgent incidents. For this study, the EMS transportation for the local community hospitals is referred as first-line (1st-L H), for the metropolitan hospitals as second-line (2nd-L H), and for the academic medical centers as third-line hospitals (3rd-L H).</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MEMC</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What is proposed as a MEMC is a surge refuge, which is hybridized with a disaster-medical-aid center. The MEMCs have many differences compared with the traditional disaster-medical-aid centers or the casualty-collection points.

   </span> To evacuate the area of an MCI, all the survivors, including the casualties, will be transferred to MEMCs, so that the required emergency medical treatment for injuries will be given. These MEMCs are the only intermediate facilities from the disaster area to the hospitals. Fully equipped trailers with medical personnel and necessities reach a specific location that must be safe and wide. Meanwhile, armamentaria and manpower are ready for patient care. Physicians in a MEMC can do further professional triage and assign transferrals of the second-line ambulances to the requested hospitals. This analysis mostly focuses on the aspects of the emergency transportation in MEMCs.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Survivors in a catastrophic event or an MCI are classified into 2 categories: the nonpatients (p) and the patients (q). Accordingly, the patient ratio (PR) can be presented by the following formula: PR = q/(p + q)</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sequential-Conveyance Method</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For this EMS transportation, ambulances are categorized into 2 different lines. The first-line ambulances (1st-L ABL) transfer patients between the disaster area and a MEMC reciprocately. The benefits of this class are the saving of time and shortening of working distances. The second-line ambulances (2nd-L ABL) transfer patients between a MEMC and the requested hospitals, an action that directly transports heavily injured patients to specific hospitals only under the guidance of the physicians. A comparison between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method is depicted in Figure

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the efficiency of the EMS transportation between the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method, the difference of the required time and the difference of the distance of these 2 methods are estimated. The subtraction of the total EMS transportation time of the conventional (T
   <sub>CM</sub>) method from that of the sequential-conveyance method (T
   <sub>SM</sub>) divided by T
   <sub>CM</sub> equals to TE. The subtraction of the total transportation distance of the conventional (D
   <sub>CM</sub>) method from that of the sequential-conveyance method (D
   <sub>SM</sub>) divided by D
   <sub>CM</sub> equals to DE.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Total Transportation Time/Distance</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total transportation time is the required time for the action of an EMS transportation; it also includes the time destined for the incident area, the refuges, or the hospitals, the time for the triage, and the prehospital emergency care. Yet, the total transportation distance is the aggregate journey of the ambulances.</p>
