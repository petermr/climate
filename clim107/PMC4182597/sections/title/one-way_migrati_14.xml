 <div class="title">One-way migration distances calculated as mid–point to mid–point of their summer and winter geographic ranges.</div>
 <p>Ranges were downloaded from the NatureServe database. Horizontal lines separate dispersal distances as ranked in 
  <a rid="pone-0108899-t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone-0108899-t001">Table 1</a>, with the shortest distances associated with rank 1 and the greatest distances with rank 5. The exceptions are the Bristle–thighed Curlew and Bar–tailed Godwit, which do not overwinter in the New World so they are not covered by the database. They fall into the greatest migration distance category, and are represented arbitrarily in the figure by the 2 points showing the greatest migration distances.
