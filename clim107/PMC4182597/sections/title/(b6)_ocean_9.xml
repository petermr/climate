 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the primary mechanisms through which climate change could impact oceanic habitats is through acidification

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Flynn1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Flynn1">[80]</a>. This likely will reduce the quality of marine habitats, but the extent to which this might affect pelagic non–breeding shorebirds is uncertain

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Milligan1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Milligan1">[82]</a>. One hypothesis is that ocean acidification could reduce the fitness of many plankton species by reducing calcification and other physiological processes

  <a rid="pone.0108899-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0108899-Taylor1">[84]</a>. If ocean acidification does negatively impact marine plankton food resources, the decrease could be offset, however, by increased ocean upwelling which could function to increase food resources
