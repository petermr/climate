 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mechanistic models of tick abundance, population dynamics, phenology and distributions</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While mechanistic models have the advantage of being able to project biological mechanisms, as opposed to associations, forward in time, the sheer numbers of both climatic parameters and tick-demographic and behavioural response variables pose enormous challenges to the constructing and understanding mechanistic models. Most mechanistic models, therefore, embody one or a few relationships that are thought to be dominant. The approach by Ogden 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C53">53</a>], using the average number of degree days greater than 0°C to describe present and project future habitat suitability with climate warming, has been very influential (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C84" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C84">84</a>]). The authors built their model around the relationships between the key developmental rates (e.g. moulting, eclosion) and temperatures that they had observed in the field for 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> near the northern extent of their North American distribution [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C26" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C26">26</a>]. Because of data limitations they tuned many parameter values, including those determining density-dependence and on-host mortality, to reproduce observed patterns. Their simulation model, which included 48 parameters for tick vital rates and two parameters for host-finding, was reasonably successful in mimicking natural patterns of population dynamics for all three blood-feeding stages [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C53">53</a>]. Not surprisingly given its underlying assumptions, this model and several follow-up studies [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C54">54</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C85">85</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C86" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C86">86</a>] suggested that the average number of degree days greater than 0°C was the key climatic parameter limiting tick distribution; that vast areas outside the current distribution of 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> were suitable and that the tick's geographical range would expand northward and westward well into Canada as the climate warms. However, the model results rest heavily on the assumption that off-host tick mortality rate is a time-constant variable, such that the number of ticks surviving decays exponentially with time in each developmental stage, a reasonable first approximation, but an important assumption that needs testing.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More recent models of the influence of climate on 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> in North America and 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> populations in Europe still embody the temperature-dependent development of ticks at their core [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C87">87</a>], but have begun to use matrix-modelling approaches, which offer the potential for more robust sensitivity analyses [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>]. Such sensitivity or elasticity analyses can help identify the parameters that most strongly influence tick population dynamics and are thus the most important to validate. However, these models, like any other, simply expose the consequences of the assumptions that they make [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C88" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C88">88</a>]. Wu 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>], for instance, essentially recreated the model of Ogden 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C53">53</a>] using a set of periodic differential equations. It is not surprising that they found that variation in summer temperatures and the specific temperature-dependent rates of development were key parameters. We are not aware of any study with mechanistic models that explicitly considers alternate assumptions or hypotheses (e.g. as alternative model formulations). While these complex mechanistic models can reproduce the general patterns of tick population dynamics, it is unclear which biological mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to do so, and which simply add degrees of freedom. In other words, these models might often make the ‘right’ predictions for the wrong reasons. We see the overparameterization of models as an important deficiency that needs to be addressed and encourage researchers to consider multiple competing hypotheses in their models.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a related vein, these complex models have rarely been rigorously statistically tested against empirical data. While these models can produce many response variables (e.g. the presence, peak or overall density and phenology of tick populations), model output does not necessarily match the available data (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C89" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C89">89</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C90" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C90">90</a>]). Indeed, finding 
  <span class="italic">any</span> data with which to test models properly has sometimes required a great deal of creativity [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C85">85</a>]. One common approach has been to compare the predicted and observed phenologies by gestalt [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C53">53</a>], correlations [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>] or ad hoc methods [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C85" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C85">85</a>], but what constitutes an adequate or good fit is subjective. Models are rarely challenged with independent datasets from other regions or times. Dobson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>] took the commendable step of challenging their model with data from two independent sites and found substantial deviations between their model's predictions and observed dynamics at these sites. Determining which parameter values needed to change to improve the model fit in each location proved enlightening [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>], but we again caution that with so many parameters to tweak, these insights should be viewed as hypotheses rather than fundamental lessons about tick biology. Even with data limitations, we suspect a great deal of rigour and clarity may be gained by incorporating model fitting and validation into formal statistical (i.e. likelihood or Bayesian) frameworks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, all these models continue to rely on few empirical data and best guesses about key parameters. For example, the effects of changing photoperiod and temperature on tick diapause and the dependence of tick feeding probability on host density and tick density are poorly known yet critical parameters affecting model results [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>–
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C87">87</a>]. The usefulness of these models, therefore, is likely to increase when field data linking specific abiotic variables to specific demographic and behavioural responses are available.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is noteworthy that despite their divergent approaches, both mechanistic and phenomenological models suggest dramatic range expansions of ticks and tick-borne disease as the climate warms. However, each modelling exercise has produced different maps based on different assumptions about the impacts of abiotic conditions on ticks and tick-borne pathogens. These inconsistencies, serious data limitations regarding the key tick-demographic and climatic processes, the limited ability to demonstrate situations in which climatic conditions are responsible for prohibiting tick-borne disease, and only limited incorporation of non-climatic processes, have weakened the application of this rich area of research to public health policy or actions.</p>
