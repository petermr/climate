 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A unified conceptual model linking climate change to tick-borne disease would be helpful in guiding better understanding (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20140051F1" href="#RSTB20140051F1">figure 1</a>). Guided by this conceptual model, future research could explore the specific, local abiotic variables affected by regional or global changes in climate; the impact of those abiotic variables on behavioural, developmental and demographic processes of ticks, and on the dynamics of tick-borne pathogens. An understanding of climatic impacts on the vector and pathogen will allow researchers to predict how risk of human exposure to these pathogens will change as the climate continues to change. And, finally, climate-driven changes in risk, together with changes in human behaviour, will allow epidemiological patterns to be forecast.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While it is clear that the developmental rates and timing of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> spp. are temperature-dependent, the consequences of earlier emergence and activity for the tick population dynamics and disease risk are not well understood [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C115" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C115">115</a>]. Most models that incorporate these temperature-dependent developmental rates have assumed constant mortality rates during development and questing [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C53" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C53">53</a>]. Thus, longer development and activity periods inevitably lead to reduced survival. While recent models by Dobson 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C30">30</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C87" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C87">87</a>] and Estrada-Pena 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C31">31</a>] incorporate more realistic controls on questing behaviour and, in the former, host contact rates, these are still founded on best guesses and scant relationships derived from little empirical evidence. Experimental studies of the effects of condition-dependent tick behaviour on population dynamics and host–vector–pathogen encounter rates are needed.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a need for theory and empirical studies of tick questing behaviour and particularly success in finding a host under various climatic conditions. To what degree are questing ticks limited by conditions (i.e. by time available to quest) versus by host density? Of course these are not independent—if hosts are abundant then even a small amount of time questing may suffice—but the precise relationship between these two aspects of host-finding is not clear, and may be critical [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C98" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C98">98</a>]. If, for instance, host density is more important than climatic constraints on questing success over a range of conditions, this would change the focus of discussion. Note, too, that the discussion so far assumes that host density and activity are not influenced by climatic conditions, but neither assumption is safe. In particular, it will be important to determine how host populations may change in distribution and abundance in a changing climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the long and complex life cycle of 
  <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> species, it is not surprising that ticks in different regions appear to be constrained by different climatic influences [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C32">32</a>]. Focusing on the relative influence of climate on development, questing and host encounters, and overwintering survival in different regions may prove fruitful. Models that embody alternative hypotheses also need to be compared in a robust statistical framework.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is also a need to better understand what controls the phenology of nymphal emergence and activity. (At least in North America, it appears that larval emergence is controlled by temperature-dependent rates of development.) If the emergence of nymphs is not strongly influenced by changing temperatures or has a different relationship with temperature than larvae, then there is potential for increasing or decreasing delays between larval and nymphal activity and therefore for selection favouring different strains of pathogens.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, experimental and modelling studies have demonstrated that climate variability in the form of daily temperature range can affect risk of disease transmission [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C118" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C118">118</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C119" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C119">119</a>]. In both cases, models suggest that incorporating daily temperature variation (as opposed to including only a daily mean temperature) when baseline conditions are cool would increase the probability of an outbreak. However, when baseline conditions are hot, including a daily temperature range is likely to reduce the chance of an outbreak. To date, studies of the effects of temperature variability on the dynamics of tick-borne disease appear to be lacking, but variability could be important nevertheless [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C58">58</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C120" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C120">120</a>]. Climate variability could affect tick survival, host-seeking patterns and phenology, as well as replication rates of tick-borne pathogens.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another major challenge in understanding the relative importance of directional climate change in dynamics of tick-borne disease is disentangling the climatic effects from temporal variability unrelated to climate change. Recent studies in other disease systems, such as cholera and malaria, have provided models in which causes of fluctuating disease risk from factors intrinsic to the parasites and hosts are distinguished from extrinsic factors such as warming trends [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C83" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C83">83</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C121" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C121">121</a>]. Similar approaches applied to long-term datasets on tick-borne disease could be illuminating. Data–model fusion approaches using hierarchical state–space structures also can be useful in integrating multiple data sources (e.g. entomological and epidemiological), spatial scales, and explicitly incorporate uncertainty in observations and latent processes [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C122" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C122">122</a>]. Such approaches have rarely been applied to tick-borne diseases under changing climate, but would greatly facilitate the objective comparison of alternative models (i.e. hypotheses) in a coherent framework.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To date, there has been little consideration of how environmental conditions such as temperature or temperature variation might influence the replication and persistence of pathogens (e.g. 
  <span class="italic">B. burgdorferi</span>) in the ticks themselves. Several studies have shown that replication rates of mosquito-borne pathogens increase with temperature (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C123" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C123">123</a>]), but we are aware of no studies addressing this issue for tick-borne pathogens. Alternatively, the immune responses of many invertebrates are temperature sensitive, so it is possible that ticks will be more likely to reduce pathogen densities or even clear their infections at warmer temperatures. In either case, environmental temperatures after the first blood meal have the potential to alter the effective transmission rate from hosts to ticks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lastly, efforts to predict the distribution and risk of tick-borne disease necessarily assume that whatever mechanisms control ticks and tick-borne disease currently will be at work in the future. In other words, there is an implicit assumption that ticks, their hosts and the pathogens they carry are not evolving rapidly relative to climate change. This assumption warrants further attention (e.g. [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C124" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C124">124</a>]).
