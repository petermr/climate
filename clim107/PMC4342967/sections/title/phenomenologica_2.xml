 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given these potential environmental controls on ticks and tick-borne disease, there have been many efforts to find the set of environmental factors that best explains the current distribution of ticks (or of tick-borne disease). Then, assuming that those conditions represent the full range of suitable habitat, projections of this set of conditions in the future are used to estimate the future distributions of ticks or disease. This approach is largely phenomenological, in that environmental factors are selected based on correlations between those factors and the presence (or less commonly, the abundance) of ticks or of tick-borne disease. In an important early example of this approach Brownstein 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C72">72</a>] modelled habitat suitability for 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> in the USA. The authors used a tick distribution map [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C73" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C73">73</a>] to discriminate locations with from those without 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span>. They used 16 climatic variables in a remote sensing dataset—the mean, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of four monthly ground temperatures—to create a climate envelope of suitability. The resulting habitat suitability map predicted modest westward expansion but little northern expansion of tick populations with climate change. In marked contrast, a climate envelope model of Lyme disease cases by Ashley &amp; Meentemeyer [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C74">74</a>], based only on spring temperature, precipitation and soil moisture, predicted that vast areas of the eastern and midwestern United States outside the current range were suitable for invasion by Lyme disease. As is often the case with such phenomenological models, however, the important predictor variables can be chosen arbitrarily and are often hard to interpret biologically. For example, the potential for winter, autumn and summer variables to delimit ticks and tick-borne disease was not considered by Ashley &amp; Meentemeyer [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C74" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C74">74</a>]. In the Brownstein 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C72" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C72">72</a>] study, the best predictor of tick habitat suitability was minimum winter temperature, but the relationship was a fourth-order polynomial that has no obvious biological interpretation. It is also far from clear if such statistical associations can be expected to hold in the future or even new datasets. Only recently have climatic variables been considered together with factors like habitat fragmentation and host abundances [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> in Europe, Estrada-Pena [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C77" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C77">77</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C78" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C78">78</a>] used remotely sensed data on mean monthly temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; an index of plant photosynthetic activity reflecting combined moisture and temperature) to generate a climate suitability envelope. This model was then used to hindcast changes in the distribution of suitable habitat between 2000 and 2010, showing spreading suitable conditions that roughly match apparent increases in tick distribution. Estrada-Pena 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C79">79</a>] suggest that continued climate warming will cause a continued range expansion for this tick and potentially the pathogens it transmits, reinforcing the predictions based on process models described in §§3 &amp; 4. Similarly, Porretta 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C80">80</a>] developed a MAXENT climate envelope model from over 4500 tick occurrence locations using 19 bioclimatic variables derived from monthly rainfall and temperature data. Their model predicted a massive spreading of habitat suitability throughout northern Europe and northwestern and northcentral Russia by 2050. Both the more severe greenhouse gas emission scenario (A2) and more modest (B2) scenario produced similar predicted spread, although the B2 scenario generally predicted greater habitat suitability within the range [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As pointed out by Estrada-Pena 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C79" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C79">79</a>], and Porretta 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C80" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C80">80</a>], such bioclimatic modelling results must be considered provisional because they incorporate only some of the variables known to affect ticks and tick-borne diseases. Without first establishing the mechanisms governing the effects of environmental variables on tick demography, the phenomenological approach risks basing models on spurious rather than causal relationships. In addition, the absence or rarity of ticks in certain regions could be caused by insufficient time for ticks to disperse from the established range rather than by unsuitable current conditions [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C21" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C21">21</a>,
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C22" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C22">22</a>]. In general, for species like 
  <span class="italic">I. scapularis</span> and 
  <span class="italic">I. ricinus</span> that are rapidly expanding their geographical range, the environmental conditions correlated with their distribution at any given time are necessarily a subset of all permissible conditions and thus must underestimate the range of conditions under which they can exist.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If temporal trends in Lyme disease incidence are correlated with temporal trends in climate, this would suggest that long-term climate change will cause directional changes in the public health burden of tick-borne disease. An early study of correlations between climate variables and Lyme disease cases was performed by Subak [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C81">81</a>], who collated the annual number of Lyme disease cases between 1993 and 2001 in seven states from the northeastern United States. Subak asked whether the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (PHDI, a measure of summer moisture) and the average winter temperatures in these states predicted Lyme disease incidence the following year or 2 years later. Although winter temperatures were poor predictors, PHDI 2 years previously correlated positively with Lyme disease incidence for four of the states, although a plausible mechanism was not provided [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C81" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C81">81</a>]. Analysing the same dataset, McCabe &amp; Bunnell [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C82" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C82">82</a>] concluded that Lyme disease cases in the northeastern United States were positively correlated with precipitation during May and June of the same year, but not with precipitation in any prior years. Perhaps because of these conflicting conclusions and the lack of a mechanistic understanding of processes that might underlie the correlations, not to mention the issues with identifying limiting conditions for a process that is generally increasing [
  <a rid="RSTB20140051C83" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSTB20140051C83">83</a>], researchers generally turned to constructing mechanistic models of tick population dynamics and climate envelope models of habitat suitability for the tick vectors.
