  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The different gaseous Nr species show the different increase rates during 2000–2005 in China, with 11.4%, 44.0% and 8.3% for N
   <sub>2</sub>O, NO
   <sub>x</sub> and NH
   <sub>3</sub>, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). The emission sectors of Nr also show large variations. N
   <sub>2</sub>O is the only form of Nr that has unambiguous global implications through the strong warming effect on climate (E1). Total anthropogenic N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions in China for 2005 were estimated at 1.04–1.22 Tg N. The primary source of N
   <sub>2</sub>O is agriculture. N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agricultural soils (including emissions from applied fertilizer, manure and crop residues) amounted to a total of 0.59–0.87 Tg N, it can be further categorized as either direct (0.40–0.59 Tg) or indirect (0.19–0.28 Tg) emissions. Direct emissions are caused by N applied to the soils, while indirect emissions are related to subsequent processes after Nr emissions and re-deposition, or after leaching and runoff. Animal manure, including emissions from manure management and grazing animals, contributed 0.17–0.18 Tg N to the atmosphere. The emission factors for direct and indirect N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture in China were 1.87% and 0.66%, a little higher than the global mean values of 1.48% and 0.42%, respectively
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. In addition, N
   <sub>2</sub>O from fuel combustion, industrial production, waste disposal and biomass burning delivered only 0.14–0.30 Tg N to the atmosphere. As a result, N
   <sub>2</sub>O exerts a strong warming effect at 345 ± 19 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis, then transforms to 311 ± 17 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). The close climate impacts on both timescales imply lasting effects on the climate system resulting from N
   <sub>2</sub>O due to its long atmospheric lifetime of around 120 years.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">NO
   <sub>x</sub> and NH
   <sub>3</sub> contribute to climate change indirectly through altering the atmospheric constituents and corresponding climate forcers. NO
   <sub>x</sub> is a major byproduct of combustion. Fuel combustion in China resulted in a total of 4.04–6.08 Tg N of NO
   <sub>x</sub> emissions in 2005, mainly from the combustion sectors of power plants (1.15–2.08 Tg N), transportation (1.26–1.66 Tg N), industry (1.35–1.79 Tg N) and household use (0.27–0.54 Tg N). Agricultural soils contribute a minor part with only 0.17 Tg NO
   <sub>x</sub>-N, mainly through microbial activity from agricultural soils. In sum, 4.34–6.24 Tg N is released to the atmosphere in the form of NO
   <sub>x</sub>. In comparison, the total emissions of NH
   <sub>3</sub> were 7.69–12.3 Tg N in 2005, becoming the largest source of atmospheric Nr in China. Agricultural soils (including volatilization and applied fertilizer and manure) and animal and human manure management are the main contributors, at 2.30–5.20 and 4.37–6.02 Tg N, respectively; other sources are negligible for the country as a whole. As a result, the combined climate impact of NO
   <sub>x</sub> on ozone and CH
   <sub>4</sub> (i.e. ozone-CH
   <sub>4</sub> effect, E2) in China is −350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a 20-y and 100-y basis, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). Our results show that the net cooling effect of NO
   <sub>x</sub> on ozone and CH
   <sub>4</sub> is notable only at a shorter time horizon, and gradually wears off with increasing time horizon. In addition, exposure to tropospheric ozone is known to inhibit photosynthesis, damage plants, and reduce plant primary productivity and land C sequestration capacity (E6)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. The reduction in C sequestration due to the ozone effect for China has been simulated by the terrestrial ecosystem model and estimated at 111 ± 100 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e under controlled simulations for different scenarios
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" href="#b24">24</a>. Therefore, the negative effects on the climate system and crop yields due to the indirect radiative forcing of ozone in China cannot be ignored. Both NO
   <sub>x</sub> and NH
   <sub>3</sub> can enhance the formation of light-scattering aerosols (E3). Compared with the NO
   <sub>x</sub> effect on the ozone-CH
   <sub>4</sub> effect (−350 ± 166 and −13.2 ± 7.2 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively), the direct aerosol effect of NO
   <sub>x</sub> is much less, with only −97 ± 39 and −0.006 ± 0.004 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively; while the corresponding NH
   <sub>3</sub> effects on aerosol are −59 ± 23 and −0.11 ± 0.13 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e, respectively. As the time horizon is extended, the direct aerosol effects of NO
   <sub>x</sub> and NH
   <sub>3</sub> both become smaller, and can be effectively ignored on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inputs of Nr into the terrestrial ecosystem are in the forms of N deposition and N fertilization. N addition into ecosystems can alter the physiology of soil microbes and vegetation, and concomitantly alter the balance of biogenic fluxes of GHGs
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. Our literature analysis results provide an explicit spatial map of N deposition over China (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). N deposition sums to 15.1 Tg N/yr across China, with 3.56, 5.28, 5.68 and 0.57 Tg N deposited into cropland, forest, grassland and wetland, respectively (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3b–e</a>). The estimated N deposition is closed to the published inventories of NO
   <sub>x</sub> and NH
   <sub>3</sub> emissions used in our study. Without considering the response of N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions mentioned above, N addition can stimulate terrestrial CO
   <sub>2</sub> assimilation in both natural vegetation and agricultural land; meanwhile, CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions caused by N simulation to some extent offset the benefit of N-induced CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake in terms of climate change
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>. These opposed impacts of Nr enrichment differ markedly depending on the land cover type
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" href="#b25">25</a>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" href="#b26">26</a>. The assessed N-induced CO
   <sub>2</sub> and CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission/uptake factors for different ecosystem types of China are summarized in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>. Our results show that in China forest land has the largest potential for CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake (−27 to −5 kg CO
   <sub>2</sub>-C/kg N), while cropland has the largest potential for CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions (0.01 to 0.03 kg CH
   <sub>4</sub>-C/kg N). Applying the flux factors of CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake and CH
   <sub>4</sub> emission by ecosystem types in China from 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a> to estimate the net C exchange (NCE) due to N deposition, the overall result indicates that the uptake of CO
   <sub>2</sub>-C (27 to 176 Tg C) overwhelmingly surpasses the CH
   <sub>4</sub>-C emissions (0.11 to 0.21 Tg C), resulting in an NCE of 27 to 176 Tg in terrestrial ecosystems during 2000–2005 (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S6</a>). Most regions in China's terrestrial system function as a net C sink; only a minor area in western China is an N-induced C source (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3f</a>). Our results further show that, during 2000–2005, forest land has the largest C sequestration potential, with 31.9 to 136 Tg C as a result of N deposition, followed by grassland (4.5 to 45 Tg N) and cropland (1.8 to 5.6 Tg N). For fertilized cropland, in addition to N deposition, applied N, including chemical and organic fertilizers, was evaluated at 35.7 Tg in 2005
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>, resulting in a net CO
   <sub>2</sub> uptake of 14 to 58 Tg C and CH
   <sub>4</sub> emissions of 0.40 to 1.06 Tg C. The NCE of croplands due to N fertilization amounts to 13.6 to 57.0 Tg C.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the whole, N addition has a positive effect on terrestrial C sequestration over the past several years. The C sequestration simulated by both N deposition and fertilization exerts a cooling effect, −50 ± 86 and −86 ± 51 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> and a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). The climate cooling effects of N-induced C sequestration, however, offset only 18% and 35% of the warming effects of N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions from agriculture in terms of GTP
   <sub>20</sub> and GTP
   <sub>100</sub>, respectively. Basically, taking the effects of these three GHG fluxes between air and land into account, Nr enrichment of the terrestrial ecosystem can be recognized as a strong warming agency.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Integrated climate change impact of Nr in China</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the national scale, anthropogenic Nr in China's ecosystem has a cooling effect on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis in theory (−100 ± 414 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) and a warming effect (322 ± 163 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) on a GTP

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S7</a>). However, the uncertainty of GTP
   <sub>20</sub> is so large that it is hard to conclude whether Nr causes cooling or warming in practice. The uncertainty is largely caused by the climate effects of atmospheric Nr. The collective climate-change impact of gaseous Nr emissions is cooling (in theory) at −50±328 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis but warming at 408±112 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively, while the climate-change impact of Nr addition into the terrestrial ecosystem is cooling at −50 ± 86 and −86 ± 51 Tg CO

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative contributions of agriculture and industry sectors are illustrated in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>. The overall impact of industrial Nr is cooling (−287 ± 306 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis but converts to warming (136 ± 107 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis. The reason is that the cooling effects are largely from the short-lived agency, i.e., NO
   <sub>x</sub> emissions from fuel combustion. The effect of agriculture Nr is dominated by the long-lived effect of N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions. As a result, agriculture shows a net warming effect and a minor difference at two timescales, at 187 ± 108 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis and 186 ± 56 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, respectively. The climate effects of Nr from agricultural and industrial sources cancel each other out on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis, but together contribute to warming effect on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Projection of Nr impact on climate</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the SRES I-Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, we assume that Nr emissions and Nr addition will keep the current annual rates of increase. In 2020 and 2050, Nr in China will produce a cooling effect at −314 and −725 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis and a warming effect at 528 and 939 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig. 6</a>, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1" href="#s1">Table S8</a>). The results indicate that the increase of Nr compounds without any measures will mitigate the climate change on a 20-y basis however aggravate the warming effect on a 100-y basis. On a 100-y basis, the cooling effect of N-induced C sequestration declines significantly, from 86.0 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2005 to 57.3 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2020, then approaches zero in 2050. By contrast, the impact of Nr emissions on climate change becomes more important, increasing from 408 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2005 to 585 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2020 and 939 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2050. The SRES II-improvement scenario is built on the assumption that the N use efficiency of cropland will increase by 20% in 2020 and another 20% in 2050. Compared to the BAU scenario, on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis, the improvement scenario enhances the net cooling effect with 41% and 38% for the years of 2020 and 2050, largely due to the agricultural N
   <sub>2</sub>O emissions reduction. The SRES III-abatement scenario is built on the assumption of total quantity control for NO
   <sub>x</sub> in 2020 and an improved NO
   <sub>x</sub> removal rate in 2050, respectively. On a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis, the abatement scenario reduces the net cooling effect by 95% and 139% compared to the BAU scenario, ultimately appearing as a net warming effect in 2050. The reduction in NO
   <sub>x</sub> emissions has a strong negative feedback on climate change in the short term, whereas the increase in N use efficiency represents a positive effect on the mitigation of climate warming. Improving agricultural N use efficiency (i.e. N
   <sub>2</sub>O reduction) is the most timely and effective measure for the mitigation of the climate impact of Nr in China. On a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, the improvement and abatement scenarios both reduce the warming effect by 28% and 14% in 2020, respectively; the reduction effects transfer to 35% and 31% in 2050. Hence, reductions in agricultural N
   <sub>2</sub>O and industrial NO
   <sub>x</sub> emissions have a comparatively large mitigation potential in the long term.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The detailed comparisons between SRES and RCP scenarios are showed in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f5" href="#f5">Fig. 5</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f6" href="#f6">Fig 6</a>. All RCP scenarios on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis show a net warming effect, in contrary to our improvement scenario. However, the advantage of our improvement scenario diminishes with time. On a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (379.4 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) nearly approaches that of the lowest RCP scenario (RCP2.6, 356.4 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e), or even in 2050 (613.6 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) surpasses that of the highest RCP scenario (RCP8.5, 499.6 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e). The warming effect of our abatement scenario on a GTP
   <sub>20</sub> basis is lower than that of the RCP8.5 in 2020 and 2050. However, on a GTP
   <sub>100</sub> basis, its warming effect in 2020 (452.3 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) and in 2050 (646.1 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e) become higher than that of RCP8.5 (423.5 and 499.6 Tg CO
   <sub>2</sub>e in 2020 and 2050, respectively). The comparison results between SRES and RCP indicate that, (i) our reported SRES scenarios reveal the obvious mitigation potential on climate change but only on a short timescale not on a long timescale. (ii) the objectives of our scenarios in 2020 (i.e. realizing the total quantity control for NO
   <sub>x</sub> and improving the N use efficiency with 20%) is well-targeted to the concentration levels of RCP. However, the objectives in 2050 are too cautious to meet the emission under the RCP scenarios. More aggressive target should be made for the year of 2050.
