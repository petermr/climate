 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mean forward and backward climatic velocities (3.58 and 3.52 km/year (SD 2.71 and 2.55 km/year) respectively) were an order of magnitude greater than mean forward and backward biotic velocities (0.433 and 0.480 km/year (SD 0.382 and 0.782 km/year), respectively for all species combined). Whereas mean forward biotic velocity for amphibian species (0.698 km/year (SD 0.710 km/year)) was greater than that for birds and mammals (0.427 and 0.343 km/year, (SD 0.392 and 0.320 km/year) respectively), the reverse was true of backward biotic velocity (0.170, 0.546, 0.495 km/year (SD 0.218, 0.961, and 0.764 km/year) for amphibian, bird, and mammal species, respectively). These standard deviations represent variation across space in mean velocities calculated on a per-cell basis.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the standard deviation of species-specific velocities was calculated for each cell and averaged across space, mean values were 0.877 and 1.55 km/year, respectively, for forward and backward biotic velocities. The standard deviation between mean biotic velocities for different GCMs was lower at 0.323 and 0.248 km/year, respectively, for forward and backward biotic velocities.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Distribution plots of variation across space (within climatic zones or latitudinal bands) in mean velocity values for taxa groups showed that hotspots of low and high velocity (as indicated by skewed or multimodal distributions) exist, especially at higher latitudes (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s003">S3</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s004">S4</a> Figs). Variation across taxa in species-specific mean velocities within geographic zones indicated that taxa inhabiting arid, cold, and polar zones were more diverse in their levels of relative vulnerability than were equatorial or temperate taxa (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s005">S5 Fig</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High climatic velocities were located in both flat and upper montane areas (where climate types are “pushed off” mountaintops), as well as in peninsulas and islands. While backward biotic velocities follow generally similar patterns, the distribution of forward biotic velocities diverged from these patterns, suggesting greater influence from biogeographic factors. Correlation between forward climatic and biotic velocity was thus lower than between backward velocities (Spearman rank correlation 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">s</span> = 0.523 vs. 0.619 for all species). Disappearing climates were poorly correlated with (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <span class="sup">s</span> = 0.184) and were more broadly distributed than areas of disappearing species, and were more prevalent in montane areas.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correlation between biotic and climatic velocity was greatest in equatorial regions (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s005">S5 Fig</a>). Both biotic and climatic velocities were greatest at equatorial latitudes (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g004">Fig 4</a> and 
  <a rid="pone.0140486.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" href="#pone.0140486.s003">S3 Fig</a>). Backward biotic velocity was high in both equatorial and polar regions. Forward and backward climatic velocity showed a similar pattern combining a peak in equatorial regions with moderately high velocities in north temperate and polar regions (
  <a rid="pone.0140486.g004" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0140486.g004">Fig 4</a>). Ecoregions showing high levels of both forward and backward velocity were concentrated in the northern Amazon Basin and Central America (

Equatorial protected areas were highly vulnerable from the perspective of both forward and backward biotic velocities as well as forward climatic velocity. North temperate protected areas showed greater threats from forward than backward velocity. Arctic (polar) protected areas showed a wide range of vulnerability to both climatic velocity and forward biotic velocity.
