 <div class="title">Distribution of values for forward (top row) and backward (bottom row) climatic and biotic velocity, grouped by latitudinal band.</div>
 <p>Values for biotic velocity were first averaged over all species for each cell, and then the spatial variation in per-cell mean values across each latitudinal band was depicted using a beanplot. Solid black lines show mean values.</p>
