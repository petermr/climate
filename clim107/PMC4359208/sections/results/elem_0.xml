  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses for the nine items that comprise the two 
   <span class="italic">trust</span> variables—trust in agricultural and environmentally oriented entities, respectively, as sources of information about climate change—varied substantially. Among the agricultural interests, the percentage of farmers who indicated at least some trust ranged from 40% for “farm groups” to 24% for “agribusiness companies” (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013916513503832" href="#table1-0013916513503832">Table 1</a>). Among environmentally oriented groups, “scientists” were the most trusted (42%) and the mainstream news media were the least trusted (9%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results for the 
   <span class="italic">climate change belief and attribution</span> variable revealed that most farmers (68%) believed that climate change is occurring (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916513503832" href="#table2-0013916513503832">Table 2</a>). Attribution of cause varies substantially, with just 10% believing climate change is mostly attributable to human activities. Slightly more than one third believed that it is caused by natural changes and human activities equally, and 23% believed it is mostly due to natural variation. Furthermore, a sizable proportion of farmers believed there is not enough evidence to determine if it is occurring (27%) or it is not happening at all (5%).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summary statistics for the four items that measure 
   <span class="italic">perceived risks</span> associated with climate change are presented in 
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916513503832" href="#table3-0013916513503832">Table 3</a>. The items that elicited the highest levels of agreement were concern about impact on the respondents’ own operations (46% agreement) and on Iowa agriculture in general (43%). Thirty-five percent of farmers indicated belief that extreme weather would become more common in the future. On the other hand, 33% agreed that climate change is not a big issue because human ingenuity will enable us to adapt to changes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results showed substantial levels of support for both 
   <span class="italic">adaptation</span>-related items. About two thirds of respondents agreed that farmers should take steps to protect their land, and 45% agreed that investment in agricultural drainage systems should be stepped up (
   <a ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916513503832" href="#table3-0013916513503832">Table 3</a>). Support for government actions to 
   <span class="italic">mitigate</span> climate change through GHG reduction was lower, with 33% of farmers in agreement with that statement.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The structural coefficients for Models 1 and 2 are presented on their respective paths in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916513503832" href="#fig1-0013916513503832">Figures 1</a> and 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916513503832" href="#fig2-0013916513503832">2</a>, respectively. The Tucker–Lewis goodness-of-fit index (TLI) measures the incremental improvement in a model’s fit to the observed covariance structure over a null model and typically ranges from 0 to 1 (
   <a rid="bibr68-0013916513503832" ref-type="bibr" href="#bibr68-0013916513503832">Tucker &amp; Lewis, 1973</a>). For the Bayesian analysis, the posterior mean TLI can be computed from samples of the posterior distribution. The TLI for Model 1 is 0.784, and the TLI for Model 2 is 0.783, suggesting adequate fits. The models show key similarities in the relationships among trust, climate change belief, and perceived risk. The correlation between the two trust constructs (0.46) is measured to control for generalized trust, or the degree to which individuals tend to trust others (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regression coefficients for climate change belief and attribution were significant. Trust in environmentally oriented interests is positively associated with belief, meaning that respondents who expressed trust in these groups as sources of information about climate change were more likely to believe that climate change is occurring and attributable to human sources. An opposite but somewhat weaker relationship was found between trust in agricultural interests and climate change belief. Respondents who expressed higher levels of trust in agricultural interests were relatively more likely to be uncertain or not believe that climate change is occurring. These structural coefficients support H1a and H1b.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, these mediated understandings of climate change had a direct effect on perceived risk. The significant and positive path coefficient between belief and perceived risk in both models indicates that farmers who believe climate change is occurring and associated with human activity expressed substantially higher levels of concern. These structural relationships between belief and perceived climate risk support H2.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In turn, beliefs about climate change and perceived risks were related to farmer support for adaptive actions. Model 1 incorporates support for adaptive action as a response variable, and models both direct and indirect effects of beliefs on support for adaptive action (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916513503832" href="#fig1-0013916513503832">Figure 1</a>). The coefficient for the path from perceived risk to support for adaptive action is positive and significant, indicating that individuals with higher than average levels of perceived risk tend to have higher levels of support for adaptation. Although smaller in magnitude, the coefficient measuring the direct effect of belief on support for adaptation is negative and significant. However, the paths from belief to perceived risk and from risk to adaptation are significant and positive. The total effect is positive, indicating a strong indirect effect on support for adaptation through perceived risk. In other words, farmers who had higher scores on the ordinal climate change belief scale 
   <span class="italic">and</span> perceived higher risks of negative impacts were more likely to endorse adaptive action. Overall, the model indicates that endorsement of adaptive action was associated primarily with higher levels of perceived risks. This result supports H3.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Belief, Perceived Risk, and Mitigation</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model 2’s response variable is support for government action to reduce GHG emissions (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0013916513503832" href="#fig2-0013916513503832">Figure 2</a>). The coefficient measuring the relationship between climate change belief and support for mitigation is positive and significant. This suggests that belief in climate change and attribution to human activities is associated with stronger support for government mitigation policy. On the other hand, the coefficient measuring the indirect effect through perceived risk is not significant.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The positive, direct effect of belief on support for mitigation indicates that farmers who believe that climate change is occurring tended to agree that public action on GHG reduction is appropriate, and those farmers who attribute climate change to human activity agree more strongly. These results support H4. Furthermore, the results suggest that trust in agricultural and environmentally oriented groups as sources of information about climate change have negative and positive indirect effects, respectively, on support for mitigation through climate change belief. The lack of significance for the path from perceived risk to mitigation suggests that risk perception does not mediate support for government action on GHGs.</p>
