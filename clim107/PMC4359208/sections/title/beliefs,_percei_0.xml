 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because there is a paucity of literature on farmers’ understandings of and response to climate change, we draw on the burgeoning body of research that examines the general public’s beliefs, attitudes, policy preferences, and behaviors associated with climate change to inform our analysis. Much of this research has built on the “values–beliefs–norms” (VBN) framework for analyzing relationships between environmental concerns and behavior (e.g.,

The model proposes a causal chain of several categories of variables that together explain a substantial amount of variance in environmentally significant behavior. Loosely described, the categories are personal values; beliefs, including environmental worldviews; understandings of the causes and consequences of environmental problems; personal capacity to address those problems; and personal norms or sense of moral obligation to take action (

We look to the VBN literature, particularly that which has focused on public response to climate change, as a reference and guide to the development of a conceptual framework specific to our research questions about the relationships between trust in agents of influence, beliefs about climate change, perceived risk, and support for adaptive and mitigative responses in agriculture.
