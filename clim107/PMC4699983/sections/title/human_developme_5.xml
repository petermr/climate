 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human development is a major threat to global biodiversity. Transformation of natural environments (e.g., tropical forests) into farming lands and urban settlements, introduction of invasive alien species, pollution of land, air and water, sustained over-exploration of natural resources, and unsustainable harvesting of wild plants and animals are among the main drivers of biodiversity loss (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucn.org/what/biodiversity/" id="intref0020" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.iucn.org/what/biodiversity/</span>). For example, across the tropics, between 1980 and 2000, more than 55% of new agricultural land (
  <a rid="fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) became available at the expense of intact forests (
  <a rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib39">Gibbs et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, using a global Earth-system model coupled with fine-scale habitat suitability models and parameterized according to four global scenarios of human development, 
  <a rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib103">Visconti et al. (2011)</a> identified future hotspots of terrestrial mammal loss worldwide, particularly in Africa and the Americas. It may be anticipated that the growing world human population and the consequently increasing demand for food will cause profound changes in terms of hydric resources, land cover, and global biodiversity in the coming years.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increased amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which is also intimately linked to human development (
  <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>), is among the man-made causes of climate change (
  <a rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib94">Shepherd, 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib69">Müller et al., 2013</a>). Since the Industrial Revolution, increased greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., combustion of fossil fuels for electricity and heat generation, transportation, and manufacturing, land use changes) have greatly contributed to the natural greenhouse gas effect (
  <a rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib62">Malhi et al., 2002</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many studies have recently investigated the effects of climate change on the Earth's biodiversity. The predicted impact of climate change on biodiversity may vary widely, depending on several variables (e.g., method of analysis, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered). In their review, 
  <a rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib6">Bellard et al. (2012)</a> came to the conclusion that “the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the Earth”. This has been just been confirmed (
  <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">Ceballos et al., 2015</a>) and the scenario is expected to be worse in the fore coming decades, not only due to climate changes and but also other factors such as deforestation (
  <a rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib97">Struebig et al., 2015</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One may prognosticate that human development and climate change will negatively affect biodiversity at local to global scales. Accordingly, there is now weighty evidence that decreases in biodiversity increase risk of transmission of different infectious diseases (
  <a rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib53">Keesing et al., 2010</a>, 
  <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">Cardinale et al., 2012</a>, 
  <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">Civitello et al., 2015</a>). 
  <a rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib108">Zargar et al. (2015)</a> highlighted that the biodiversity-disease relationship is a multifactorial process and suggested the use of a multidimensional approach, whereby the same disease system could be studied in different ecological zones. New databases (e.g., PREDICTS and BIOFRAG databases) are being made available and will be useful for future assessments on terrestrial biodiversity responses to human impacts (
  <a rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib48">Hudson et al., 2014</a>, 
  <a rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib80">Pfeifer et al., 2014</a>). These biodiversity databases will also be critical for future investigations on the relationship between biodiversity and tick-borne pathogen transmission risk.
