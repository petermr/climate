 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis consists of two steps. First, we used hierarchical multiple regression (OLS) with blockwise entry [
  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-14994">45</a>] to model perceptions of personal and household climate change health risk using the following sets of independent variables as predictors: climate beliefs, social vulnerability and health susceptibility, and exposure to risk from climate change impacts. Political ideology and a composite measure of general health risk perceptions are covariates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, we performed a logistic regression with the same control and predictor variables as in the hierarchical multiple regression in order to assess which factors best predict those 8.7% of respondents who say they do not know what their and their household’s health vulnerability is to climate change. Low understanding of climate risks, and corresponding risk perception, have been assumed among the most vulnerable populations of the United States. For example, “do not know” is a characteristic response of one of the Global Warming’s Six Americas audiences typified by low income and education levels, the “Disengaged,” to questions about the effects of climate change [
