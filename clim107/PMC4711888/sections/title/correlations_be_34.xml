 <div class="title">Correlations between (A) cumulative change in relative catch potential and latitude, and (B) change in species’ catch potential (%) and latitude.</div>
 <p>Materials include cumulative change in relative catch potential by domestic fishing area (Table A) and number of species (
  <span class="italic">n</span>) whose catch potential (%) is projected to increase, decrease, or remain neutral within First Nations’ respective domestic fishing areas (DFAs)(Table B). Projections represent the lower (RCP 2.6) and upper (RCP 8.5) scenarios of climate change.
