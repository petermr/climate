 <p>The U.S. National Climate Assessment concluded that climate change is harming the health of many Americans and identified people in some communities of color as particularly vulnerable to these effects. In Spring 2014, we surveyed members of the National Medical Association, a society of African American physicians who care for a disproportionate number of African American patients, to determine whether they were seeing the health effects of climate change in their practices; the response rate was 30% (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 284). Over 86% of respondents indicated that climate change was 
  <span class="italic">relevant to direct patient care</span>, and 61% that 
  <span class="italic">their own patients were already being harmed by climate change moderately</span> or 
  <span class="italic">a great deal</span>. The most commonly reported health effects were 
  <span class="italic">injuries from severe storms, floods, and wildfires (88%), increases in severity of chronic disease due to air pollution (88%), and allergic symptoms from prolonged exposure to plants or mold (80%)</span>. The majority of survey respondents support medical training, patient and public education regarding the impact of climate change on health, and advocacy by their professional society; nearly all respondents indicated that the US should invest in significant efforts to 
  <span class="italic">protect people from the health effects of climate change</span> (88%), and to 
  <span class="italic">reduce the potential impacts of climate change</span> (93%). These findings suggest that African American physicians are currently seeing the health impacts of climate change among their patients, and that they support a range of responses by the medical profession, and public policy makers, to prevent further harm.
