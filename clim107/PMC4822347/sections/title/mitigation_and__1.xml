 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To tackle climate change and its impact on health, two main strategies are proposed. First, mitigation or reducing the green house emissions and secondly, adaptation or enhancing the capacity to cope with health consequences resulting from climate change. While climate change mitigation is every one's responsibility but to do more lies on those countries which were responsible historically for green house gas (GHG) emissions, now referred to as “Climate Justice”. India is in the process of economic development and to do so, has no choice but to use coal as primary source of energy in order to lift the poor out of poverty. At the same time, it has committed to reduce its emission levels by 33-35 per cent (from the 2005 levels) by 2030
  <a rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref16">16</a>. It has also placed more emphasis on renewable energy such as solar, wind and hydropower, and nuclear power, which would constitute 40 per cent of its energy source by the target year of 2030. In addition, the citizens can contribute through lifestyle changes such as switching to efficient lighting, solar heating, and use of public transport. These mitigation efforts can also bring direct health co-benefits such as by reducing the risk of heart diseases and other non-communicable diseases.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation on the other hand requires efforts to prepare for, and minimize health burden of climate change. Health sector can take a lead in these efforts specifically to carry out a comprehensive assessments of climate risks and vulnerabilities, establish an integrated environmental and health surveillance, and ensure mechanisms for efficient delivery of health interventions. Health system should be made climate resilient and ready to be able to anticipate ill effects and remain ready and prepared for an effective response. The national programmes on diarrhoeal disease control, vector control, and zoonosis must be strengthened and capacity to respond to disasters and emergencies ramped up.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To formulate policies and plan interventions, evidence is needed on the extent and type of health effects and how different sectors could contribute. Here, the research has an important role to play. Some of the priority areas for research in climate change and health include quantifying health risks and assessing vulnerability of local populations; formulating adaptation strategies and identifying social, cultural and policy barriers to their implementation; identifying innovative ways to ensure access to vaccines, life saving medicines to those who need it the most; and finally, to assess the role of social structures, institutions, and behaviours in responding to climate change.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific data so generated can then be used to develop an evidence-based health and climate policy and a national multi-sectoral plan. This plan should include activities to be carried out by different sectors including health. To enlist their support, the awareness of the health impacts of climate variability and change needs to be raised among political, financial and community leaders, health practitioners, civil society, media and the general public.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, while climate change is now recognized as a major global challenge for the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century, and its health relationship widely accepted, the depth of engagement and implementation remains tenuous. As noted above, health impacts are potentially huge and threaten public health security. The recognition of health impacts by the global leaders is the first step which hopefully will lead to concrete actions at the ground level.
