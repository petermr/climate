 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 the public health system in China has improved due to all levels of governments’ increased investment in disease control and prevention. The health status of the Chinese people has also improved [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-11025">63</a>]. However, infectious diseases still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and this may be exacerbated by rapid urbanization and unprecedented impacts from climate change. Although infectious diseases in China have been significantly reduced over recent decades, China’s current capacity to manage emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks is facing formidable challenges. A timely, streamlined, well-funded and efficient disease reporting and surveillance system is essential to monitor the threat of potential epidemics, which may not only affect population health in China but may also have wider implications for global health. In order to deal with future infectious disease threats effectively and promptly, comprehensive prevention and response strategies, which integrate a variety of complementary actions and measures, are needed. More research about infectious diseases, urbanization, climate change, and changing demographics needs to be conducted to support efforts to build China’s capacity to control and prevent the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the future.
