 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The process of urbanization is of particular concern in modern China. China’s accelerated development during the last few decades has resulted in rapid urbanization with unprecedented large-scale population movement within the country. Reports have indicated 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas by the end of 2014, while the rate was only 26% in 1990 [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-12-11025">30</a>,
  <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-11025">31</a>]. Rapid urbanization has brought numerous benefits to the country and substantially improved Chinese people’s standard of living on the whole; public health, however, has not progressed to the same extent. This is especially the case for the migrant population, who have made considerable contributions to the country’s economic development and urbanization, but often have less benefits in terms of income, job security, training, education, and health care [
  <a rid="B32-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-12-11025">32</a>,
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-11025">33</a>,
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-11025">34</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At present, China is estimated to have a migrant population exceeding 221 million [
  <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-11025">35</a>]. The migrant population, often described as the “floating population”, largely consists of people originating from rural areas to urban areas in search of better economic and social opportunities. The “floating population” constitute a salient and disadvantaged group in China accounting for more than 10% of China’s total population [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-12-11025">24</a>]. The migrants are often poor and less educated than the general population in urban areas. They typically live in low quality housing with inadequate sanitation, and have limited access to local health services. The needs of the migrant population have not been taken into full consideration in health care policy-makers’ formulation of relevant policies and regulations, such as health insurance, occupational injury and infectious disease prevention strategies including immunization. Meanwhile, the “floating population” itself is reluctant to spend its already limited discretionary resources on health care. It comes as no surprise that the overall health status of rural-urban migrants is generally lower than that of local urban residents [
  <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-11025">33</a>]. In particular, migrants can be more susceptible to infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as well as vector/food-borne diseases, and are less likely to receive proper treatment or be cured of infectious diseases than local permanent residents [
  <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-11025">7</a>,
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-11025">34</a>]. Further, children of migrant parents are also shown to have poorer health, lower nutrient intakes and constrained access to education compared to children of local or permanent residents [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-11025">36</a>]. Additionally, vaccination coverage among migrant children is lower than the rates for children of local or permanent residents [
  <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-11025">36</a>]. These factors, in addition to the large size, high mobility and poorer health of the migrant population, have the potential to contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, adversely impacting on national health. Access to health care, insurance coverage, education and community support needs to be extended to the migrant population irrespective of residence and employment status.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rapid process of urbanization has also caused dramatic changes in natural landscapes in China. New buildings, houses, roads, changed river flows and reduced vegetation impact on local ecological systems [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-11025">37</a>], and consequently influence the transmission of infectious diseases [
  <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-11025">37</a>,
  <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-11025">38</a>]. Studies have found that urbanization can impact on vector/rodent-borne infections, as many highly adaptable species in urban areas are important reservoir hosts for vector-borne and rodent-borne pathogens [
  <a rid="B39-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-ijerph-12-11025">39</a>,
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-11025">40</a>]. Moreover, accumulated garbage and discarded materials in cities provide food and habitats for rodents and vectors. Where water supplies are inadequate it can be necessary to store water in containers which can become an ideal habitat for mosquito larvae. By contrast, during the rainy season poor drainage systems can also create breeding sites [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-11025">40</a>,
  <a rid="B41-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-ijerph-12-11025">41</a>]. These factors contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of vector/rodent-borne diseases, such as Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [
  <a rid="B40-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-ijerph-12-11025">40</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the process of urbanization continues to accelerate and cities expand in size, there can be negative impacts on public health. High-density living is associated with close contact between humans and increased risks of disease transmission. Additionally, there are higher risks of human-pathogen and human-vector interaction in crowded areas where environmental health and sanitation conditions are poor. The large numbers of migrant workers in the cities constitute a high-risk group who can be more susceptible to local disease agents yet lack health insurance and may delay seeking treatment, thereby increasing the risk of disease transmission to others. These issues see the health care needs in high-density urban areas exceeding current resources. Forward planning needs to consider the implication of urbanization on disease prevention and control in China’s rapidly growing mega-cities.</p>
