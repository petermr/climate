  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>) were collected at the weather station of Eelde, approximately 7 km from the aviaries (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.knmi.nl/klimatologie/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.knmi.nl/klimatologie/</span>), where temperature was recorded 1.5 m above ground, every hour with accuracy of 0.1 °C. DTR is the difference between maximum (MaxT) and minimum (MinT) temperature within one day. Both MinT and DTR measured at the weather station correlate well with the measurements at the aviaries (N = 1196, r = 0.96 and 0.83 for MinT and DTR respectively;

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apparent effects of DTR on mortality could instead be caused by minimum or maximum temperature, because DTR will be higher when either minimum or maximum temperature has an extreme value. To resolve this issue, we included MinT as a covariate in addition to DTR in all analyses and also tested the interaction between MinT and DTR. Alternatively, we could have included MaxT instead of MinT. However, DTR = MaxT – MinT, and thus when MinT and DTR are given the corresponding MaxT is known. Hence having DTR in the model with either MinT or MaxT is mathematically equivalent. To confirm this point we reran the best fitting model in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t1" href="#t1">Table 1</a> with MaxT instead of MinT which as expected confirmed the importance of DTR on mortality.
