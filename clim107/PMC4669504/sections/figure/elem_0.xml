Blue (green) boundaries show RHBN (non-RHBN) watersheds selected. Light (deep) grey watersheds represent trends that are not (are) statistically significant. The magnitudes of trends are presented in terms of circle sizes, in which green (red) circles represent decreasing (increasing) trends. Maps in Fig. 1 were generated with licensed ArcGIS 10.2 using public domain geographic data of the Atlas of Canada 1,000,000 National Frameworks Data (
