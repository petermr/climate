 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the month of watering, water content decreased in controls, showed little change in low water treatments, and increased in both average and high water treatments. At 45cm, the average initial water content was 0.037 ± 0.02 g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span>. After the month of watering, water content in the control exposed plot fell to 0.013 g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span> because of lack of rain and increase in air temperatures, and decreased slightly in low exposed and low shaded treatments, dropping to 0.030 and 0.028, g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span> respectively (

Differences in number of samples per treatment also reflect difficulties in sampling from some plots because of dry sand.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between the end of watering and the following month, water content remained the same in the low shaded treatment but decreased in all other plots to 0.021, 0.036, 0.030, 0.049, and 0.033 g g
  <span class="sup">-1</span> in the low exposed, average exposed, average shaded, high exposed, and high shaded plots, respectively. Samples from the control plots could not be collected in the month after water because the upper layers of sand down to 25 cm deep were dry and the hole collapsed. Digging deeper would have mixed the dry sand with the sand below, making it impossible to collect an uncontaminated sample. In month after water application ended, among plots that were shaded, the high water treatment plots still had sand with a water content that was nearly twice that in the plots without water. Among exposed plots, water content was twice as high in the high water treatment plot as in the low water treatment plot one month after water treatments stopped (
