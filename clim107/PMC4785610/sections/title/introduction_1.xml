 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ongoing climate change will affect marine ecosystems in a myriad of ways. Increasing atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration results in a lowering of ocean pH which may, amongst other effects, impair the viability of calcareous organisms (Doney 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0007">2012</a>). Warmer temperatures will tend to increase ocean stratification, restricting the supply of nutrients to photosynthetic organisms in the surface waters (Steinacher 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0024">2010</a>). Warmer waters will also reduce the solubility of oxygen and exchange of subsurface low oxygen waters with the atmosphere, potentially resulting in deoxygenation with subsequent negative effects on marine organisms (Vaquer‐Sunyer &amp; Duarte, 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0027">2008</a>). The synergistic effect of these changes is predicted to be an overall decrease in primary production (PP) over most of the global ocean, with the possible exception of the Arctic region (Bopp 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0003">2013</a>). In addition, in high latitudes the structure of the phytoplankton community is expected to shift away from dominance by large species to smaller pico‐ and nanoplankton as the subtropical gyres expand (Henson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0014">2013</a>). In turn, this reduction in large phytoplankton is predicted to result in a decrease in upper ocean carbon export (Doney 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0008">2014</a>) and hence a reduction in organic carbon sequestration.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Given the critical role that the ocean biosphere plays in regulating Earth's climate (Kwon 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0017">2009</a>) and in providing the primary protein source for ~15% of the world's population (FAO, 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0010">2012</a>), detecting the influence of climate change is clearly a high priority. Rapid detection of the effects of climate change assists in understanding the influence of anthropogenic forcing on the marine ecosystem, which permits more effective decision‐making regarding dependent socioeconomic systems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As part of the effort to observe and detect long‐term change, a network of open ocean observatories aims to provide long time series of biogeochemical data on both state and rate variables. Previous work has demonstrated that ~30–40 years of continuous data are needed to distinguish a climate change trend in chlorophyll concentration or PP from the background natural variability (Henson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0013">2010</a>). Metrics derived from chlorophyll data, for example bloom timing, are not able to reduce the 30–40 year timescale for trend detection (Henson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0014">2013</a>) and, in addition, gaps in the time series strongly impact the detection of trends (Beaulieu 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>., 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0002">2013</a>). Nevertheless, some of the longer‐running ocean time series stations are now nearing this predicted threshold for the climate change trend in chlorophyll or PP to become detectable. However, time series stations typically record a variety of parameters beyond chlorophyll or PP; as suggested by Henson 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0013">2010</a>) the climate change‐driven trend may be more rapidly detectable in other biogeochemical data, a hypothesis which has yet to be tested. Financial and logistical constraints limit the network of time series stations to a relatively small number, mostly close to land to allow regular servicing. As it is unfeasible to fill the ocean with observing stations, an additional important consideration is the size of their ‘footprint’ – or the extent to which a station is representative of a larger region. Large data‐poor regions of the ocean may compromise our ability to detect long‐term trends on large scales. In this study we aim to assess when and where climate change may be detectable with the current monitoring network of open ocean observatories.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These issues are central to several of the ‘10 Commandments’ of climate monitoring, as defined in Karl 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. (
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0015">1995</a>). In particular, there is a need to determine the spatial and temporal resolution of data required to detect climate trends. This will then allow a framework for prioritizing the establishment of new sites in regions that are data‐poor or sensitive to change, and for providing justification for maintaining operation of well‐established time series stations (Henson, 
  <a rid="gcb13152-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" href="#gcb13152-bib-0012">2014</a>). In the analysis presented here we provide quantitative information on both the time and space scales needed for observing climate change effects on a range of ocean biogeochemical variables, which establishes a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current ocean observatory network for climate monitoring.
