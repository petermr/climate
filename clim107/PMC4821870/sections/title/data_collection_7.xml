 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After obtaining written informed consent, information was collected using a pretested, structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the investigators and finalized after pretesting in a similar rural setting outside the study area. A week-long training was provided to the interview team prior to data collection. The trained 28 interviewers collected data through door-to-door visits at household level under the direct supervision of 14 field supervisors. The interviewers and supervisors had completed bachelor degrees and had experience in conducting national-level surveys using the census method. The quality control team formed by the investigators monitored the performance of field members through regular observation at the household level and regular checks of data for completeness. In 5% of study participants (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=336), the quality control team independently repeated data collection. The investigators checked each questionnaire to ensure that no information was missing; any error detected was corrected immediately at the field.
