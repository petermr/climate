 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Health risk attributed to climate change is a multidimensional and cross-cutting issue (
  <a rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0002">2</a>). The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reinforced adaptation needs to protect human health from the adverse consequences of climate change (
  <a rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0003">3</a>). Community-based strategic interventions will be needed for health adaptation in developing countries such as Bangladesh over the coming years (
  <a rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0004">4</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0007">7</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, climate change and health related studies are mainly reported in developed countries and the number of studies in low-income countries are very limited (
  <a rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0008">8</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0014">14</a>). Since 2007, Bangladesh has topped the IPCC's risk index for climate change (
  <a rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0015">15</a>), which directly affects the lives and livelihoods of 36 million people in the southern coastal regions (
  <a rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0016">16</a>). Millions of people in Bangladesh suffer directly or indirectly from water and vector-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria, and dengue (
  <a rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0017">17</a>, 
  <a rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0018">18</a>). The actual health impacts of climate change are likely to be influenced by local environmental conditions, socioeconomic circumstances, and behavioural adaptations taken to reduce the full range of threats to health (
  <a rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0019">19</a>–
  <a rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0022">22</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The risk to human health in Bangladesh is one of the major risks arising from climate change. Incremental changes in average climate variables and climate variability – in particular, extreme weather events – affect disease outcomes. Due to climate change–induced differences in temperature and precipitation, the dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, and so on, will change (
  <a rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0023">23</a>). Meteorological factors are significantly associated with the risk of childhood diarrhoea in rural Bangladesh (
  <a rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0024">24</a>). The health sector must have evidence-based strategies for adaptation to new patterns of infectious disease under climate change (
  <a rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0025">25</a>). Therefore, studies focused on climate change and its potential health effects are most warranted in Bangladesh. However, little work has been done to quantify the magnitude of climate change effect on health in Bangladesh. In a cross-sectional study from two villages, one from the northern and another from the southern part of Bangladesh, households’ (
  <span class="italic">n</span>=450) perception and human health risks were explored, which warrants further research with a larger sample size for generalization (
  <a rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" href="#CIT0026">26</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the absence of valid surveillance data, a prospective cohort study is suitable to determine the changing disease patterns and the increased risk of certain diseases due to climate change. Hence, it may take a longer time to establish an association between increased risk of specific diseases and climate change. We conducted this cross-sectional survey as the basis of a future cohort study.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The survey was jointly conducted by the Climate Change and Health Promotion Unit (CCHPU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Bangladesh, and the Health Communication Network and the University of Newcastle, Australia. The objective of this study was to collect information on vulnerable peoples’ experience regarding potential influence of climate change and effect of extreme weather events on health, the magnitude of climate-sensitive diseases, and scenarios of the impact of climate variability and change on health system.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The health system of Bangladesh is publicly financed by a top-down approach from national to community level. There is no health insurance or community financing for health care expenditure. In most cases, the poor population pays out of pocket for their health care. This study also assessed availability and accessibility of health system at community level for adaptation. However, the knowledge and perception portion of the study has been submitted elsewhere.</p>
