 <div class="title">Projected Species Gains and Losses by LCC.</div>
 <p>Projected changes in the number of species occupying all the landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) in the US and Canada (except Hawaii). There are 36 sets of projections for each LCC (2 seasons × 2 responses (gains/losses) × 3 time periods (2020, 2050, 2080) × 3 climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, B2). Values represent the mean change (gain or loss) within each LCC.</p>
