 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We generated current species distributions by projecting modeled relationships across gridded annual bioclimatic data averaged from the same period used to construct the models. A spatial layer containing the median survey day was included as a constant in projections of BBS models and a layer containing the median number of survey hours was included as a constant in projections of CBC models. To characterize future climates and establish a spatial context for projections, we added future climate anomaly grids to baseline climate data in several processing steps. First, we obtained spatially downscaled (5-min resolution) climate grids for 13 combinations of general circulation models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref030">30</a>] summarized across each of three future time periods (2010–2039, 2040–2069, 2070–2099; hereafter 2020, 2050, 2080). We then subtracted contemporary WorldClim grids [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref031">31</a>] for monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation from the future grids to isolate predicted climate anomalies from baseline values. This resulted in a change value for each of the three variables between current and future for each month. Finally, we added these monthly anomaly grids to CFS mean climate grids for the base period (1971–2000) for each variable in each month, ensuring correspondence between the historical climate used to build the models and simulated future climate [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref032">32</a>]. We then transformed projected temperature and precipitation data into bioclimatic variables using DIVA software and the raster package [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref033">33</a>] in the statistical software R.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Species distribution models were projected into each of 39 future climate surfaces (i.e., 13 combinations of emissions scenarios and GCMs in each of 3 future time periods). Because we were fundamentally interested in understanding responses of species to climate change across scenarios and time, we ensembled projections for multiple GCMs within each scenario and time period (consensus forecasting

  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref034">34</a>]). This process resulted in 9 future prediction grids for each species, one for each emissions scenario (SRES A2, A1B, B2) in each time period (2020, 2050, 2080) that described climatic suitability of the United States and Canada on a continuous scale from 0 (unsuitable) to 1 (highly suitable). When estimating range sizes, we delineated boundaries of species ranges using a threshold value based on the maximum Kappa statistic [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref035">35</a>]. The Kappa statistic measures the proportion of correctly predicted sites after the probability of chance agreement has been removed [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref036">36</a>]. We chose the maximum Kappa statistic because it provided us a conservative estimate of ranges compared to alternative thresholds, particularly for rare species. We used raster [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref033">33</a>] and dismo packages [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref037">37</a>] in R for all projections and raster manipulations.
