The central output is a variance components table that shows the proportion of variance attributable to each variable (note: the predictor variables have to be treated as random effects for this analysis). We used the lmer function, which is part of the lme4 package in R [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref042">42</a>] to run random-effects ANOVAs to ascertain the percent of variation in current geographic range that is explained by four covariates relevant to bird conservation: species, migratory strategy [
  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref043">43</a>], climate change scenario (SRES A2, A1B, B2), and habitat affinity (IUCN). This was done separately for both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We also ran the same analyses, using relative change in range size as the response variable. Finally, we repeated all four variance components analyses using Audubon’s habitat classifications to see if choice of habitat assignment scheme affected the results.

  <a rid="pone.0135350.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0135350.ref044">44</a>], to calculate binary Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (equivalent to 1—Sørensen similarity) for each grid cell. Dissimilarity was calculated for each season, comparing the present and 2080 (SRES A2). Dissimilarity results were then mapped to provide a community-level complement to estimates of species gains and losses derived from changes in individual species ranges.
