 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maple syrup production from sap goes back to the first nation peoples of north-eastern North-America [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref001">1</a>]. With time, the methods were modernized and maple syrup production is now an important economic activity for the region. Sugar maple (
  <span class="italic">Acer saccharum</span> Marsh.), a dominant species throughout north-eastern North-America, is the most-used species because of its high sugar sap content (2–3%) [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref002">2</a>]. In addition to sap sweetness, there is increasing interest in the chemical composition of maple syrup, particularly the phenolic compounds, because of their antioxidant, antiradical and antimutagenic properties [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref003">3</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The period of syrup production [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref004">4</a>] as well as the annual yield [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref005">5</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>] have been shown to depend on climatic conditions, and therefore vary between years and regions. Recently, sugar maple producers in the province of Québec (which is responsible for 75% of the world production) have expressed concerns about the high year to year variability in the timing of the season (Houle, unpublished data). Similarly, in a survey conducted among producers of Québec, Ontario, Atlantic Canada and northeastern USA, 73% mentioned that start of the season was showing increasing between years variability [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref007">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sap volume and sugar content are associated to climatic conditions that prevail during the production season, as well as in the months preceding it [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref008">8</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref011">11</a>]. Several processes are involved in initiating spring sap production, which is based on alternating positive and negative pressure in the trunk and branches which is favoured by freezing temperatures at night followed by above-zero temperatures during the day (freeze/thaw cycle) [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref008">8</a>,

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The physiological processes involved, as much for volume as for sugar content, can be related to a few determinant conditions. Some authors noted that the ideal climatic conditions for sap production are temperatures close to 0°C at night rising above 4°C during the day [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref011">11</a>,

  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref014">14</a>]. Others identified the maximum daily temperature [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref008">8</a>] or the difference between the minima and maxima as factor determining production [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref013">13</a>]. Climatic conditions in the months preceding sap production can also be determinant [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>]. Precipitation (snow or rain) between October and April (inclusively) are positively correlated to syrup production in the following spring [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref011">11</a>]. Cold winters are also positively correlated to yield because they are associated with increased sugar content in sap [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>]. Warm temperatures in April may abruptly halt production by favouring bud break and the proliferation of microorganisms in the tap [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of the close links between climate and maple syrup production, climatic change is likely to have a strong impact on the industry [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref004">4</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>]. Predicted climate change effects for north eastern North-America include an increase in annual temperature and precipitation which will be particularly strong during winter, as well as a reduction in the duration of the snow cover [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref015">15</a>]. Below freezing winter temperatures must last long enough for the tree to begin the dehardening process necessary for the beginning of sap production [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref016">16</a>]; should this period become too short, tree physiology and vigor could be affected which would reduce sap production. Although no significant trends are projected in the number of freeze/thaw cycles [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref015">15</a>], the period of the year where the frequency of those cycles is at its peak is expected to happen sooner in the season. The possible impacts of these changes on maple syrup production are many. Because of its dependence on freeze/thaw cycles, the production season should occur earlier in time [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref004">4</a>]. Duchesne et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>]suggested that the period of sugar maple production will have to be shifted 12 and 19 days earlier in 2050 and 2100 respectively, in order to capture the optimum climatic conditions necessary to maintain the syrup production at its current level.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paper aims at investigating the impact of climate change on the timing and duration of the sap season. To date, the temporal variability of syrup yield has been studied mainly on an annual basis [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref001">1</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref006">6</a>], or on finer temporal scales (days) but for only one specific site at a time for a one-year period [
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref011">11</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0144844.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0144844.ref013">13</a>]. As a result, models capable of taking into account the variability in fine temporal scales and regional differences in timing of the sap season are still lacking. Here, we use a weekly data set of maple syrup production from 121 sugar maple producers located in 11 regions of Québec for a period of 13 years along with climate data to build models of maple syrup production timing. These models are then used to make projections of the impact of climate change on the timing (beginning and end) of maple syrup production based on 77 climate change scenarios issued from global climate models. We hypothesize that the period of syrup production will occur sooner in spring and that it will become more variable between years.
