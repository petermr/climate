 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The earth’s surface has warmed by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the past 30 years, and this is estimated to increase further (between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees Celsius) this century [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>]. Climate change poses significant threats to human health [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>]. Anticipated impacts include 1) food shortages as a result of lower yields of crops and fisheries in some locations, 2) reduced access to clean water due to changing rainfall patterns, 3) increased incidence of malaria, dengue, influenza, heatstroke and other climate-sensitive diseases due to rising temperatures, and 4) injury, illness and death from weather-related disasters [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) due to their unique geophysical features and their social, economic and cultural characteristics [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>]. Life expectancies in the Pacific are generally low [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>] and, in many countries, have not improved significantly over the last 20 years [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. Most Pacific communities have a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and some also have a high burden from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and dengue fever [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. These challenges are compounded by widely dispersed populations, limited resources and fragmented health systems, which are highly reliant on development funding.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation activities involve putting in place measures that reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to climate change impacts [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. To provide an example, the changing climate may result in an increase in the incidence of dengue [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>-
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>]. Adaptations may include strengthening the resilience and capacity of ministries of health and environment, as well as the general community, in routine vector control to minimise the presence of potential mosquito breeding sites, disease surveillance systems to detect dengue outbreaks, and response mechanisms to help ensure dengue outbreaks are promptly brought under control to minimise morbidity, mortality and health system strain.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been a substantial increase over recent years in international development funding for adaptation activities in the health sector [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. While this is much needed, if it is not used according to principles of development effectiveness, it has the potential to produce a multitude of stand-alone climate change projects and programmes, thereby increasing fragmentation within the health sector and other sectors [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. Given the potential effects of climate change are multi-sectoral, adaptation to the threats of climate change should be implemented alike. In this paper, we discuss how climate change and health development activities in the Pacific can be delivered in an effective and efficient way to help ensure positive, sustainable outcomes.
