     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intermediate-hydroperiod wetlands tend to dry in late summer or early fall in years with low precipitation. During relatively wet years, they hold water year-round. Water levels fluctuate considerably during the summer.</td>
     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intermediate-hydroperiod wetlands support populations of fast-developing amphibians, invertebrates with resting egg stages that can survive desiccation, migratory birds, mesopredators, and wetland-obligate plants.</td>

     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perennial wetlands often support the greatest diversity and abundance of amphibians and invertebrates, including fast-developing species and those that require multiple years to complete larval development in high elevation environments, while lacking predators such as introduced fish that often reduce species diversity (Bahls 1992). Wetland-obligate plants, birds, and mesopredators, may also rely on perennial wetlands.</td>

     </td>
     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Permanent wetlands do not dry and lose a relatively small percentage of their volume even during unusually dry periods.</td>
     <td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Permanent wetlands support a broad range of mammals and birds, and can be used by the full suite of wetland-breeding amphibians and most invertebrates, though increased predation (by native and introduced predators) limits actual occupancy. Primary poductivity depends in part on the amount of shallow littoral habitat. Wetland macrophytes are common.</td>
