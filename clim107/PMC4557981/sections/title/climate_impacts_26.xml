 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our climate-change projections demonstrate that all four of the wetland types on which we focused (ephemeral, intermediate, perennial, and permanent wetlands) are likely to experience hydrologic changes in response to future climate. However, the intensity and duration of climate change effects will differ markedly among the four types. These changes are also likely to lead to transitions along the continuum of wetland types captured in our hydrologic classes. Specifically, some ephemeral wetlands may essentially disappear and more than half of currently ecologically productive intermediate montane wetlands are projected to become ephemeral wetlands by the 2080s, as more rapid recession rate and earlier drawdown cause wetlands to reach their bottom volume earlier, resulting in more frequent and longer dry seasons in summer. For some perennial wetlands (e.g. Washington sites), transitions from perennial to intermediate wetlands or even to ephemeral wetlands are also projected as wetland water levels drop under climate change. Driving these changes is the fact that most montane wetlands are located either in snow-dominated watersheds or mixed-rain-and-snow watersheds where snowmelt is a key water source in late spring and summer. Because a warmer climate is likely to cause less snow accumulation in winter and earlier snowmelt in spring, montane wetlands are particularly susceptible to climate change, especially in combination with projected drier summers [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison between wetlands in Washington and those in Oregon and California also shows that wetlands with seemingly similar hydrologic characteristics are likely to have different sensitivity to climate change depending on local conditions. For example, perennial wetlands in our focal sites in Willamette and Deschutes National Forests, Oregon are likely to be less sensitive to climate change in terms of minimum water level compared to those in Washington. For perennial wetlands in Oregon, simulated summer soil moisture in the VIC simulations was close to residual values nearly every year but the wetlands did not dry out (maintaining ~20% of their maximum depth) under the current climate. This behavior suggests that these wetlands are coupled to more extensive deep groundwater sources, not captured in the VIC simulations, than wetlands in Washington. For the climate-change scenarios, wetlands in Oregon and California are projected to have earlier drawdown and reach their minimum water level earlier, but without drying out. This supports the argument that wetlands connected to deeper groundwater sources are less vulnerable to increased frequency of drying when compared to surface water-fed wetlands [

However, because the VIC model does not include a deep groundwater component, more sophisticated modeling approaches (such as the use of fine scale groundwater models) may be required to fully capture these effects [
