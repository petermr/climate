 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To assess the fine-scale availability of ice for caribou, we generated 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones around each location and evaluated the proportion of ice and water surrounding each location using the Geospatial Modelling Environment software [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>]. These buffer zone sizes encompassed frequently reported zones of influence for 
  <span class="italic">Rangifer</span> (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>]). We then compared the composition of buffer zones using Welch 
  <span class="italic">t</span> tests for crossings on ice, in water, and detours separately. Similar results were obtained using the 1- and 2.5-km buffer zones; thus, we only discuss results obtained using the 1-km buffer zone.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the selection of ice and water by caribou, we performed a step selection function (SSF) using the 
  <span class="italic">survival</span> package in R [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. SSFs compare observed steps to random steps originating from the same location in a conditional regression framework [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. We chose this method because the availability of ice and water needed to be measured in areas immediately available to individuals [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. We paired observed steps to 10 random steps drawn from the frequency distributions of lengths and turning angles of each individual at each location frequency. Prior to estimating frequency distributions of step lengths, we removed the highest 5 % outlier distances to prevent generating overly long random steps [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]. The conditional regression evaluated the probability of observing a real step with varying proportions of ice and water along each step. Although many environmental variables other than water and ice availability drive fine-scale movements of ungulates [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], we refrained from complexifying models to specifically test our hypothesis that caribou avoided water and selected ice during step selection.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assessed the influence of water body type (natural lake, river, or hydroelectric reservoir) in a separate model, by testing the interaction between water body type and the proportion of both ice and water along each step. We used a model composed of interactions with a 3-level water body type factor, but simpler dichotomies (i.e., natural lakes and rivers vs. reservoirs, lakes and reservoirs vs. rivers) gave similar results and are not shown. We compared the goodness of fit of models using Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC
  <sub>c</sub> [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>]). To assess the fit of the most parsimonious SSF model, we ranked logit values predicted by the model for observed and control steps within each stratum (i.e., a stratum is one observed step and its 10 associated control steps) and performed a Spearman rank correlation between step ranks (i.e., 1–11, the latter rank having the highest logit) and the number of observed steps in each rank (see [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>]). We performed 
  <span class="italic">k</span>-fold cross validation using 80 % of strata as the training set and 20 % as the testing set, and report the average Spearman rank correlation (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To measure possible inter-annual trends in caribou behaviour, we developed annual SSF models composed of the same covariates as the most parsimonious model for the whole study period. Year could not be included as a single covariate in a global SSF model, because conditional regressions compare strata at the scale of a step (i.e., always intra-annual). We also grouped years based on ice availability, isolating years with a short ice-availability period from years with a long ice-availability period, and used this dichotomy to evaluate separate SSF models. Year 2014 was not included in these analyses because caribou monitoring ended in summer 2014, before the freezing of water bodies.</p>
