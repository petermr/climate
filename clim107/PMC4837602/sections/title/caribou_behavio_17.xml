 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the 181 individual-years monitored, 95 (52 individuals) used the vicinity (i.e., surfaces and 5-km buffer zones) of the largest water bodies in the study area. These individuals performed 179 ice crossings, 11 water crossings, and 129 detours. The longest crossing was recorded on reservoir Robert-Bourassa, when a caribou walked on ice for ~30 h over a &gt;60 km distance. The caribou with the longest swimming distance swam across Lake Bienville over a &gt;25 km distance. Based on MODIS maps, ice was completely unavailable during this crossing, which occurred on October 19
  <span class="sup">th</span> ˗ 21
  <span class="sup">st</span>, 2013. All water crossings occurred during the fall migration (i.e., between 16 September and 29 November), and most of them occurred on the northernmost lakes (i.e., Clearwater and Bienville). The frequency of water crossings did not change with time (
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 1.98, df = 5, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.22) or between years with early (2007–2008, and 2013) and late freezing (2009–2012; 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = −0.95, df = 3.59, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> = 0.40). During 5 of the 11 water crossings, caribou began crossing in water but eventually got out and went around instead (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). Many individuals made long “pauses” before or after crossing or circumventing water bodies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). No collared caribou died on or in the vicinity of water bodies during our study.

    <p>Examples of commonly observed caribou movements in the vicinity of large water bodies. Prolonged “pauses” on water body shores before or after crossings and detours are illustrated using red diamonds. Fast and directional movements on ice are illustrated using green arrows. Unsuccessful attempts at crossing open water lakes are illustrated using grey arrows. These movements were made by two migratory caribou from the Rivière-aux-Feuilles herd in the vicinity of Clearwater Lake between November 2010 and April 2014. Similar movements were observed on other water bodies at different dates by different individuals</p>
