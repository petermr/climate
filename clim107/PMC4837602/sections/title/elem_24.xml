 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movements of large herbivores are influenced by a suite of environmental and anthropogenic factors, including the type of substrate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], topography [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>], forage availability [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], and presence of human infrastructure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. More recently, the effects of broad-scale changes in climate on ungulate movements have also begun to be documented. For example, Stien et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] demonstrated that Svalbard reindeer (
  <span class="italic">R.t. platyrhynchus</span>) increased their displacement distances following rain-on-snow events, which are predicted to occur more frequently during warm winters. In Northern Québec, we revealed a link between caribou movements and inter-annual variations in ice availability. Caribou avoided water and selected ice in years with long and short ice-availability periods, respectively, suggesting that caribou were able to respond to ice availability and, indirectly, prevailing climatic conditions. Ice availability could thus be one of many drivers explaining the distribution of caribou following climate change. Predicting future migration routes of caribou, however, remains challenging [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other landscape features, notably anthropogenic disturbances, also have the potential to disrupt ungulate migrations [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. Berger [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>] observed that the ubiquity of human infrastructure like fences, highways, and oil drills forced pronghorn (
  <span class="italic">Antilocapra americana</span>) and mule deer (
  <span class="italic">Odocoileus hemionus</span>) of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Wyoming, USA) to migrate through relatively narrow bottlenecks surrounded by topographic and anthropogenic features. Although Northern Québec is much less disturbed than Wyoming [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>], the conservation of migratory caribou in Northern Québec is nonetheless believed to be constrained by increasing industrial development, human activities, and climate change [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. Hydroelectric infrastructures, roads, mines, and buildings already occur throughout the area, and industrial developments, notably mineral exploration and exploitation, are expected to accelerate in the near future [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" href="#CR62">62</a>]. Along the large hydroelectric reservoirs of La Grande River, the land migration routes of caribou are located on isthmuses between water bodies. Provided that caribou will have fewer opportunities to cross and will circumvent reservoirs more often during migrations, interactions between migratory caribou and humans are bound to increase. Future studies will need to tackle the hard task of differentiating the relative contributions of all factors involved in the spatial shifts of arctic herbivores following global changes in climate and land use.
