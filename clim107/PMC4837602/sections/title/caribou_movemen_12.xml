 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We discriminated movement segments (i.e., crossings and detours) using a minimum of three successive locations to allow the calculation of turning angles. We estimated turning angles (°) by measuring the angle between the first and second steps (i.e., steps are straight lines between successive locations) composing a segment. For segments longer than two steps, we calculated the mean turning angle across the whole segment. We also estimated the mean movement rate (m/h) across segments by averaging the Euclidian distance travelled between successive locations divided by the time the animal took to complete the step. Movement rates and turning angles were estimated using the

  <span class="italic">n</span> = 653 locations from 48 individuals), in water (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 139 locations, 9 individuals), and during detours (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 1 119 locations, 37 individuals) using linear mixed models with the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom in the 
  <span class="italic">lmerTest</span> package [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]. We used all movements made by caribou at similar dates (i.e., between 16 September and 19 May) elsewhere in the study area as controls (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 136 257 locations). We estimated models using individual × location frequency as a random effect. This was necessary to consider possible biases in the calculation of movement metrics across individuals having different location frequencies [
