 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By simulating advances in the average thawing date of the largest water bodies in the caribou range, we found that only 6 % (1/17) of ice crossings performed during the spring migration would not have been possible if water bodies had melted 10–15 days earlier (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). When we delayed the average freezing date to projected values for the 2041–2070 horizon (delays of 7.8–13.8 days), the proportion of impossible ice crossings during the fall migration reached 24–46 % (12 to 23/50, Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6b</a>). Thus, future changes in ice phenology caused by a warming Arctic could result in the loss of as much as 36 % of ice crossings during the thawing and freezing periods by 2070.

Ice crossings by migratory caribou were observed between 2007 and 2014, whereas changes in breakup or freeze dates (from 1 to 30 days) represent potential consequences of warming air temperatures in the Arctic during the next 25–50 years (2041–2070 horizon). Projections of future freeze and breakup dates are taken from (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on this result, we isolated all ice crossings performed by caribou during the first 15 days following freeze or preceding breakup and replaced them with detours (
  <span class="italic">n</span> = 17 instead of 24 because we excluded movements across rivers or leading to islands). We found that simulated detours were on average 2.6 times longer than their respective ice crossings (
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 4.7, df = 16, 
  <span class="italic">P</span> &lt; 0.01). Within this time frame, we found a ~28 % increase in the total distance travelled by caribou to circumvent water bodies. Specifically, the 27 detours and 23 ice crossings performed by caribou in the first 15 days preceding breakup or following freeze in 2007–2014 amounted to 888 km, whereas the 44 detours (including our 17 simulations) and 6 river/island crossings amounted to 1 133 km in the projected 2041–2070 conditions.
