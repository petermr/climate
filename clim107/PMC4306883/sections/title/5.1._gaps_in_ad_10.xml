 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The National Adaptation Policy Framework serves as Canada’s national adaptation strategy, and while an important development it does not have action points, lacks visibility and is not intended as an implementation framework, with implications for its potential role as a coherent adaptation strategy [
  <a rid="B90-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-ijerph-12-00623">90</a>,
  <a rid="B91-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-ijerph-12-00623">91</a>]. The Framework is very similar to Australia’s document “Adapting to Climate Change in Australia: An Australian Government Position Paper” which outlines the Australian’s government vision for, and role in, adaptation, including sub-national governments [
  <a rid="B92-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-ijerph-12-00623">92</a>]. National adaptation plans of other OECD countries such as Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom however, go further, detailing the government’s general adaptation approach, specific adaptation options, and which departments or levels of government are involved (often divided sectorally). It is noteworthy here that Canada’s jurisdictional structure is markedly different from that of many Western European countries, inhibiting federal jurisdiction to engage in top-down guidance. Nonetheless, commentary on Canada’s federal role in adaptation has emphasized the need for a cross-cutting adaptation plan or strategy that will coordinate and clarify jurisdictional and sectoral roles and responsibilities in climate adaptation [

  <a rid="B94-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijerph-12-00623">94</a>], with such frameworks also serving to institutionalize adaptation at sub-national scales [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Federal departments such as Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) have examined the risks posed by climate change to Canadians and have begun to examine opportunities for adaptation; these represent important developments, and Canada has been regarded as a leader in examining vulnerabilities in a health context [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-00623">63</a>]. Climate change has also received increased emphasis within Canada’s federal agencies responsible for health: since 2007, for example, both Health Canada’s Climate Change and Health Office and climate change and health activities within the Public Health Agency of Canada expanded their full-time staff. However, further coordination and prioritization of climate change at the national level will be beneficial to develop and promote comprehensive climate and health programming. To this end, the Canadian government received significant criticism for a lack of leadership on adaptation issues by the Canadian Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development [
  <a rid="B94-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-ijerph-12-00623">94</a>], and similarly for poor performance in climate change policy and mitigation more generally [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provinces and territories need vulnerability assessments to plan appropriate adaptation strategies [
  <a rid="B96-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-ijerph-12-00623">96</a>]. Currently only the governments of Northwest Territories and Nova Scotia have independently conducted vulnerability assessments available online targeted to their specific jurisdiction and health. Natural Resources Canada conducted a regional vulnerability assessment, but the scale, level of detail, links between health and climate change, and overall relevance for adaptation planning varies by chapter [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there is an increasing amount of scholarship examining the effect of climate change on some sub-populations believed to be highly sensitive to the effects of climate change (e.g., northern populations such as the Inuit) [

  <a rid="B97-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-ijerph-12-00623">97</a>]. Vancouver succeeds in both identifying vulnerable groups within its jurisdiction and implementing tailored adaptation initiatives, targeting low-income populations [
  <a rid="B98-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98-ijerph-12-00623">98</a>]. Health Canada also identifies the risks and challenges for low-income populations in its extreme heat events toolkit for public health and emergency management officials, but does not offer any further adaptive responses tailored to this population [
  <a rid="B66-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B66-ijerph-12-00623">66</a>]. No other jurisdictions consider low-income populations in adaptation initiatives reviewed here.
