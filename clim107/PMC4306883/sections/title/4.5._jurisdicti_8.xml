 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canadian federal action on health adaptation largely consists of setting the stage for sub-national adaptation through 
  <span class="italic">groundwork</span> capacity building and knowledge development. Meanwhile, local adaptation is operational, focusing on planning and changing practice and behavior “on the ground” (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Divergent jurisdictional strategies are important here, since an adaptation initiative successful at one scale may not be considered successful at another [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>]. Federal governments are best suited to intervene with public policy on issues affecting whole populations [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>]. Some Canadian federal initiatives address specifically Northern populations which fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government, as dictated by Canada’s Constitution [
  <a rid="B78-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-ijerph-12-00623">78</a>]. Sub-national governments meanwhile are often more flexible and can make and implement decisions more quickly [
  <a rid="B79-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-ijerph-12-00623">79</a>]. Municipal governments have impetus for adaptation, since the benefits of these adaptive actions benefit them directly, and as key actors in adaptation need climate resources and decision support [
  <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>]. Current health adaptation to climate change reflects the jurisdictional responsibilities for health mandated by Canada’s Constitution, and the federal government’s role in adaptation outlined in Canada’s Federal Adaptation Policy Framework [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite these trends and the need for support, the influence of higher-level governments on municipal adaptation planning and implementation is not clear based on the publically available information reviewed here. Local governments are not entirely autonomous actors in adaptation and can be assisted or constrained by higher-level governments [
  <a rid="B77-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-ijerph-12-00623">77</a>,
  <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>]. For example, changes in Chinese municipal government adaptation agendas are heavily influenced by national government incentives [
  <a rid="B81-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-ijerph-12-00623">81</a>]; in contrast, where federal climate change action is limited such as in the United States, local governments may have the opportunity to be more entrepreneurial, innovative and autonomous in their adaptation strategies [
  <a rid="B80-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-ijerph-12-00623">80</a>,
  <a rid="B82-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B82-ijerph-12-00623">82</a>]. Based on our review, large Canadian municipalities seem to follow the latter pattern, where some cities such as Toronto and Vancouver have committed to adaptation, while others including Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton and Calgary report doing little to nothing. Provincial adaptation also does not appear to exert a strong influence on municipal adaptation: Quebec is a leader in provincial adaptation, while Montreal, Quebec’s largest city, reported few health focused adaptations; British Columbia is a laggard among Canadian provinces, but its largest city Vancouver is progressing autonomously.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assigning responsibility to jurisdictions for managing the risks of climate change impacts and financing adaptation is a major challenge in such cross-jurisdictional issues [
  <a rid="B83-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-ijerph-12-00623">83</a>]. In contrast to the Canadian context where the responsibility for health and environment are primarily devolved to the provinces, the adaptation responsibilities of central government are clearer in other countries with different jurisdictional structures, such as Belgium and the United Kingdom [

  <a rid="B85-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B85-ijerph-12-00623">85</a>]. These issues of scale and allocation of resources are difficult to resolve in unchartered cross-jurisdictional waters, and have been identified as barriers to adaptation in the broader scholarship [
