 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The projected impacts of climate change on Canadians’ health are diverse, complex, and incompletely understood for some health outcomes (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-00623-f001" href="#ijerph-12-00623-f001">Figure 1</a>). For instance, research has yet to reach consensus on the potential effect of climate change on hurricanes [

  <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-00623">25</a>], severe thunderstorms, and the high winds and tornadoes associated with thunderstorms, all of which are climatic events pertinent to health in Canada [

  <a rid="B27-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-ijerph-12-00623">27</a>]. Studies project freezing rain events are likely to increase in some Canadian regions, and decrease or remain the same in others [

  <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-00623">29</a>]. The frequency and magnitude of floods have increased in the last century [
  <a rid="B30-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-12-00623">30</a>] and are projected to increase in the future in most—but not all—flood-risk areas [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 20th century the occurrence of cold nights, cold days and frost days decreased in Canada [
  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-00623">34</a>], along with the duration, frequency and intensity of cold spells [

  <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-00623">34</a>]. Likewise, extreme heat events are projected to increase in intensity, frequency and duration [

  <a rid="B37-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-ijerph-12-00623">37</a>]. The negative health effects of extreme heat events in Canada will be amplified by an aging population and the urban heat island effect, particularly in regions with high population density [

  <a rid="B38-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijerph-12-00623">38</a>]. Typically there are higher cold-related mortality rates in Canada, but climate change may shift the balance by increasing summer mortality rates while cold-related mortality remains constant or decrease [

  <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-00623">42</a>]. Each degree Celsius increase in temperature, for example, increases the effective UVR dose by about 2% [
  <a rid="B42-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-ijerph-12-00623">42</a>]. While some exposure to UVR is beneficial to health, overexposure can pose serious risks [

  <a rid="B45-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-ijerph-12-00623">45</a>]. Climate change is also expected to negatively affect air quality in urban areas by increasing production of summertime surface ozone and potentially also influencing particulate matter (PM) concentrations [
  <a rid="B46-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-12-00623">46</a>]. One study found the highest projected increases in ozone concentrations for Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg, as well as large increases in Alberta near the oil sands developments [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-00623">14</a>]. In Canada, PM impacts may increase or decrease with climate change, depending heavily on biogenic processes. Wildfires are currently responsible for one third of all PM emissions in Canada, and are increasing in frequency, duration and season length, contributing to heart and respiratory illnesses [

  <a rid="B49-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-ijerph-12-00623">49</a>]. Heavy precipitation events, projected to increase in many regions of North America, are strongly correlated to incidence of water-borne diseases [

  <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-00623">51</a>]. Similarly, outbreaks of West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquito vectors, have been linked to conditions of mild winters, prolonged droughts and heat waves, conditions which are more likely to occur with climate change [
  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-00623">52</a>]. The prevalence and range of other viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors currently found in the United States, such as St. Louis encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis, could also be modified by climate change [

This relates in part to the continued importance of subsistence harvesting to livelihoods, the prevalence of traditional food cultures, and dependence on the rapidly changing sea, lake, and river ice for transportation between communities and to hunting grounds. Socio-economic and health inequalities are also pronounced among northern Indigenous populations, and are expected to exacerbate the impacts of climate change [
