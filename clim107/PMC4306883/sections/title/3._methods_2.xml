 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employed systematic review methods to document and characterize adaptation initiatives being undertaken across Canada, with methods varying by, and adapted to, jurisdiction. The approach builds upon emerging research in the adaptation tracking field, which seeks to identify and characterize the current status of adaptation and measure progress over time [
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-12-00623">61</a>,
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-12-00623">62</a>]. To identify federal-level adaptation initiatives, we conducted a systematic web search, reviewed Canada’s sixth national communication (NC6) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and conducted snowball searching. We developed the following search string tailored for Google web searches: 
  <span class="italic">(“climate change” OR “global warming” OR “climatic change”) health (adaptation OR adaption OR ~adapting OR ~coping OR response OR ~responding) (Canada OR Canadian OR “gc.ca”).</span> We examined the first 30 search results, then examined every other result after the first 30 until we had reached 30 consecutive irrelevant results, adapted from Panic &amp; Ford [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-12-00623">63</a>]. To track provincial and territorial health adaptation we used keyword searches on their respective Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, and Climate Change Department (where applicable) websites. At the local level we searched for evidence of health adaptation in Canada’s six largest municipalities (population &gt;1 million inhabitants) and in each municipality’s encompassing regional health authority (or equivalent). Under Canada’s health care system regional health authorities are responsible for health care delivery at the sub-provincial or sub-territorial level. To track municipal and regional health authority adaptation initiatives we used keyword searches on their respective websites. We conducted searches in French in jurisdictions where relevant. We developed inclusion and exclusion criteria for health adaptation documents (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-00623-s002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-s002">Appendix B in the supplementary materials</a>). All documents included in our study are listed in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-00623-s002" href="#ijerph-12-00623-s002">Appendix C in the supplementary materials</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We documented details of discrete adaptation initiatives found in included documents, including year, implementing body, adaptation type, adaptation stage, health vulnerability addressed, completion status, and consideration of vulnerable groups. Adaptation type refers to the following six adaptation categories adapted from Biagini 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-12-00623">64</a>] (

  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-12-00623">65</a>], adaptation 
  <span class="italic">stage</span> refers to either: groundwork actions which build adaptive capacity, prepare the conditions for adaptation, or enable adaptation actions; or adaptation actions which indicate action has actually been taken to reduce a population’s health vulnerability or increase resilience. Groundwork actions can be further classified as information and vulnerability assessment adaptation types, while adaptation actions are warning and observing systems, and practice and behaviour initiatives. Capacity building and management, planning and policy adaptation types could be classified as either groundwork or adaptation actions, depending on the characteristics of the discrete initiative.

For documents to be included in our analysis, they had to be a governmental document or webpage and report planned, in progress or completed adaptation initiatives addressing the health impact of climate change on humans. We collected data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and performed descriptive statistics. To examine whether health adaptation is jurisdictionally patterned, we compared adaptation between jurisdictions. We also compared adaptation of municipalities and regional health authorities (or equivalent) in encompassing provinces to explore the effect of provincial and territorial adaptation on municipal adaptation. Based on the information available in academic literature and in the vulnerability assessments conducted by Health Canada and Natural Resources Canada [

  <a ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-12-00623" href="#sec2-ijerph-12-00623">Section 2</a>. As part of our analysis we then examined what percentage of the identified projected health risks are addressed by provinces and territoriesin their adaptation initiatives available online.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our ability to identify adaptation initiatives was limited by how and if they were reported, noting we only capture explicitly and publicly reported adaptations. This represents a proxy sample rather than an exhaustive list of all adaptation actions. Whether jurisdictions choose to recognize and report activities related to adaptation is significant in itself as a potential reflection of the extent to which adaptation action and recognition is prioritized.</p>
