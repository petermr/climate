 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common reed is not very abundant in the wetlands of the St. Lawrence River wetlands, but our model suggests that current climate conditions are already suitable for a considerable expansion of the species through sexual reproduction. Climate changes expected over the next 50 years may also exacerbate common reed expansion, particularly if combined with a water level drop, which will expose large bare areas suitable for seed germination. This expansion may be particularly noticeable in Lake St. Pierre, where existing common reed stands could increase their surface areas by a factor of 100, potentially creating the most extensive complex of reedbeds in North America, with over 13,000–16,000 ha. By comparison, the Delaware Bay is believed to currently have the largest reedbed complex in North America, covering a total of 2770 ha (Balletto et al. 
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">2005</a>). However, it is unlikely that all the common reed germination grounds predicted by the model will ultimately be invaded, because other invasive plants could also take advantage of low water levels to expand their populations, especially the reed canary grass and the flowering rush (

  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">1997</a>, 
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">2004</a>), which will compete with the common reed for space and resources (Vymazal and Krȍpfelová 
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">2005</a>). In the long term, however, even highly invasive species such as the reed canary grass will be outcompeted by the common reed (Březinová and Vymazal 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2014</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The haplotype M is present along the St. Lawrence River for nearly 100 years, but has only covered to date a small portion of the area suitable for its establishment and growth. A biological invasion is often an exponential process: it remains relatively dormant over time before taking hold (lag phase; Crooks 
  <a rid="b17" ref-type="bibr" href="#b17">2005</a>; Pyšek and Hulme 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2005</a>; Aikio et al. 
  <a rid="b1" ref-type="bibr" href="#b1">2010</a>; Larkin 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2012</a>). A plant invader may take up to 150 years before reaching its maximum distribution (Gassó et al. 
  <a rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" href="#b28">2010</a>). Furthermore, the common reed is an opportunistic species, often establishing itself in wetlands following natural and anthropogenic disturbances (Chambers et al. 
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">1999</a>; Silliman and Bertness 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2004</a>; King et al. 
  <a rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" href="#b42">2007</a>; Hershner and Havens 
  <a rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" href="#b33">2008</a>). In the absence of disturbance, the existing vegetation provides some resistance to the invasion through competition for space and light, extending the lag phase (Lavoie et al. 
  <a rid="b46" ref-type="bibr" href="#b46">2003</a>; Byun et al. 
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">2013</a>). Differences in common reed stand size between the Lake St. Pierre sector and the other sectors of the St. Lawrence River may be due to fewer anthropogenic disturbances in Lake St. Pierre wetlands. The size difference may also be explained by the fact that the Lake St. Louis, Boucherville Islands, and Contrecœur Islands sectors are located in the heart of the most highly invaded region of southern Québec (Montérégie); the Lake St. Pierre area is located just outside this region (Jodoin et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2008</a>). Consequently, the seed rain (propagule pressure; see Lockwood et al. 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2005</a>) is probably more important in the Montérégie region than in Lake St. Pierre.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Testing various combinations of parameters during the development of the model showed that a low water level at the beginning of the growing season is the best environmental predictor for the establishment of a new common reed stand through sexual reproduction. Including the type of wetland as additional parameter helped to improve the model performance, but this factor had much less influence than water level. Temperature has a definite impact on the duration of the growth season, but the interannual variability of areas with the potential for germination of the common reed seed (data not shown) was essentially tributary to variations in the river water level. Several studies showed that common reed seed germination occurs only in the presence of an exposed wetland substrate (Weisner and Ekstam 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">1993</a>; Weisner et al. 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">1993</a>; Coops and Van der Velde 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1995</a>; Baldwin et al. 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2010</a>). Other studies also showed that new common reed stands emerge close to large lakes and rivers, essentially during periods of low water levels (Whyte et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2008</a>; Tulbure and Johnston 
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">2010</a>; Wilcox 
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the assumptions of the model was that the common reed shares roughly the same ecological niche in its native and exotic range. This is important, because most of the current knowledge regarding the biology of the common reed essentially comes from the native range (Europe). Niche conservatism is highly controversial for invasive species, and there is much conflicting evidence (for a review, see Guisan et al. 
  <a rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" href="#b29">2014</a>). In a recent paper, Guo et al. (
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2013</a>) concluded that the niche of the exotic populations of the haplotype M of the common reed in eastern North America was shifted compared to the niche of the native populations. However, this study only compared temperature and precipitation envelopes associated with the distribution of the species. To what extent this conclusion also applies to germination and seedling survival requirements remains to be verified. We are nevertheless confident in our model given its good performance in the Boucherville Island sector. Indeed, the increased proportion of sites between 2010 and 2012 which fits model predictions, that is, sites identified by the model as suitable for seed germination and seedling survival and where reed stands were observed, confirms the accuracy of the model and the relevance of the selected parameters. In other words, failures of the model to correctly predict the presence or absence in the field probably reflect the early state of the invasion rather than a poor model performance.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another model of common reed expansion in a context of future climate change has recently been published for the Great Lakes coastal zone (Carlson Mazur et al. 
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">2014</a>). Results are difficult to compare, because the scale and methods are completely different, but this model also predicts a substantial increase (from 3600 to 13,000 km
  <span class="sup">2</span>) by 2050 of the area suitable for the common reed, in a scenario where winters will become warmer and wetter. Water level changes were not specifically addressed, but the model suggests that common reed stands will likely expand in areas with low bathymetric slope, areas presumably corresponding to the shallowest sectors of the lakes. In both models, climate change is not a prerequisite for common reed expansion, but will probably accelerate the invasion, especially given that the species readily acclimatizes to rising temperatures and higher CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels (Mozdzer and Megonigal 
  <a rid="b67" ref-type="bibr" href="#b67">2012</a>; Eller et al. 
  <a rid="b21" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21">2013</a>, 
  <a rid="b22" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22">2014</a>; Guo et al. 
  <a rid="b30" ref-type="bibr" href="#b30">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the model proposed in this article maps the sectors of the St. Lawrence River that are suitable for common reed establishment through sexual reproduction, under both current and future climates. It cannot, however, accurately predict when an invasion will occur or the speed at which it will progress. To do this, an algorithm for vegetative propagation would be necessary. It should also be noted that the climate change scenarios used in this article are among those presenting the greatest differences with the current climate (Morin et al. 
  <a rid="b65" ref-type="bibr" href="#b65">2009</a>). The resulting predictions are therefore particularly pessimistic. Notwithstanding, the common reed already has considerable room for expansion along the St. Lawrence River, regardless of climate change. Furthermore, hybridization (Paul et al. 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2010</a>; Saltonstall et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2014</a>) may accelerate the invasion as hybrids are often more invasive than their parents in human-altered environments (Schierenbeck and Ellstrand 
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">2009</a>), and there are many populations of the native haplotypes of the common reed in Québec (Lelong et al. 
  <a rid="b48" ref-type="bibr" href="#b48">2007</a>). Negative impacts documented in brackishwater marshes of the coastal Atlantic regions of the United States (Meyerson et al. 
  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2000</a>; Dibble et al. 
  <a rid="b19" ref-type="bibr" href="#b19">2013</a>) presage the loss of biodiversity awaiting the biologically rich St. Lawrence River wetlands (Centre Saint-Laurent 
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">1996</a>) as the common reed continues to expand.
