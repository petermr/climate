 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We combined the climatic factors affecting terrestrial ET into the three dominant environmental control factors; namely, demand, supply and energy. We quantified these three control factors by defining three dimensionless damping indices ranging from 0 (fully constrained) to 1 (no constraint) with decreasing constraints to ET. To calculate the demand multiplier, we first calculated annual PET (PET
  <sub>FixedSW</sub>) using the Penman equation driven by changing air temperatures and vapor pressure from NCEP2, with fixed daily shortwave radiation inputs from the fused SRB-CERES. We then calculated the multi-year average annual downward shortwave radiation (

  </div>) was scaled between 0 and 1, representing the tenth and ninetieth percentiles of the resulting variable distribution and is called the water supply multiplier. Higher and lower supply multiplier values indicate greater and lower potential moisture availability for ET, respectively. The ratio of all-sky to multi-year mean clear-sky downward shortwave radiation denotes the impacts of cloudiness and atmospheric constituents and the percentage of solar energy reaching the ground. This ratio was scaled between 0 and 1 according to the respective tenth and ninetieth percentiles of the resulting variable distribution and is defined as the energy multiplier.
