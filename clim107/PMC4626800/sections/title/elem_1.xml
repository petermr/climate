  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The remote-sensing-driven ET algorithm used in this study is called Process-based Land Surface Evapotranspiration/Heat Fluxes algorithm (P-LSH). P-LSH quantifies canopy transpiration using the Penman-Monteith (PM) approach coupled with biome-specific canopy conductance determined from NDVI, soil evaporation through a modified PM approach, and open water evaporation using the Penman equation. The core components of this algorithm (i.e., the baseline algorithm) are described in Zhang 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a>. In this study, we made the following improvements to the baseline algorithm to account for the influence of variable wind speed and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations on respective model aerodynamic conductance and canopy stomatal conductance terms, and resulting ET calculations: (1) quantify the impacts of increasing atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations on canopy stomatal conductance through a CO
   <sub>2</sub> constraint function used in the MOSES land surface scheme
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>, (2) use surface wind speed to calculate aerodynamic conductance following Monteith and Unsworth
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, and (3) replace the Priestley-Taylor method
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a> in the base algorithm with Penman equation
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a> to estimate open water evaporation and potential evaporation (PET) for considering the impacts of changes in surface wind speed on open water evaporation. More details on the improvements of this P-LSH algorithm are described in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Section 1</a>. Although the P-LSH algorithm do not explicitly account for the effects of local perturbations, such as land use and irrigation, on ET, which may influence local ET estimates, it at least takes these effects into account to some extent from the satellite-observed NDVI data. Besides the vegetation dynamics (V) quantified by the NDVI data, the other forcing data of this algorithm include air temperature (T) and vapor pressure (H), wind speed (W), surface radiation fluxes (R), and atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentration (C).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The global datasets used in this study include daily surface meteorology records, satellite remote sensing data for driving the ET and PET algorithms, and precipitation and discharge records for the water balance analyses and ET validation. Daily meteorological data were from the NCEP/DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (NCEP2)
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. We verified the quality of surface meteorological inputs against measurements from ground observation networks and through intercomparison with two other meteorological reanalyses, and confirmed a generally good quality in these forcings (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Section 4</a>). Remote sensing radiative flux data, including clear-sky incoming solar shortwave radiation, all-sky downward solar shortwave radiation, and all-sky net shortwave solar radiation, were from the NASA World Climate Research Programme/Global Energy and Water-Cycle Experiment (WCRP/GEWEX) Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Release-3.0 datasets (hereafter denoted as the SRB3.0) and the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) SYN1deg radiative fluxes. The SRB3.0 grid has a resolution of 1 degree latitude globally, and longitudinal resolution ranging from 1 degree in the tropics and subtropics to 120 degrees at the poles, while CERES SYN1deg has a resolution of 1° × 1°. We applied a statistical method to fuse the SRB3.0 data with CERES SYN1deg data by preserving the inter-annual variabilities and temporal trends of SRB3.0 on a grid cell-by-cell basis (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Section 5</a>). The other remote sensing inputs data include the 500-m MODIS-IGBP collection 5 global land cover classification

We applied the same fusion method for the radiation data to adjust the GIMMS3g and VIP records to match the MODIS record by preserving their inter-annual variabilities and temporal trends on a grid cell-by-cell basis (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Section 5</a>). The adjusted GIMMS3g and VIP records were combined with the MODIS record to produce a consistent long-term NDVI record as the input to derive biome-specific canopy conductance for our ET algorithm

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As deterministic models like the ET algorithm used in this study don’t have stochastic element and relevant replications, a common method to assess the average contribution of each input factor (main effect) to the response variable is to compare the difference of response variable between the simulation with only one varied factor and the control simulation

The control simulation (CONTROL) in this study is the simulation driven by the mean (i.e. the multi-year mean for individual day of the Julian days) environmental and vegetation conditions of the 1980’s (1982–1989). The ET result from the control simulation represents the expected value given the normal 1980’s environmental and vegetation conditions. For example, the main effects of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All temporal trends in this study were estimated using the Kendall-Theil robust line and tested by the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. Temporal anomalies were computed on a grid cell-by-cell basis and over the entire global domain relative to average conditions defined by the 32-year record. The null hypothesis of the trend testing is: there is no trend. The null hypothesis of the linear correlation testing is: there is no linear correlation between two variables. Statistical significance of the resulting trends was classified at α values of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01. If a 
   <span class="italic">P</span>-value is smaller than a given α, the null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level of α.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We combined the climatic factors affecting terrestrial ET into the three dominant environmental control factors; namely, demand, supply and energy. We quantified these three control factors by defining three dimensionless damping indices ranging from 0 (fully constrained) to 1 (no constraint) with decreasing constraints to ET. To calculate the demand multiplier, we first calculated annual PET (PET
   <sub>FixedSW</sub>) using the Penman equation driven by changing air temperatures and vapor pressure from NCEP2, with fixed daily shortwave radiation inputs from the fused SRB-CERES. We then calculated the multi-year average annual downward shortwave radiation (

Higher and lower supply multiplier values indicate greater and lower potential moisture availability for ET, respectively. The ratio of all-sky to multi-year mean clear-sky downward shortwave radiation denotes the impacts of cloudiness and atmospheric constituents and the percentage of solar energy reaching the ground. This ratio was scaled between 0 and 1 according to the respective tenth and ninetieth percentiles of the resulting variable distribution and is defined as the energy multiplier.
