 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Based on ambiguity of the term, some climate change adaptation practitioners have already moved beyond the use of “climate change resilience” (e.g., Stein et al. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" href="#CR200">2014</a>) and we similarly endorse a clearer more intuitive climate change adaptation lexicon for conservation areas that includes discernible management strategies (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). This range of adaptation strategies includes ‘persistence’ of current conditions, ‘directed change’ towards a specific desired new future, and ‘autonomous change’ in which a resource responds to change with no management response intended to drive the system towards a specific state. Appropriate adaptation options will vary over time, across space, and among resources. The intensity of management intervention required to achieve goals depends on the focal resource’s vulnerability to climate change within the management area and may change with management time horizons and rates of climate change.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inland fisheries management provides a useful illustration of this adaptation system. Under an ‘autonomous change’ strategy, managers would observe fish populations respond and self-organize as waters warm, and may manage other existing stressors (e.g., nonnative species) without intentionally directing the system towards a specific desired state. Some species will remain within the management area; others will migrate to more suitable locations or become extirpated, and yet other previously absent species that can reach the area will colonize this newly suitable habitat. In contrast, a goal to retain certain species would call for persistence strategies and trigger increased management intervention such as manipulating stream shading, reducing harvest, and/or increasing fish stocking levels. Under persistence strategies, as the climate continues to warm, management intensity needed to retain some historical species will increase and at some future point may exceed management capacity, or political will, and/or physical and ecological conditions may exceed species tolerances, at which point the strategy would no longer be viable. On the other end of the adaptation spectrum (‘directed change’), a goal of maintaining a recreational fishery regardless of species, for example, could prompt stocking of warm-adapted fish species (i.e., managed relocation). A major problem with the expanded resilience concept is that it now covers this entire climate adaptation spectrum, and thus is simply synonymous with the overarching concept of adaptation and therefore meaningless in communicating specific intent.</p>
