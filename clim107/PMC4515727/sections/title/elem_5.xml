However, there appears to be limited discussion of the relationship between drought and water-borne pathogens and the interactions between climate change and water-borne diseases are complex. In the U.S., the survival and multiplication of bacteria leading to leptospirosis outbreaks may have been altered by temperature and pH changes resulting from the stagnation associated with drought [

    <span class="italic">campylobacteriosis</span> (10,174 cases), followed by salmonellosis (6828 cases) and giardiasis (3862 cases). Other reportable diseases in this category have a far smaller number of cases, such as shigellosis with 1,068 reported cases and approximately 500 cases each of

In Prince Edward Island the growing reliance on irrigation in potato farming and requests for new deep well licenses created serious concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater supplies and whether or not a moratorium instituted over a decade earlier was still required [

In more arid regions where water supplies are finite, like the Okanagan region of southern British Columbia, water demands are managed through a combination of monitoring and management among users (e.g., managing water catchments, use of high elevation dams, reservoirs and instituting seasonal use restrictions). In Alberta’s Oldman Dam water shortages have even been managed using a system of “sharing the shortage” in which users agree to share the reduced allocation of water due to drought [
    <a rid="B292-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B292-ijerph-12-08359">292</a>]. In 2001, partial allotments of 60% were successfully used to ensure the delivery of water supplies to all licensees.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Water consumption can also be reduced by managing the timing of irrigation so that it targets the sensitive stages of crop development. In the case of corn, for example, yield losses may be reduced significantly by preventing water deficits at critical times in development; notably during the reproductive stages [

Even when plants are subjected to drought conditions, the timing and duration of the event must also be considered since plant processes can often recover following a period of drought if critical management actions are taken at the correct time (e.g., irrigation during flowering). Water conservation strategies and the timing and use of water (water management and irrigation timing) represent simple solutions that can be managed in response to need, when and where required (

The combined use of existing drought tolerant cultivars with physiologically sensitive timing of irrigation can serve to reduce water demands during key stages of development.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, drought resiliency in some rural and agricultural communities is related to proximity to urban centers. A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada [

Proximity to urban centers is thought to bring benefits related to off-farm incomes, access to technology (including computers/computing technologies), information networks (email, Internet) and access to agricultural institutions. Conversely, the lowest adaptive capacity was observed in areas more remote from urban centers, which were situated in more northern zones of this prairie belt. The importance of social networks and connectivity may be more obvious during periods of crisis, such as during the 2002 drought on the Prairies when farmers in eastern Canada who were less affected by drought shipped 64,000 bales of hay to western Canada through “Hay West” to support the worst struck areas [

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.15.1. Knowledge of Current and Future Drought Impacts on Health</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years information about the potential health impacts of drought has increased. Evidence pointing to health impacts that may be modified by climate change has continued to build since earlier reviews (e.g., by Smoyer-Tomic [
    <a rid="B51-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B51-ijerph-12-08359">51</a>] in 2004). The number of Canadian-U.S. studies is increasing, with more than half of the records for this region published after 2004. However, Canadian studies continue to be focused on the Prairies. In addition to studies situated within the Canadian context broadly, more than half of the records identified focused specifically on western Canada and all but one targeted the Prairies specifically. Research linking mental health impacts with wildfire and drought has also expanded significantly. However, research around drought and health remains narrow. Approximately three-quarters of the primary international studies identified were focused on mental health and nearly all focus on Australia. In the Canadian-U.S. literature, more than one-third of the primary studies are focused on mosquito-borne disease, largely WNV and the related SLE. This also appears to be the area of current interest, with these records accounting for more than half of the primary Canadian-U.S. studies published after 2004. Limited data on actual health outcomes results in uncertainty about the severity or magnitude of these impacts. Consequently projections of climate change effects on drought-related health impacts remain difficult to make especially in the Canadian context.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time that more evidence is needed to understand the impact of drought on health outcomes, public health is challenged by the uncertainty surrounding the probable occurrence of future drought in Canada. There has been limited research directed toward the probability and assessment of future droughts specifically over Canada in the context of climate change and variability. Greater certainty around the characteristics of drought anticipated in the future and their linkages with specific health impacts could help adaptation planners better identify and prepare for key risks in their regions, including those related to human health. For example, the literature reviewed in this paper suggests that certain features of drought (e.g., subsequent heavy rainfall events) may significantly increase risks of some infectious diseases among Canadians. Knowledge of geographic areas likely to be affected by drought, as well as potential changes to frequency, duration and severity of events is critical for the development of adaptation strategies which can directly or indirectly reduce health impacts. Coordinated drought research is limited and fragmented in Canada, often carried out only in response to severe drought experience. Although most regions of Canada have experienced drought, the majority of studies have focused on the Prairies due to the greater frequency of droughts in this region. The variety in the forms of drought experienced in Canada needs to be taken into consideration when planning for possible health impacts. Given the complex interactions with water, a discussion of the impact of drought on soil through the health lens may add to the literature on water and water content alone.</p>

Few adaptations are discussed specifically in the context of drought but are often put forward to address secondary concerns (e.g., vector-borne diseases).
