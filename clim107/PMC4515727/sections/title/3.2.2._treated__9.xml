  <a rid="B52-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-ijerph-12-08359">52</a>], which can increase turbidity leading to a greater potential risk of water contamination and consequently a greater need for water treatment [

In the event that well water becomes unavailable during drought, turning to alternative water sources can also increase risks to health if appropriate safeguards for those treatment measures are not in place [
  <a rid="B86-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B86-ijerph-12-08359">86</a>]. Inadequate water treatment is important as pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, are known to be taken up by particles in water [
  <a rid="B87-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-ijerph-12-08359">87</a>]. Costs also increase with the additional treatment required to address higher levels of turbidity [
