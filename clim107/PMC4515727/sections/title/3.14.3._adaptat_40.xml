  <a rid="B303-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B303-ijerph-12-08359">303</a>]. Although drought-related crop losses in the Prairies from 2002 were offset by farm insurance [
  <a rid="B174-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-ijerph-12-08359">174</a>], not all farmers are registered for insurance [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another key adaptation to variability has been to increase income from off-farm sources [
  <a rid="B174-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-ijerph-12-08359">174</a>] including from oil and gas leases [

  <a rid="B307-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B307-ijerph-12-08359">307</a>], but so can more external influences such as global scale changes in agricultural production, demand and markets [
  <a rid="B308-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B308-ijerph-12-08359">308</a>]. As such, the presence of well-developed social institutions and access to highly qualified personnel and information are particularly important for remote rural communities [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Canada, drought resiliency in some rural and agricultural communities is related to proximity to urban centers. A study by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada [
  <a rid="B309-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B309-ijerph-12-08359">309</a>] in a 550,000 square kilometer prairie region (comprising 53 Census Divisions across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) found that the areas exhibiting the highest adaptive capacity index values were clustered within corridors between major urban centers. Proximity to urban centers is thought to bring benefits related to off-farm incomes, access to technology (including computers/computing technologies), information networks (email, Internet) and access to agricultural institutions. Conversely, the lowest adaptive capacity was observed in areas more remote from urban centers, which were situated in more northern zones of this prairie belt. The importance of social networks and connectivity may be more obvious during periods of crisis, such as during the 2002 drought on the Prairies when farmers in eastern Canada who were less affected by drought shipped 64,000 bales of hay to western Canada through “Hay West” to support the worst struck areas [
  <a rid="B175-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-ijerph-12-08359">175</a>]. In 2012, some western Canadian farmers attempted to reciprocate with hay to eastern farmers [
  <a rid="B175-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-ijerph-12-08359">175</a>]. Adaptations to address the impact of drought on mental health and social capital within the community are also discussed above.
