 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognizes that climate change and the altered frequencies of associated extreme events such as drought and floods are expected to have negative impacts on human health [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-08359">1</a>]. For Canada, projections call for more frequent and severe extreme weather events including drought [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-08359">2</a>]. Research into the health impacts of drought and how climate change may enhance these effects is still in its infancy. A number of key health concerns related to climate change including food-, vector- and water-borne diseases may be exacerbated by drought. In addition, there is the potential for broad and lengthy exposure of Canadians to these episodes. There is particular concern about changes in the frequency, duration and severity of drought in the future due to climate change [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-08359">3</a>]. For these reasons, understanding of drought-related health risks is a climate change research priority. This paper reviews current understanding of the health impacts associated with drought that can be anticipated with climate change in the Canadian context drawing on Canadian, U.S. and international literature sources. It assesses the state of knowledge about adaptation options to protect health in the face of drought conditions and suggests future research directions to support adaptation efforts by health sector officials.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.1. Canadian Drought Features</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is currently no single, clear, consistent definition of drought. For the purposes of this discussion, drought will be considered a prolonged period of abnormally dry weather that depletes water resources for human and environmental needs [
   <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>,
   <a rid="B5-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-12-08359">5</a>]. Droughts stress water availability by lowering lake and reservoir levels, reducing stream flows, diminishing groundwater supplies and depleting soil moisture. Droughts can also create major environmental hazards such as reduced water quality, wetland loss, soil erosion and degradation, ecological habitat destruction and increased risk of wildfires. Prolonged, large-area droughts are one of Canada’s major natural disasters and can have large scale impacts on various sectors including human health and society, agriculture, forestry, industry, municipalities and recreation [
   <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>]. Droughts differ from other disasters (e.g., floods) since they have longer durations, lack easily identified onsets and terminations and their recurrence is practically certain in most environments including many regions of Canada [
   <a rid="B6-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B6-ijerph-12-08359">6</a>]. Climate anomalies, lasting from a month to one or more years, are the root of most droughts, although human impacts on resources and climate and the changing demand for water are major contributing factors [
   <a rid="B7-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-ijerph-12-08359">7</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is no one “straightforward” manifestation of drought. Each drought manifests itself differently depending on factors, such as area affected, duration, intensity and society’s capability to adapt to water shortages. Thus, although the general features of drought tend to be similar, the actual features vary between droughts and evolve within a single drought. This complexity may lead to varying impacts [
   <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-08359">8</a>,
   <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-08359">9</a>]. Some precipitation normally occurs even within a period of drought. It is not necessarily the case that the number of days with precipitation actually decreases during a drought; the relative lack of large precipitation events can for example be a contributor to drought formation. When it occurs during drought, precipitation tends to come in small amounts and to be highly scattered spatially due to convective processes, although more widespread rain can fall as well [
   <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-08359">9</a>]. Sometimes, droughts can even be linked with heavy precipitation events. This can occur when the atmospheric forcing that is causing reduced precipitation in one region results in nearby areas receiving more rain than usual. The boundary between these regions can shift, thereby creating a situation in which conditions in some locations can alternate between both extremes. In some cases, the “end” or significant reduction of a drought can come in the form of a single heavy precipitation event. For example dry conditions in 2002 across the Prairies were alleviated by a torrential multi-day event [
   <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-08359">10</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Surface air temperatures are often high/elevated during drought, although this is not always the case. For some long duration droughts, there are periods when temperatures are below normal [
   <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-08359">11</a>]. Droughts can also be windy or calm. Moderate to high winds can lead to erosion and transport of desiccated soil, although the number of these instances has generally declined, in part due to altered farming practices.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.2. Historical Occurrence of Canadian Droughts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Canada is considered a country with abundant water resources; however, these resources and the demands on them are distributed unevenly across the country [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>] resulting in varied vulnerability to, and impacts from, drought. For example, 98% of the Canadian population resides in the South, which only provides 38% of the water yield (Water yield is the volume of freshwater resources for a defined geographic area and time period. It is an estimate of the amount of renewable water and non-renewable glacial melt) [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>]. In the North, the per capita water yield is 98 times greater than in the South [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>]. The water yield in the Prairies is a fraction (3%–12%) of that in the Great Lakes, Maritime Coastal or Pacific Coastal drainage regions and decreased between 1971 and 2004 [
   <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-08359">12</a>].
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 20th century, meteorological measurements have shown significant warming during all seasons but the greatest rates have been during winter and spring. They have also revealed general increases in precipitation, although considerable decadal-scale variability is present over many regions of the country. For example, Zhang

   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-08359">13</a>] determined that mean annual air temperature has increased by an average of 0.9 °C over southern Canada between 1900 and 1998 with the greatest rates seen in the West during the winter and spring (southern Canada broadly refers to south of 60N; an exception is [

Subsequent analysis extending the target period to 2010 confirmed the warming has continued and even accelerated with an increase in the mean annual temperature of 1.5°C for southern Canada over this longer period [

   <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-08359">13</a>] also found that annual total precipitation increased significantly from 1990–1998 over most of southern Canada with the exception of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Analysis expanded to the period 1900 to 2009 also found an 8.7% increase in annual rainfall for southern Canada [
   <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-08359">17</a>]. Snowfall mainly increased in northern Canada while at the same time decreasing significantly in the Southwest for the period 1950–2009 [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An analysis of changes in extreme temperature indices over southern Canada from 1900–2003 and the entire country from 1950–2003 found that over most of the country, there was an increase in the number of warm days where the maximum temperature (&gt;90th percentile) and the number of warm summer days (maximum temperature &gt;25°C) during the last half century [
   <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-08359">18</a>]. The number of hot days (&gt;30°C) and summer warm days (&gt;90th percentile) also increased over all of Canada, but were only significant in southwestern regions [
   <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-08359">19</a>]. The analysis revealed little change in the number of summer warm spells. An examination of changes in extreme temperature and precipitation indices over southern Canada from 1900–2003 and the entire country from 1950–2003 found a decrease in the consecutive number of days with no measurable precipitation in British Columbia and Atlantic Canada. Trends in drought occurrence and severity in Canada are often monitored using meteorological drought indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [
   <a rid="B4-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B4-ijerph-12-08359">4</a>]. These indices are designed to assess regional precipitation anomalies (the SPI), or a region’s water balance using both precipitation and temperature data (PDSI and SPEI), to account for evapotranspiration effects. Results from trend investigations incorporating these various drought indices have shown variable results over Canada, often being dependent on the time period used in the trend calculation (mainly due to the aforementioned decadal-scale variability in precipitation). However, an increase in drought (i.e., a decreasing Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) trend) over most of the country was observed between 1950 and 2002 [

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Western Canada, notably the southern Canadian Prairies and interior valleys of British Columbia, are more susceptible to drought because they lie in the lee of major mountain ranges and, as a result, generally receive little precipitation but with high variability [

The Canadian Prairies have experienced large-area, multi-year dry episodes during the 1890s, 1930s, late 1950s/early 1960s, 1980s and more recently from 1999–2005 [

   <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-08359">23</a>]. Water levels of most closed-basin lakes have declined throughout the 20th century across southcentral Alberta and Saskatchewan in western Canada, although levels have increased in the past few years [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1.3. Future Droughts</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All Global Climate Models (GCMs) project future increases of summer continental interior drying and associated risk of droughts. The greater overall risk is ascribed to further increases in temperature and resultant potential evapotranspiration not being offset by precipitation increases [
   <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-08359">3</a>]. In fact, the recent Fifth Assessment Report from the IPCC [
   <a rid="B29-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-ijerph-12-08359">29</a>] stated that an increase in the intensity and duration of future droughts on a regional to global scale is likely (
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, “medium” confidence) by the end of the 21st century. This statement especially applies to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico, northeast Brazil, and southern Africa. Elsewhere there is overall “low” confidence because of inconsistent projections of drought changes (dependent both on the GCM model and dryness index). Definitional issues, lack of observational data, and the inability of models to include all the factors that influence droughts preclude stronger confidence than “medium” in drought projections (see [
   <a rid="B30-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-ijerph-12-08359">30</a>]).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some global studies have indicated that droughts will be slightly more frequent and longer in duration as compared to present-day conditions by the second half of the 21st century [
   <a rid="B31-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-ijerph-12-08359">31</a>,
   <a rid="B32-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-ijerph-12-08359">32</a>]. Specifically for North America, Trenberth [
   <a rid="B33-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-ijerph-12-08359">33</a>], using several GCM simulations, showed that future warming will increase both evaporation and surface drying, thereby leading to longer and more intense drought particularly in the summer over continental interior regions of the continent. A recent study found that the southwest and central plains regions in the continental U.S. will be significantly drier by the end of the century when compared with historical periods. This was the case even across various GCMs, and different metrics of soil moisture in both moderate and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios [
   <a rid="B34-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijerph-12-08359">34</a>]. 
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, future precipitation/water resource projections suggest that in Canada, the North will become wetter and the South drier especially in summer [
   <a rid="B35-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijerph-12-08359">35</a>]. However, limited research has been carried out regarding potential future drought occurrence across Canada and most investigations have focused on the particularly drought-prone Canadian Prairies. A first-order assessment of future drought occurrence over southern Canada (2041–2070) by Bonsal and Regier [
   <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-08359">14</a>] found future annual precipitation will increase over most of the southern region of Canada but this will be more than offset by increased temperatures that lead to higher evaporation so increases in drought are likely. The future mean PDSI estimates indicate the prevalence of more frequent drought for the southern half of the Canadian Prairies in the latter half of the 21stcentury with persistent negative PDSI values expected after 2040 [
   <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-08359">15</a>]. This suggests the possibility of a regime shift to a more arid climate in the southern Prairies due to the effects of projected summer temperature increases. Future projections of PDSI also revealed that multi-year droughts lasting 10 or more years are more likely than what has been historically observed. Projections suggest approximately three such events per 100 years as compared to the approximately once every 100 years that has been observed. Similar results for the southern Canadian Prairies were also documented by PaiMazumder 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B36-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-ijerph-12-08359">36</a>] using simulations from the Canadian Regional Climate Model for the period 2041–2070. Although published studies for the rest of Canada are limited, the authors noted that in more northern areas of the Prairies, drought events are projected to be less severe and less frequent. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to future precipitation events, particularly on a regional and intra-seasonal basis. Bonsal 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
   <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-08359" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-08359">15</a>] found considerable range in projections in their assessment of changes to the temporal and spatial characteristics of future (2011–2100) PDSI and SPI using statistically downscaled daily temperature and precipitation data over the southern Canadian Prairies, from three GCMs with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, although there are no comprehensive analyses of future drought events across all of Canada to provide detailed regional and seasonal drought information, both global investigations and a handful of studies conducted for the Canadian Prairies suggest that future droughts will likely increase, particularly in those regions that already experience these events (
   <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, more southern and interior areas of the country).
