In addition to its direct impact on human health, extreme heat can add to drought-related stress on agriculture with knock-on effects discussed below. For example, an extreme heat event that took place in Russia over July and August, 2010 reduced the country’s grain yield by 25%, resulting in increases in food prices and losses estimated at $15 billion [
