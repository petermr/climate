  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-21">21</a>
  </span> has been used widely around the world to help prioritize conservation efforts, particularly the location of protected areas 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-22">22</a>
  </span>. Most conservation planning has been based on “static” representations of biodiversity across a region, an approach that is clearly challenged by climate-driven changes in the distribution of species and communities 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-23">23</a>
  </span>. Consequently, substantial thought has been put into how best to incorporate climate change into the conservation-planning process.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cornerstone of initial approaches to integrate climate change into conservation planning was the use of correlative niche models to predict future distributions of species and ensure that these were adequately represented by present-day conservation efforts. The more sophisticated niche-based planning efforts included the ability of species to track changing habitat conditions through space and time

   <a rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-24">24</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-25">25</a>
  </span> and consideration of uncertainties in predicted distributions 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-26">26</a>, 
   <a rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-27">27</a>
  </span>. Climate, however, is only one of many factors determining the distributions of species, and the relationship is complex, uncertain, and in many cases evolving 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-28">28</a>
  </span>. The magnitude of these ecological uncertainties compounded by the uncertainties associated with climate predictions 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-29">29</a>
  </span> led to calls to integrate climate change into planning using approaches that were more robust to uncertainty in predicted climate impacts 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-30">30</a>– 
   <a rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-32">32</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An approach to planning that has gained some traction for conservation in a dynamic climate involves conserving the underlying geophysical variation in a region, also referred to as “conserving nature’s stage” 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-33">33</a>
  </span>. The rationale for this approach is that, theoretically, there should be a strong relationship between species distributions and geophysical settings (for example, elevation and geology) 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-34">34</a>
  </span> such that conserving representative examples of geophysical settings will protect representative ecological communities under both current and future climates 
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref-35">35</a>
  </span>. A similar approach that focuses on current and known patterns in a region emphasizes conserving connectivity between climatically diverse areas
