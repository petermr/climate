 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used simulations to demonstrate pika physiological activity constraints over a range of temperatures, elevations, and fur properties. The metabolic consequences of thermoregulation are reflected in the FMR/BMR ratio, which constrains animals at low and high temperature extremes. Pikas must maintain an FMR of at least 1.5 ×  BMR to remain active above the talus, but as low as possible above this threshold to conserve energy. While our summer‐month simulations produced FMR/BMR ratios no greater than 3.0, higher ratios could occur in winter when pikas face hypothermia.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrated that fur properties, molt timing, and animal size have significant metabolic impacts on pikas, thereby constraining activity time (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0007">7</a>). The role of fur properties in pika behavior, morphology, and physiology has, to date, been unexamined. To our knowledge, only three studies have documented pika fur properties. Krear (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0029">1965</a>) and Howell (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0022">1924</a>) documented two annual molts, noting that summer pelage is generally worn for &lt; 2 months and that winter fur is up to twice the length of summer fur, while Severaid (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0049">1955</a>) examined the effect of reproductive status on molt timing. However, the extent to which subpopulations inhabiting disparate climatic regions (or microclimates on the same mountain) vary in fur properties and molt timing is not well known. Our simulations suggested that plasticity in molt timing, to a certain degree, may reduce activity restrictions predicted under future warming scenarios. In particular, pikas that shed their winter pelage sooner could be less restricted in early growing season activity.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geographic variation in size and pelage can have substantial biophysical impacts on endotherms (Briscoe et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0010">2014</a>). Range‐wide variation in pika body size is poorly documented, yet we demonstrated that body size could affect potential activity time under climate change. Smith and Weston (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0055">1990</a>) reported interpopulation variation in pika mean body mass ranging from 121 to 176 g, but their sample was relatively limited in size and geographic extent. In addition to limiting activity (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0007">7</a>), animal size may interact with temperature to impact dispersal. Smith (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0052">1974</a>) suggested that pikas at low elevations were limited primarily by low colonization success associated with higher temperatures, and that furthermore these pikas were forced to disperse during the hottest times of the season. However, smaller dispersing juveniles (Millar and Tapper 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0035">1973</a>) can dissipate heat more efficiently and remain active at higher temperatures (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31848-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31848-fig-0007">7</a>). More range‐wide data on variation in fur properties, molt timing, and animal size, especially for at‐risk subpopulations, is critical to improve our understanding of pika thermoregulation and potential responses to future warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The nocturnal activity of pikas warrants further investigation, especially at warmer low‐elevation sites (e.g., Beever et al. 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0006">2008</a>). Little is known about nocturnal activity in pikas; nocturnal activity may be restricted to certain regions and subpopulations, or may be a behavioral adaptation available to all pikas. While several occurrences of nocturnal activity and vocalizations have been documented in the Sierra Nevada and GNP (Smith 
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0052">1974</a>; LMH 
  <span class="italic">pers. obs</span>.), Krear (
  <a rid="ece31848-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31848-bib-0029">1965</a>) observed no nocturnal activity during extensive observations in Colorado. The risk of depredation by efficient nocturnal predators such as owls and weasels could play a role in restricting pika nocturnal activity.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results presented here combine mechanistic biophysical and empirical correlative approaches to investigate the temperature‐limitations of American pikas. The approaches complemented one another, and together formed a more complete understanding of pika heat tolerance and thermoregulatory options. The empirical observations and correlative analyses provided critical support for the mechanistic model's predictions while also identifying important factors, in this case elevation, aspect, and possibly seasonality that were not modeled biophysically. In turn, the biophysical model provided mechanistic support for our understanding of the drivers of pika behaviors observed by us and other researchers. Future research could evaluate allowable activity time across the pika's range to model spatial patterns of occupancy and extirpation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Niche Mapper simulations allowed us to identify additional significant factors and generate hypotheses for investigation by future empirical studies. In the case of American pikas, the complex relationship between fur properties, body size, behavior, and microclimate structure may be critical to species persistence. For instance, we found that smaller pikas with shorter fur were better able to tolerate higher temperatures and remain active longer than larger pikas with thicker fur. Rising temperatures will present selective pressures on pika populations relative to the characteristics that we identified. Approaches that combine correlative and mechanistic analyses are becoming increasingly necessary in an age of rapid climate change.</p>
