 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 2100 warming scenario of +5°C resulted in restrictions in allowable activity time (diurnal + crepuscular hours) for simulated pikas in GNP, especially when pikas had a higher body mass and thicker fur. Simulations suggested that allowable activity time for a 120 g pika with summer fur in year 2100 will decline by 9.5%, but only in July and at a low elevation (1500 m). However, allowable activity time for a 150 g pika with summer fur declined by 10.5–23.8% in July and August at both 1500 m (Fig

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With winter fur, potential activity time for a 150 g pika declined under the future warming scenario at elevations below 2500 m. In June, when many pikas may still have winter fur, allowable activity time declined by 23.8% and 4.8% at 1500 m and 1750 m, respectively. Further investigation of the impacts of interactions between body size and fur properties on allowable activity for a pika at low elevation (1500 m) in GNP in year 2100 revealed no activity restrictions for a 120 g pika with 30% shorter and shallower fur (compared to the measured specimen), but 37% fewer activity hours for a 180 g pika with 20% longer and thicker fur (Fig.
