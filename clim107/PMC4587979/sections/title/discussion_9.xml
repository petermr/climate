 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Internet searches are one way of understanding the popularity of an idea or meme within the public at large. Within that frame of reference, the public looks at these two terms global warming and climate change and their awareness of the roles of the two phenomena [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref041" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref041">41</a>]. From 2004 to 2008, the search volumes for the term global warming far exceeded the term climate change. The range for the term global warming in Relative search volumes (RSV) was more than double that of climate change in this period (
  <a rid="pone.0138996.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138996.g001">Fig 1</a>). From 2008 on the RSV’s began to steadily decrease until in 2014 when the RSV’s for the term global warming were nearly identical to those for the term climate change. From 2008 there was an increase in the RSVs for CC until 2010 at which point the RSVs also began to decline for the term climate change. The decline in the term climate change for the most part paralleled that of the term global warming from 2010 on to the present.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While we are seeing the increases and decreases in RSVs for both the terms global warming and climate change, the most notable changes occur when the gap between the terms was the greatest, from 2008 through to 2010. During this period, there was a very large gap found between the RSVs for the terms global warming and climate change; however, searches for the term climate change was increasing while searches for the tem global warming were decreasing. The counter movement of the RSV’s for the two terms shows that there is a trend happening with respect to term recognition. At this point, there was an increase in the use of the CC term while there was a corresponding decrease in the use of the GW term. The change in the use of the term could have been due to changes in the publicity of the respective terms, since at this point, the CC term was being used more visibly in the media, and therefore the CC term was showing up in headlines and the press, resulting in a larger number of searches for the CC term. Correspondingly, the decrease in the use of the GW term is likely due to the changes in how the term was perceived by the public. The public press determines how a term is used, since they are the body that consistently utilizes a term throughout its visible life. The two terms, regardless of how they differ in meaning, are used with purpose in a scientific context, yet the public at large lacks this definition and therefore has no knowledge of the variations in the terms themselves [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref042" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref042">42</a>]. Therefore, when searching for a term, the public may very well, choose the search term that they are more comfortable with, resulting in a search bias, since they do not know the scientific use of the term.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The increase in the use of the CC term, could be a direct result of the release of the fourth assessment report for the IPCC in 2007 [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref043">43</a>]. The publicity related to the release of this document, which was preceded by the release of the Al Gore produced documentary “An Inconvenient Truth”, both of which were followed by the selection by the Nobel committee of Al Gore and the IPCC scientists for the Nobel Prize in 2007 [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref043">43</a>]. These three acts individually may not have created the increased media presence of the CC term; however, at the time the three events pushed the CC term and increased its exposure to the public which further drove the public to push for positive environmental change at the political level [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref044" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref044">44</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref045">45</a>]. This could very well have resulted in the increases in RSV’s for the CC term. This point is more likely to depict accurately the situation, since in 2010 the use of the two terms decline at almost the same rate, with nearly the same patterns.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus with respect to trend analysis, what is interesting is that RSVs are paralleling the press for specific environmental events that have predetermined value according to the press. The press in increasing the visibility of the term may drive the increases in the RSV’s for that term. Prior to 2007, the press was using the GW term indiscriminately whenever issues affecting the global climate arose; however, after the movie, the report and then the Nobel prize the terminology used by the press switched and the CC term became the word du jour. This increased the visibility of the word to the public, thereby it may be that increasing public awareness of the word, but not necessarily its import, is the source for the increases in RSV’s between 2008 and 2010.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The decline in the RSV’s then is a product of the lack of publicity about the issue. As the terms become more familiar, there would be less necessity to drive the term publicly into the spotlight; however, occasionally events/situations arise that refocus the issue creating a resurgence in the terms even though they have reached their peak visibility between 2008 and 2010.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since these terms have such an impact on the daily lives of the public via local regional national and global weather it is understandable that they have an emotional component to them [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref046" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref046">46</a>]. Every country has its jokes about the weather, where they come up with cliché’s about the weather (i.e. if you don’t like the weather wait 10minutes) that often show their discord and disjunction with natural climatological patterns [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref047">47</a>]. Furthermore, some sectors of society (farmers) have a direct relationship with the climate and their means of living; bad weather is equal to bad harvests, which means less money. To understand how society represents this love hate relationship with the weather, the twitter analysis was performed. Twitter, a data restricted social network system, has a limited character count to relay information about any topic the sender chooses to relate. These tweets can be used to assess the sentiment of the sender towards a certain topic. As stated previously, the sentiment is defined by the language of the tweet within the twitter system. Sentiment analysis showed that the two terms differed greatly. Based on the predefined algorithm for the sentiment analysis, certain language components carried a positive sentiment, while others carried a negative sentiment. Tweets about GW and CC were subdivided based on their positive, neutral and negative connotations within the tweet network. These emotions regardless of their character still play a role in how humans interacts with surroundings including other humans [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref048" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref048">48</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref049">49</a>] As seen in 
  <a rid="pone.0138996.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0138996.g002">Fig 2</a> the different terms had similar distributions, although with different ranges in the values. Global warming showed a much smaller positive tweet value than did climate change. Correspondent to this the respective percentage of positive sentiments for CC was more than double that of GW. Comparatively, the neutral percentiles were more similar for each term with a small difference. However, the negative sentiments for the two terms again showed a greater disparity, with negative statements about GW nearly double those of climate change.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These differences show that there is a perceptive difference in how the public relates to the two terms Global Warming and Climate Change [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref050">50</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref051" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref051">51</a>]. Climate change is shown in a more positive light than global warming simply based on the tweets produced by the public. The difference in how people perceive climate change and global warming is possibly due to the press, personal understanding of the terms, or level of education. While this in itself is indefinable, since by nature tweets are linguistically restrictive, the thing to take from it is that there is a measurable difference in how individuals respond to climatological changes that they are experiencing daily. These changes have a describable effect on how the population is responding to the publicity surrounding the two terms to the point where it can be used to manipulate governmental policy [
  <a rid="pone.0138996.ref052" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0138996.ref052">52</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sentiment analysis is a tool that can be used to determine how the population feels about a topic; however, the nature of the algorithm makes it hard to effectively determine how this is being assessed. For the current study, the sentiment analysis showed that there was a greater negative association with the term global warming than with the term climate change. This difference, which while being an expression of individual like or dislike at the time the tweet was created, denotes that the two terms were either not understood in their true form, or that individuals may have a greater familiarity with one term over the other, which may be due to a longer exposure to the term (GW) or the negative press associated with the term (GW).</p>
