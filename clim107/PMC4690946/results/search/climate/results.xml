 <result pre="communications to help catalyze public opinion to support more robust" exact="climate" post="action. Because health education and communications are a routine"/>

 <result pre="private funders could more explicitly permit or encourage integration of" exact="climate" post="change, wherever relevant, in currently funded programs. Finally, foundations"/>
 <result pre="are hungry for such a movement in public health for" exact="climate" post="change. Despite the challenges, our respondents identified an array"/>
 <result pre="initiatives that provide hope that, as the magnitude of the" exact="climate" post="change threat to health becomes ever more apparent, the"/>
