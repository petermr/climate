 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “PH engaged” and “Non-PH” participants identified similar opportunities for public health sector engagement through integration of climate change into existing programs, engagement in climate action planning and policy, support for climate solutions with health co-benefits; and communicating with, engaging and mobilizing impacted communities and other public health professionals. “PH non-engaged” participants expressed a desire for further training and education on climate change and public health, and how they might become engaged.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.1. Integrate Climate Change into Current Public Health Practice</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both public health participant groups expressed doubt that there would be significant new funding for public health agencies to work on climate change, suggesting a strategy to integrate climate change into existing programs where feasible. To promote greater engagement respondents advised: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“…first help people see that they already are influencing issues around climate change with what they do every day. Just tweaking and finessing it rather than completely changing their workload.”</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examples provided included integration of climate projections into accreditation-required community health assessments and public health emergency preparedness, home visitation program referrals for energy efficiency improvements, articulation of climate co-benefits in chronic disease prevention programs (e.g., active transportation), and inclusion of climate-related health outcomes in existing disease surveillance programs. Respondents cited the need for greater funding flexibility and workforce capacity building to implement these suggestions.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“PH non-engaged” and “Non-PH” respondents asked for more information on the range of health and equity impacts of climate change and climate solutions—including downscaled local health impacts—and how these connect to current work. A “PH non-engaged” respondent observed: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“We are involved with work on air quality, safe neighborhoods, reduction of traffic, water quality, biking paths, walkable communities, and obesity prevention (through community gardens, famers markets, and city planning). I do not make the links explicit currently, but would be interesting in doing so with guidance on ‘how to’”.</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some “PH engaged” respondents noted that adequate evidence for action already exists, and that the real need is for greater dissemination of existing knowledge: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“The public health sector needs to get their research out there. Good work has been done, but it has not effectively been shared with the public…both at community and institution level. This would provide opportunities for advocacy and help put pressure on legislators to introduce stronger legislation with more information on public health.”</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.2. Provide Active Inter-Sectoral Support for Climate Solutions with Health Co-Benefits</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“PH engaged” respondents explained that most climate change strategies and solutions work on social determinants of health, and that public health’s presence in this inter-sectoral work would improve health inequities and resilience across many outcomes. Climate change work could also be a vehicle for getting out of the silos and limited framework that public health is perceived as being constrained by, thereby improving public health practice broadly. A “PH engaged” said: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“There’s a lot of research supporting that active transit and affordable housing will have a climate change impact. It’s a multi-step connection, but people don’t often make the connection in lectures to elected officials or presentations at Commission. They sometimes connect the dots, but they may just be listed as a bullet on why active transportation is good.”</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A “Non-PH” participant agreed: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“With health and adaptation, it’s still complicated for a planner to understand. We understand extreme heat events, but I don’t have a background in terms of thresholds and what numbers matter. It’s still hard for me to understand what the community impact will be. I couldn’t go the next step and say the risk for my community in terms of health is this. Public health can make that data more accessible to planners like me.”</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents from all groups identified climate change actions with health co-benefits, such as active transportation, wildfire prevention, or agricultural land conservation, and believed that more active public health support could enhance decision-maker support for these policies. Some suggest building on Health in All Policies and Health Impact Assessment practice, and bringing a health equity lens to climate change discussions. “PH engaged” felt strongly that both climate change mitigation and adaptation must be addressed, but several believed that mitigation might offer greater opportunity to address the social determinants of health.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Non-PH” respondents—especially non-governmental organization staff—felt the public health sector should use its special authority and 
   <span class="italic">“show up”</span> for climate change decision-making.They emphasized that they were ready, eager, and willing to incorporate health impacts and co-benefits into their climate change work, and partner with public health to bring public health implications of climate change work into public debate and decision-making spheres.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3.2.3. Engage and Mobilize Health Professionals and Impacted Communities with a Health Frame</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Respondents engaged with climate change from within public health and non-public health said that there was a need for a larger movement on climate change. Across groups, but particularly in the “Non-PH” group, respondents felt that 
   <span class="italic">“the public health sector has a lead role to play”</span> in facilitating this magnitude of change. As a first step, several respondents suggested that public health needed mobilization from within the field. They suggested a coordinated, funded strategy that convenes the public health sector, aligns their various work to address climate change, and facilitates a larger health movement for climate change.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foundations were seen as having a significant role in facilitating this movement by coordinating funding streams and creating a collective impact approach for work at the intersection of climate and health. Some respondents referenced the sense of urgency, strategy, and unity of purpose when foundations set priorities and aligned funding streams around place-based health and obesity prevention; seemingly unrelated public health activities across a range of issues now appeared to be integral parts of a strategic movement with a purpose and vision. The foundations provided the leadership, and public health leadership followed suit.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, “Non-PH” respondents held that “
   <span class="italic">There is a vacuum in the government in communicating with the public, and public health should claim that as its area.”</span> They would like to see health-framed communications about climate change and its health impacts, and strongly believed that the public health sector has the credibility and connection to communities that could be used to mobilize public support for health-protective action on climate change. One respondent who had experience framing climate change as a public health issue in political campaigns noted that public health: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“
     <span class="italic">…was the motherhood &amp; apple pie of that (political campaign). Our opponents couldn’t criticize or devalue them as a messenger. They were a messenger beyond reproach, with a message beyond reproach”.</span>
    </p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Non-PH” participants wanted public health to use this “
   <span class="italic">heft</span>” more to change public discourse around climate change: 
   <div class="disp-quote">
    <p>“There is a lot of messaging that the public health community could do, to create an environment where policy can thrive. We have pushback from conservative movements. People who are wavering and on the fence, don’t take time to read science, they can hear a public health voice more than a planner or politician.”</p>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, some “Non-PH” respondents noted the need for a more coherent public health communications strategy on climate change, grounded in better research and lessons from prior successful social norms change campaigns 
   <span class="italic">“that have moved a whole population, be it Mothers Against Drunk Driving or Anti-Tobacco, and that really changed the social fabric and the way people think about things and what they’re willing to do.”</span> Theserespondents suggested that public health could provide a unifying frame linking climate change, health, environmental justice, social justice, and equity, and supporting an integrated approach. “
   <span class="italic">There is good work happening in silos, but the community needs a more cohesive vision to move forward and health might provide that cohesion.”</span> Some respondents felt that public health messaging could ground “climate change” framing, in that: 
   <span class="italic">“Public health makes climate change real for these communities.”</span>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, respondents across groups believed that public health could partner more strategically with climate change organizers to engage, partner with, and mobilize communities most impacted by climate change. Many noted that public health agencies already work with these communities, and that public health workers can work with community members to identify and define climate and health problems, and ensure that climate solutions do not negatively impact disadvantaged communities. One climate change organizer stated, 
   <span class="italic">“Human rights and health have narrative power…It’s a great litmus test for most policy proposals.”</span> Another noted: “
   <span class="italic">Every municipality in the city is working on climate action planning. We can be at every one of those… and health can get us there, connect grassroots groups to each other so there is something to mobilize for. We haven’t had that meta-frame.”</span>
