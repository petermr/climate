  <span class="italic">Belief that Climate Change is not Urgent, Immediate, or a Priority</span> 
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The “PH engaged” respondents were, not surprisingly, highly aware of the health risks of climate change and the urgency of response. A number of these respondents from public health organizations recognized as leaders in climate change work did not feel it was a priority of their organization. The primary motivation for many “PH engaged” respondents’ engagement in climate change work is that those activities serve as a platform to address larger community health needs.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While there was interest and concern about climate change among “PH non-engaged” professionals, this group expressed less interest, urgency, or recognition of the breadth and currency of climate impacts on health, or that interventions are required now to prevent more severe future impacts. One respondent noted that the health impacts of climate change “
  <span class="italic">seem like a reach.”</span> Many of these respondents see the impacts as too distant in time and place to be of concern, “
  <span class="italic">a pervasive perception that climate change will happen in the future”,</span> although several acknowledged the need for public health response to extreme weather events. Almost all respondents—including those engaged with climate change—believe there is a lack of tangibility or immediacy to the issue; that makes it too abstract for people to engage with. For those “PH non-engaged” respondents that did perceive climate change as an immediate and urgent threat, it was not a priority for their organization or agency.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“PH non-engaged” interviewees expressed skepticism that climate change was a pressing issue for the communities they serve, relative to gun violence, unemployment, or housing issues. One respondent pointed out: 
  <span class="italic">“We can’t expect people to think about the future if they don’t have their immediate needs met.”</span> The exception to this was “PH non-engaged” respondents working in environmental justice organizations, who highlighted the importance of environmental protection—including climate change—for the communities they represent: 
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>“In our community, there is a deep tie to the environment that is so dismissed: Latinos care about the environment because of the environment, not just for self-interest…People feel a strong tie with the land…We came from agrarian societies, and voters would support policies that protect water, trees, and land, even with costs associated. They understand the psychological benefits of preserving the earth, as well as the health benefits…That view is not well understood in the larger equity movement.”</p>
