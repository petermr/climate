 <div class="title">A. “Public Health Engaged” Interview Tool</div>
 <sec class="sec" xmlns="">
  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A1. Introduction</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thank you for agreeing to meet with me/us. We are working with the Public Health Institute Center for Public Health and Climate Change on a project funded by the Kresge Foundation. We see climate change as one of the greatest health and equity challenges of the 21st century, and we also see that many climate action strategies could have very positive impacts on health. The goal of this project is to find out how to make it easier for the public health community to work on climate change and strengthen partnerships between public health workers and others who are working on climate change. We also want to know how public health could help others working on climate change to bring a stronger health frame to their work. We are starting by speaking to people in public health, climate change, equity, planning, environmental justice, and other fields, to learn more about their work and get their ideas on what would be helpful.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Everything you tell me will be kept strictly confidential, unless we specifically ask for your permission to quote you. I‘ll be taking notes, but only my co-investigator and I will have access to them. You should feel free at any time to ask me questions concerning the interview or the project, or to decline to answer a question. Do you have any questions? OK, let’s get started.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It will help to define what we mean by public health and climate change up front.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We’re defining “public health” broadly to include the “upstream” or social, environmental and physical determinants of health, such as asthma from air pollution, housing conditions, education, income, access to healthy foods and transportation, 
   <span class="italic">etc</span>. When we talk about “public health workers” or “public health organizations”, we are talking about people both inside and outside of government that are working on any aspect of trying to improve population and community health.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When we talk about the impacts of climate change on health, we’re talking about both direct impacts like extreme heat, indirect impacts like rising food prices from drought, and the health effects of various strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as decreased air pollution from higher fuel efficiency. Also, this project is focused more on the US than on international issues, even though we understand that the global impacts are very significant.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A2. Public Health Involvement and Role</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, can you tell me a little about the work you do, especially work which you think relates directly or indirectly to climate change or co-benefits?</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">* You’ve talked about climate change and its links to (public health topic areas they mentioned). Are there other areas where you see key connections between climate change and public health, for example like emergency preparedness, vector-borne diseases, chronic diseases, and how do you see those links? 
   <div list-type="bullet" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>What about areas like maternal and child health, infectious diseases, or reproductive health?</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What are your thoughts about the role of public health and public health workers in climate change—what should the public health community—inside and outside of government public health agencies—be doing about climate change? If you had lots of resources, in an ideal world, what would public health be doing around climate change?</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do you think that we should be striving to get everyone in public health engaged in climate change, or do you think we should focus on building expertise in a smaller more focused group of public health workers, or both? Do you have any thoughts about reaching out to workers engaged in direct service – like public health nurses, or restaurant inspectors or WIC workers about climate change, and whether they could or should have a role in climate change work?</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A3. Framing</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do you think there is a way we could use a health frame or health focus to help the public become more aware of and engaged with climate change?</p>

    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>Are there any health messages frames that been particularly effective in your experience, or ideas you have as to what you think could be most compelling for your co-workers?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <p>What about for the clients and population that you work with?</p>
    </div>
   </div>
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some people—with some support from polling data—think that it’s important to talk about the health co-benefits of climate action—for example, the air pollution benefits of (AB32), but to refrain from saying the words “climate change” or “global warming”; others think it’s very important to actually say the words “climate change”. What are your thoughts about that?</p>
