 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Earth’s surface has been successively warmer over each of the last three decades compared to any preceding decade since 1850 [
  <a rid="B7-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B7-animals-05-00361">7</a>]. Human activities are responsible (with a 95%–100% probability) for the recent global warming and the marked increase in global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>), methane (CH
  <sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O) to above pre-industrial values [
  <a rid="B8-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-animals-05-00361">8</a>]. By sector, greenhouse gas pollution originates primarily from industry; agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU); buildings; and transport [
  <a rid="B9-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-animals-05-00361">9</a>]. Separated out, animal agriculture emits a significant portion, estimated from 7% to 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Livestock contribute both directly and indirectly to climate change. Enteric fermentation and manure associated emissions are direct, while production and transport of feed (including the fossil fuels used in manufacturing chemical fertilizers) and land use changes (such as conversion of forest to pasture and crop land) contribute indirectly [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>]. About 44% of the emissions generated by livestock are CH
  <sub>4</sub>, which is released during enteric fermentation (eructation in ruminants) and emitted from manure decomposition; 27% are in the form of CO
  <sub>2</sub> emitted during the production and transport of animal products and feed, and 29% are N
  <sub>2</sub>O attributable to manure and fertilizer [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. There is a clear need to address the contribution that farming animals makes to global warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To combat climate change caused by animal agriculture, a number of mitigation strategies have been proposed, as well as policy options to implement such strategies [
  <a rid="B11-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-animals-05-00361">11</a>]. A theme that runs through this literature is greater efficiency of production, with the aim to achieve more output for a given level of resources used. As explained in the pivotal 2006 United Nations, Food and Agriculture (FAO) report, 
  <span class="italic">Livestock’s Long Shadow</span>:
  <div class="disp-quote">
   <p>The most promising approach for reducing methane emissions from livestock is by improving the productivity and efficiency of livestock production, through better nutrition and genetics. Greater efficiency means that a larger portion of the energy in the animals’ feed is directed toward the creation of useful products (milk, meat, draught power), so that methane emissions per unit product are reduced. The trend towards high performing animals and towards monogastrics and poultry in particular, are valuable in this context as they reduce methane per unit of product. The increase in production efficiency also leads to a reduction in the size of the herd required to produce a given level of product. Because many developing countries are striving to increase production from ruminant animals (primarily milk and meat), improvements in production efficiency are urgently needed for these goals to be realized without increasing herd sizes and corresponding methane emissions.</p>

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, by far, the most substantial emissions reductions can come through adaptations in current systems rather than requiring a shift to industrialized systems [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. This is important from an animal welfare perspective. While there can be negative animal welfare impacts in all production systems, industrialized production has inherently problematic effects on billions of animals globally. Thus, it is important that there is significant alignment in both animal welfare and climate goals. Some ways in which they are less compatible are discussed in
