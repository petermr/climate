 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As discussed previously, changes to animal diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase animal productivity, but they can also risk harming animal welfare. However, bolstering nutrition by supplementing poor diets or using improved forages can both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve welfare at the same time. In regions of the world with a seasonally dry tropical climate, such as Africa, the low nutritional value of most animal feeds during the dry season is a major constraint on animal productivity [
  <a rid="B172-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B172-animals-05-00361">172</a>]. In developing countries, ruminant animals are often fed on low quality grasses and crop residues (stover). Inadequate nutrition is a key factor limiting fertility [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>]. A large potential to mitigate emissions exists in these low-yield systems. For example, modeling of small ruminant production in West Africa suggests that improvements in forage digestibility, along with other animal health and husbandry measures, can potentially reduce emissions by 27% to 41% of baseline emissions, amounting to 7.7 to 12 million tons of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq. [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Improved forages can be used as a climate change mitigation strategy in both developing and developed regions. Legumes available for grazing ruminants in the United States include clover, alfalfa, crown vetch, and birdsfoot trefoil (lotus). These nutritionally valuable, high protein forages can be incorporated into established pasture or rangeland with interseeding. Not only can improved pastures reduce CH
  <sub>4</sub> emissions from animals, but carbon sequestration in grassland soils can also be increased by planting nitrogen-fixing legumes [
  <a rid="B173-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B173-animals-05-00361">173</a>,
  <a rid="B174-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B174-animals-05-00361">174</a>,
  <a rid="B175-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B175-animals-05-00361">175</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mitigation potential of feeding legumes has been the subject of a substantial number of studies. Simulation results in one study showed that CH
  <sub>4</sub> production is 28% lower with legume forage (alfalfa hay) as compared to grass (timothy hay) when expressed as a proportion of gross energy (GE) intake, and 21% lower when expressed relative to digestible energy (DE) [
  <a rid="B176-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B176-animals-05-00361">176</a>]. These results are corroborated by multiple field studies, which also find lower CH
  <sub>4</sub> with pasture legumes for sheep [
  <a rid="B177-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-animals-05-00361">177</a>] and cattle [
  <a rid="B178-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B178-animals-05-00361">178</a>,
  <a rid="B179-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B179-animals-05-00361">179</a>]. For example, Waghorn 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2002) found that when fed to sheep, a sulla/lucerne feed mixture produced just 19.0 g CH
  <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI compared to fresh pasture, which produced 25.7 g CH
  <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI. In a second trial, lotus produced just 11.5 g CH
  <sub>4</sub> per kg DMI, and by using polyethylene glycol binding to remove condensed tannins (CT), the researchers demonstrated that CT played an important role in this reduction [
  <a rid="B177-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B177-animals-05-00361">177</a>]. Condensed tannins not only lower CH
  <sub>4</sub> production in sheep, but may also have other beneficial effects including improving wool growth and reducing intestinal worm burdens [
  <a rid="B180-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B180-animals-05-00361">180</a>]. However, at least one study failed to find reduced methane production feeding white clover to sheep (Hammond 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>, 2011) [
  <a rid="B181-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B181-animals-05-00361">181</a>], and so more study is required.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One caution: legume consumption in some cases is associated with animal health issues, such as fetal hydrops in periparturient ewes [
  <a rid="B182-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B182-animals-05-00361">182</a>], and bloat with some tropical legumes [
  <a rid="B183-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B183-animals-05-00361">183</a>]. Feeding legumes must, therefore, be carefully managed to avoid animal health problems.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many other feeding management strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions without compromising animal welfare could be better emphasized and further explored. These include improving silage quality with more effective preservation methods [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>]; adding dietary fats, such as coconut, linseed, soybean, or sunflower seed oils [
  <a rid="B184-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B184-animals-05-00361">184</a>,
  <a rid="B185-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B185-animals-05-00361">185</a>,
  <a rid="B186-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B186-animals-05-00361">186</a>]; changes to pasture management such as matching grazing intensity and pasture quality [
  <a rid="B173-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B173-animals-05-00361">173</a>,
  <a rid="B187-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B187-animals-05-00361">187</a>] supplementation of the diet with enzymes [
  <a rid="B122-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B122-animals-05-00361">122</a>,
  <a rid="B188-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B188-animals-05-00361">188</a>] or yeasts [
  <a rid="B189-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B189-animals-05-00361">189</a>], and precision feeding (better agreement between the supply of N in the diet and requirements of the animal, in order to reduce N excretion) [
  <a rid="B190-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B190-animals-05-00361">190</a>,
  <a rid="B191-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B191-animals-05-00361">191</a>], to name just a few.
