 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the FAO, the single most effective GHG mitigation strategy in many regions of the world is to increase animal productivity [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>] (p. 100). Raising imported animals selected for production traits, instead of traditional breeds is part of that strategy. However, the FAO also cautions that while achieving the genetic potential of highly productive breeds is important, these animals should not be imported into environments where climate or management limitations would prevent the animals from achieving this potential. In new regions or countries, animals from genetic lines with high production potential may actually perform worse than native breeds or crossbreeds, especially compared to those well-adapted to local disease and climactic conditions [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>] (p. 104). Some regions have seasonal fluctuations in feed quality and nutrient management, and, as high genetic merit breeds have exacting nutritional requirements, they do not always thrive as expected.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In southern India, for example, efforts to replace the native Vechur cow with imported Holsteins have been disappointing, because Holsteins were not bred for performance under the local conditions. While the small Vechur cows produce only one-tenth of the milk hoped for from Holsteins, they are hardy, heat and humidity tolerant and resistant to local diseases and ticks. Under the these environmental conditions in India, Holsteins do not produce the same milk yield that they do in more temperate climates, and the costs of keeping the animals alive and healthy may be greater than any added productivity [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Africa, resistance to trypanosomiasis is a factor that limits the geographical distribution of cattle breeds. Indigenous taurine (humpless) breeds of cattle including the N'Dama and West African Shorthorn are genetically trypanotolerant [
  <a rid="B104-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B104-animals-05-00361">104</a>], but European taurine breeds have no resistance, and even Zebu cattle imported from other regions of the continent do not thrive in the humid tropics of West Africa occupied by tsetse flies, vectors of trypanosomiasis [
  <a rid="B103-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B103-animals-05-00361">103</a>]. Clearly there are limits to importing more highly productive breeds in this large swath of the world, and such circumstances call in to question the notion of “genetic improvement”—indeed the improved breeds here would appear to be the ones that can best survive the local conditions.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Brazil, more fertile and adapted breeds, such as the Brazilian Gir, are increasing in popularity [
  <a rid="B105-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B105-animals-05-00361">105</a>]. Indigenous breeds are better adapted to local conditions, and more readily able to avoid predators, tolerate heat or other weather extremes, resist parasites and endemic diseases, and scavenge for feed or consume local feed resources. For example, in the subtropical climate zone, with seasonal rainfall patterns that do not permit continuous vegetation growth, Zebu and Sanga cattle are more resistant to ticks and tick-transmitted diseases as well as feed scarcity and seasonal high temperatures [
  <a rid="B106-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B106-animals-05-00361">106</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While promoting highly productive genetics to address climate change will reduce GHG emissions in some ways, maintaining biodiversity and the genetic resources of locally adapted breeds will be needed to complement other climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure the animals thrive. A potential solution may be more research and genetic selection of local breeds, but only with due consideration to welfare. Cradle-to-grave analyses that include the full range of trade-offs will become increasingly necessary [
  <a rid="B107-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107-animals-05-00361">107</a>]. Genetic suitability for survival in less hospitable regions with more variable climates and diverse, changing feed resources is currently, and may become even more so, an essential requirement for both human and animal welfare.
