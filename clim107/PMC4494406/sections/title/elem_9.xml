 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, as animals become more productive, greater feed intake is needed to support the energy requirements associated with growth or lactation, but the proportion of total energy requirements required for maintenance decreases [
  <a rid="B43-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-animals-05-00361">43</a>]. Thus the feed input per unit of product produced is reduced. Further, with increases in productivity, fewer animals are needed to reach a given level of output [
  <a rid="B43-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-animals-05-00361">43</a>]. In the climate change mitigation literature, this concept is often exemplified with dairy cows. For example, in 1944, the diverse breeds comprising the US dairy cow population produced an annual milk yield of 2074 kg per cow, but by 2007 the genetic pool had shrunk, and Holsteins were the dominant breed, while milk production more than quadrupled to 9193 kg per cow. In 1944 there were 25.6 million dairy cows in the United States with an annual production of 53.0 billion kg of milk, while in 2007 the total US dairy herd had declined to 9.2 million cows, but they produced 84.2 billion kg of milk. Because of this per cow increase in production, the total carbon footprint for the US dairy industry in 1944 was 194 million tons of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-equivalent (CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq.), while in 2007 the industry’s carbon footprint was only 114 million tons [

Between 1959 and 2009, there was a 29% increase in the number of hogs marketed in the United States, yet the size of the breeding herd has been reduced by 39%. This is due in part to the steady increase in litter size from 7.10 in 1974 to 9.97 piglets in 2011 and the concomitant change in the amount of pork produced from a single breeding animal from 775 to 1828 kg.

Despite this, the suggestion is that the type of throughput achieved in the United States, if adopted more widely in the developing world, could be an approach to climate change mitigation.

Indigenous breeds are better adapted to local conditions, and more readily able to avoid predators, tolerate heat or other weather extremes, resist parasites and endemic diseases, and scavenge for feed or consume local feed resources. For example, in the subtropical climate zone, with seasonal rainfall patterns that do not permit continuous vegetation growth, Zebu and Sanga cattle are more resistant to ticks and tick-transmitted diseases as well as feed scarcity and seasonal high temperatures [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While promoting highly productive genetics to address climate change will reduce GHG emissions in some ways, maintaining biodiversity and the genetic resources of locally adapted breeds will be needed to complement other climate change mitigation strategies and to ensure the animals thrive. A potential solution may be more research and genetic selection of local breeds, but only with due consideration to welfare. Cradle-to-grave analyses that include the full range of trade-offs will become increasingly necessary [
   <a rid="B107-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B107-animals-05-00361">107</a>]. Genetic suitability for survival in less hospitable regions with more variable climates and diverse, changing feed resources is currently, and may become even more so, an essential requirement for both human and animal welfare.
