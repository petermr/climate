 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While genetic selection for productivity can have negative side-effects for animal welfare, this is not necessarily always the case. Although progress may be slow, it is possible to select for both welfare associated traits and productivity simultaneously. For example, while there is an overall negative correlation between walking ability and growth rate of broiler chickens, some individuals do have both good gait scores and high productivity. Given enough time, it might be possible to successfully select for both traits [

  <sub>4</sub>/unit animal product) is reduced. The most efficient animals produce less CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O than the population average [

  <sub>4</sub> production could also be a possibility. For example, in one study of sheep the heritability of g CH
  <sub>4</sub>/day was 0.29 with no genetic correlation with live weight, and a slightly economically favorable correlation with fleece weight [
