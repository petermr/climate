 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with swine, genetically linked productivity improvements in poultry have also been tied to climate change benefits through feed conversion efficiency [
  <a rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-animals-05-00361">10</a>] and the extremely rapid growth rate of modern broiler chickens (raised for meat). Broilers now grow from hatch to market weight in five weeks or less. Annual growth rates have increased 3.3% over the past 50 years, and broiler chickens now grow more than four times faster than they did in 1957 [
  <a rid="B72-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B72-animals-05-00361">72</a>]. Using a life-cycle assessment model, one study estimated that genetic changes in average U.K. broiler chickens have achieved a 1% reduction per year in greenhouse gases over the last 20 years [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These animals now grow so fast that muscle outpaces bone development, leading to metabolic bone disease. As a result, broiler chickens often suffer from leg deformities and lameness [
  <a rid="B74-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B74-animals-05-00361">74</a>,
  <a rid="B75-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B75-animals-05-00361">75</a>,
  <a rid="B76-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-animals-05-00361">76</a>], including tibial dyschondroplasia, angular bone deformities, spondylolisthesis, epiphyseitis, and in severe cases, rupture of the gastrocnemius tendon. Studies are consistent in showing that approximately 26%–30% of broiler chickens by 40–42 days of age suffer from gait defects severe enough to impair walking ability [
  <a rid="B76-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-animals-05-00361">76</a>,
  <a rid="B77-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B77-animals-05-00361">77</a>,
  <a rid="B78-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B78-animals-05-00361">78</a>]. Additional research strongly suggests that while conformational differences account for some gait differences [
  <a rid="B79-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B79-animals-05-00361">79</a>], birds at this level of lameness are probably in pain [
  <a rid="B80-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B80-animals-05-00361">80</a>,
  <a rid="B81-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B81-animals-05-00361">81</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not only do rapidly growing broiler chickens suffer from musculoskeletal diseases, but they are also afflicted by metabolic disorders. Ascites is a condition in which rapidly growing broiler chickens do not have the heart and lung capacity needed to distribute oxygen throughout the body and is a leading cause of mortality as the birds reach market weight [
  <a rid="B83-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B83-animals-05-00361">83</a>]. Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) is associated with acute heart failure caused by dysrhythmias. Young birds die from SDS after sudden convulsions and wing-beating, and are frequently found lying on their backs [
  <a rid="B84-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B84-animals-05-00361">84</a>]. The condition has been recognized since the 1950s as more broiler chickens were grown in large numbers for commercial production [
  <a rid="B76-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B76-animals-05-00361">76</a>]. Sudden death syndrome (SDS) and ascites together can account for 50% of the mortality of highly productive broiler chicken strains [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The parent generation of broiler chickens grown for meat shares the same genetics as their progeny. Like breeding sows, these broiler breeders must be feed restricted, or they will suffer from health and reproductive disorders due to weight gain. Parent birds are usually feed-restricted starting when they are as young as one week old [
  <a rid="B87-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-animals-05-00361">87</a>]. In many parts of the world broiler breeders may be fed on a “skip-a-day” regimen, in which the animals are fed as infrequently as every other day—though this practice has been outlawed in several European countries [
  <a rid="B88-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B88-animals-05-00361">88</a>]. Experimental studies suggest that artificial selection for increased body weight may have altered the brain mechanism controlling satiety and appetite [
  <a rid="B89-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B89-animals-05-00361">89</a>], and evidence from behavioral studies suggests that feed restriction interferes with learning [
  <a rid="B90-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B90-animals-05-00361">90</a>] and causes stress [
  <a rid="B91-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B91-animals-05-00361">91</a>,
  <a rid="B92-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B92-animals-05-00361">92</a>], boredom, and chronic hunger [

  <a rid="B94-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B94-animals-05-00361">94</a>,
  <a rid="B95-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B95-animals-05-00361">95</a>]. Breeding birds receive only 25%–50% of the amount of feed they would otherwise eat if given free access [
  <a rid="B93-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B93-animals-05-00361">93</a>]. While free-range chickens normally devote about 50% of their daily time budget to foraging [
  <a rid="B96-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B96-animals-05-00361">96</a>,
  <a rid="B97-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B97-animals-05-00361">97</a>], feed restricted parent birds can consume their daily feed allotment in as little as 15 min [
  <a rid="B87-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-animals-05-00361">87</a>]. Feed restriction is believed to cause undernourishment, nutritional deficiency, and abnormal behavior including increased pecking at non-feed objects, pacing, and heightened aggression [
  <a rid="B87-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B87-animals-05-00361">87</a>,
  <a rid="B98-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B98-animals-05-00361">98</a>]. Given that target body weights for broiler breeders have changed little in the past 30 years, but broiler body weight continues to increase, the welfare of parent birds may become more serious in the future as they will be feed deprived to an even greater extent [
  <a rid="B99-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B99-animals-05-00361">99</a>].
