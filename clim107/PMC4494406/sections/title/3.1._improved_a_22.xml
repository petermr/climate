 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Where climate change solutions and improved animal welfare may dovetail best begins with a focus on the animals. Improving the efficiency of animal production systems by improving animal health and reducing mortality could reduce CH
  <sub>4</sub> and N
  <sub>2</sub>O emissions considerably by reducing losses due to health related production declines and emissions attributed to animals that die before they can reproduce or produce consumable products. In locations where basic veterinary care, vaccinations, clean drinking water, shade, husbandry skills, technical knowledge, financial aid and other vital resources are lacking, there is great potential for improvement. For example, in many developing African and Asian countries, approximately 80% of poultry is still located in village flocks [
  <a rid="B161-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B161-animals-05-00361">161</a>]. Globally, backyard flocks kept for meat and eggs contribute 42.5 million tons of CO
  <sub>2</sub>-eq. in greenhouse gas emissions and have higher emission intensity than intensively confined chickens, due in part to the low feed quality of scavenging birds and the toll that disease and predation take on productivity [
  <a rid="B2-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-animals-05-00361">2</a>]. Vaccinations, providing simple, low-cost protection for newly hatched chicks from predators, supplementary feeding of balanced rations, and basic biosecurity education [
  <a rid="B162-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B162-animals-05-00361">162</a>] could simultaneously improve the welfare of the flocks, alleviate poverty, and potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The climate change mitigation potential of these improvements has not specifically been studied, to our knowledge.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Extending dairy cow lifetime is another potential improvement. Cows can easily live to 15 years of age or longer, but on most intensive, indoor dairy production facilities that typify developed countries the lifespan of a cow is typically closer to six years [
  <a rid="B163-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B163-animals-05-00361">163</a>]. A USDA summary reports the proportion of dairy cows permanently removed from the herd for reproductive problems was 26.3%; 23.0% were removed for udder or mastitis problems, 16.0% for lameness or injury, and 16.1% for poor production [
  <a rid="B52-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B52-animals-05-00361">52</a>]. Similar factors for culling are reported for Canada and European countries [
  <a rid="B163-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B163-animals-05-00361">163</a>]. In one study of 14 Irish dairy herds, the rate at which cows were replaced in the herd increased from 16% in 1990 to 27% in 2003, an increase of 0.8% per year, and the proportion of cows culled for infertility increased 2.2% per year, from 27% in 1990 to 40% in 2002 [
  <a rid="B164-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B164-animals-05-00361">164</a>]. Improved longevity would reduce the total lifetime emissions of dairy cows when accounting for the resources needed for rearing replacement heifers. The proportion of total methane emissions produced by replacement heifers has been estimated to be up to 27% for U.K. dairy herds [
  <a rid="B165-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B165-animals-05-00361">165</a>]. Relative to the period from birth to first calving (a period that usually lasts from 25 months to about 3 years, depending on the region), a greater number of lactation periods per lifetime will reduce overall CH
  <sub>4</sub> loss per unit of milk yield [
  <a rid="B166-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B166-animals-05-00361">166</a>]. By improving the lifespan of a dairy cow from 3.02 to 3.5 lactations, methane emissions would be reduced by 3% [
  <a rid="B167-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B167-animals-05-00361">167</a>]. Selection for increased productive life could also lead to a decrease in disease incidence of dairy cows [
  <a rid="B168-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B168-animals-05-00361">168</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the future, one possibility for addressing the lack of individual attention on industrialized farms could be “Precision Livestock farming” (PLF). In PLF, sensors continuously monitor key indicators, such as animal movement, feed intake, or temperature and alert caretakers when a problem arises. Examples include using cameras to monitor the behavior of hens, pedometers to monitor estrus behavior of dairy cows, and automated scales for measuring weight gain of chickens [
  <a rid="B169-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B169-animals-05-00361">169</a>]. PLF has good potential for automated detection of animal health problems. For example, auditory sensors can be used to detect disease in fattening pigs by analysis of coughing sounds, which change qualitatively when the respiratory system is infected [
  <a rid="B170-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B170-animals-05-00361">170</a>,
  <a rid="B171-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" href="#B171-animals-05-00361">171</a>]. However, it is uncertain how applicable these highly technical solutions would be in developing countries, and there is a danger of losing genuine husbandry skills and knowledge when relying even more heavily on automation.
