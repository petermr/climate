 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The theory of planned behavior (TPB) is an extension of the theory of reasoned action [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-13162">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-13162">11</a>] and is meant to help explain and predict people’s intentions and behaviors [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-13162">12</a>]. According to the TPB, attitudes toward behavior, subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC) are usually found to predict behavioral intentions; moreover, intentions in combination with PBC are then used to explain variance in behavior [
  <a rid="B13-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13-ijerph-12-13162">13</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A central factor in the TPB is the individual’s intention to engage in a given behavior. Intentions are assumed to capture the motivational factors that influence behavior; they are indications of how hard people are willing to try, of how much of an effort they are planning to exert, in order to perform the behavior. Generally, the stronger the intention to engage in a behavior, the more likely the occurrence of the behavior will be. However, a behavioral intention will be expressed as a behavior only if the behavior in question is under volitional control—that is, if the person can decide at will whether to perform the behavior [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-13162">14</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TPB has often been used to examine the pro-environmental intentions or behaviors of various people [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-12-13162">8</a>]. Using the TPB and the norm activation model (NAM; [
  <a rid="B15-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15-ijerph-12-13162">15</a>]) to examine the energy-saving behavior of households, Abrahamse 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-12-13162">16</a>] concluded that households use energy in not only direct (e.g., gas, electricity, and fuel) but also indirect (e.g., consuming and disposing of goods) ways and found that the variables of both the TPB and the NAM can explain energy-saving intentions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Klöckner 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-12-13162">17</a>] studied energy consumption and transportation and concluded that the TPB effectively explained the variation in student passengers’ travel mode of choice. Tikir 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-12-13162">18</a>] found that the independent variables of the TPB also explained the intention to use public transport. Kerr 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-12-13162">19</a>] indicated that the behavioral intention of the TPB was the strongest predictor of private vehicle use.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to energy use, the TPB has been applied in some studies to other pro-environmental intentions and behaviors. Aertsens 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-13162">20</a>] reviewed studies on pro-environmental behaviors based on the TPB and the modified TPB models that examined personal determinants of organic food consumption. Aertsens 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-12-13162">20</a>] concluded that organic food purchases were positively and significantly related to the intention to purchase such food. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In studies of water conservation behaviors, the TPB successfully predicted intentions to save water, and the variables of the TPB were positively and significantly correlated with water conservation intentions [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-13162">21</a>,
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-12-13162">22</a>,
  <a rid="B23-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-ijerph-12-13162">23</a>]. However, the TPB was less successful in predicting the intention to install water-efficient appliances [
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-12-13162">21</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A meta-analysis from Armitage 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span> [
  <a rid="B24-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-ijerph-12-13162">24</a>] supported the efficacy of the TPB as a predictor of intentions and behavior and suggested that additional normative variables may increase the predictive power of the normative component of the model. Nevertheless, Bamberg and Möser [
  <a rid="B25-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-ijerph-12-13162">25</a>] posited that bias may have led to an overestimation of the intention–behavior correlation.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TPB has been applied to a wide range of human behaviors [
  <a rid="B26-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-ijerph-12-13162">26</a>], and the TPB and related modified models have often been used to examine the pro-environmental intentions and behaviors of various groups of people [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-13162">10</a>]. Ajzen [
  <a rid="B14-ijerph-12-13162" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14-ijerph-12-13162">14</a>] noted that the TPB is open to the inclusion of additional predictors if they can be shown to capture a significant proportion of the variance in intentions or behavior after the theory’s current variables have been taken into account. Thus, to advance analysis using the TPB, this study presents variables to include in the TPB model, among others, that might increase its explanatory power.
