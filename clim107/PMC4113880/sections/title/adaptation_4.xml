 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A paper by Bowen 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. uses social network analysis to identify key organisational stakeholders involved in adaptation activities, such as government ministries in Cambodia; in contrast, donor agencies, development banks and non-government organisations contribute much less to adaptation strategies [
  <a rid="B16-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16-ijerph-11-07347">16</a>]. Adaptive capacity to extreme weather conditions and infectious diseases depends on effective governance and access to resources. Adaptation strategies for populations most vulnerable to the harmful effects of extreme heat in different settings are discussed in a paper by White-Newsome 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. [
  <a rid="B17-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-ijerph-11-07347">17</a>]. A paper by Marinucci 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. in this issue presents a framework to systematically use climate projections to guide public health adaptation. The strategy integrates assessments of climate change impacts, vulnerability assessments, modelling of projected health impacts, evidence-based evaluation of intervention options, strategy for implementing interventions, and systematic evaluation of all activities in an iterative framework [
  <a rid="B18-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B18-ijerph-11-07347">18</a>]. Since socioeconomic status determines adaptive capacity, global pathways have to be developed to demarcate different options of adaptation to be taken. Kris Ebi describes the implications of five reference socioeconomic development pathways to human health, as they relate to increasing socioeconomic and environmental challenges to adaptation and mitigation [
  <a rid="B19-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-ijerph-11-07347">19</a>]. These pathways are important to project the adaptive capacity into the future. Moreover, the systematic collection, merging, integration and analysis of environmental and climatic data with epidemiologic data can generate forecasts and predictions of health outcomes that can help to promote resilience to climate change; two papers in this issue discuss the use of such data sources for epidemiologic analyses for future threat evaluations, outbreak management and interventions to reduce disease burden [
  <a rid="B20-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-ijerph-11-07347">20</a>,
  <a rid="B21-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-ijerph-11-07347">21</a>]. However, these advanced modelling techniques have their limitations too. Anthony McMichael elaborates on the difficulties of conducting global environmental change research: there is a need to examine climate change sensitivity of population health and social stability of past societies; expand the research methods beyond traditional boundaries, and advance trans-disciplinary approaches to forecasting health risk to populations [
  <a rid="B22-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-ijerph-11-07347">22</a>]. Thus, even with the contributions in this special issue of 
  <span class="italic">IJERPH</span>, there are still considerable technical hurdles and obstacles to be taken, not to mention the political ones, in order to advance the field and minimize human health impacts from climate change.
