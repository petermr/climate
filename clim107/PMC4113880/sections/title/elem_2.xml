 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A striking and worrying finding from AR5 is that the capacity of societal structures and natural systems to adapt is finite, and thus subject to adaptation limits (

  <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-07347">1</a>]. For example, coastal cities around the world have already adapted to 19 cm of sea level rise, but some coastal cities might need to adapt to 98 cm as the projections indicate. In many instances adapting to such a differential might not be possible.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important contribution in this special issue of 
  <span class="italic">IJERPH</span> addresses the limitation of humans to adapt to high ambient temperatures. A paper by Harlan 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. analyses heat-related mortality in cities with a hot climate at present. Even in cities that have already adapted to predictable periods of high temperatures, heat-related mortality increases during hot spells [
  <a rid="B8-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B8-ijerph-11-07347">8</a>]. There are obviously physiological limits to extreme heat exposure and global climate change will turn certain parts of the world that are currently highly populated uninhabitable if the average global temperature rises by at least 7 °C [

  <a rid="B10-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-11-07347">10</a>]. The projected heat-related mortality rates in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were the highest in New York city, followed by Philadelphia and Boston revealing considerable vulnerabilities and challenges to adaptation.

  <p>Note: Impacts are identified in eight health-related sectors based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments by authors of Chapter 11 of IPCC WGII AR5 [
   <a rid="B1-ijerph-11-07347" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-11-07347">1</a>]. The width of the slices indicates in a qualitative way the relative importance in terms of burden of ill-health globally at present and should not be considered completely independent. Impact levels are presented for the near-term era of committed climate change (2030–2040), in which projected levels of global mean temperature increases do not diverge substantially across emissions scenarios. For some sectors, e.g., vector-borne diseases, heat/cold stress, and agricultural production and under-nutrition, there may be benefits to health in some areas, but the net impact is expected to be negative. Estimated impacts are also presented for the longer-term era of climate options (2080–2100), for global mean temperature increase of 4 °C above preindustrial levels, which could potentially be avoided by vigorous mitigation efforts taken soon. For each timeframe, impact levels are estimated for the current state of adaptation and for a hypothetical highly adapted state, indicated by different colours.
