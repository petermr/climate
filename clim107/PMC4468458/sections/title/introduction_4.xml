 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Global warming is one of the emerging concerns for the 21
  <span class="sup">st</span> century and is increasing in such a way that environmental temperature has been risen about 0/5-1°C since the mid-21
  <span class="sup">st</span>-century.[
  <a rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref1">1</a>] Strong scientific documents suggest that climate and weather changes are quickly rising. Human activities especially fossil fuels burning is one the important resources of global warming.[
  <a rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref2">2</a>] Children and infants are vulnerable people who are most at risk of climate changes related effects because of physical and physiological condition and lack of recognition maturation.[
  <a rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref3">3</a>] Environmental hazards quickly change and increase in result of the increase in climate change and harm to younger children and infants more than others.[
  <a rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref4">4</a>] Preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) are two important problems that may lead to mortality and other birth diseases and can affect significantly on other problems and diseases in future life of child.[
  <a rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref5">5</a>] Although hazards of climate changes for human health are known[
  <a rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref6">6</a>] but extent and amount of these hazards and its consequences especially on pregnancy are not yet recognized. Given the importance of the effects of climate change on pregnancy outcomes, and in turn the lifelong effects of adverse pregnancy outcomes; the present study has considered the effects of climate changes on pregnancy outcomes including LBW and PTB using a systematic review.
