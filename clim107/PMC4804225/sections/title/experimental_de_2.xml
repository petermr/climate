 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The questionnaire is designed to evaluate willingness to pay (WTP) in Germany for an increase in the CO
  <sub>2</sub> reduction target of 30% to 40% by 2020 compared to 1990. The target increase from 30% to 40% was selected for the contingent valuation (CV) scenario because it closely represents Germany׳s climate change mitigation strategy.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three versions of the questionnaire differed only by question format. The question formats employed are the dichotomous choice (DC) referendum, the dissonance minimizing (DM) referendum and the two-way payment ladder (TWPL). The DM referendum provides further categories to the standard DC referendum, which allow the respondent to express favour for the referendum without having to agree to pay the posted price 
  <a rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib2">[2]</a>. The TWPL gives subjects the opportunity to express their WTP as an interval. The bid vector for all treatments comprised 14 bid levels from very low values to very high values: {48; 72; 84; 108; 156; 192; 252; 324; 432; 540; 720; 960; 1200; 1440} € per household per year. WTP is expected to differ across formats because of the differing response incentives they pose

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The questionnaire is structured as follows: After a few introductory questions an information screen informed briefly about possible climate change mitigation measures that are prominent in the public discussion about the climate policy mix in Germany. After the information screen, subjects were presented a short cheap talk script and afterwards the CV scenario with the varying question formats.
