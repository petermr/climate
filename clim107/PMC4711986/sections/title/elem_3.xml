 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We assess the effects of climate on the abundance distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs in a set of study localities along a 1500 km-long belt crossing Spain and Morocco (
  <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>). This is a preliminary step to understand the effect of climate change on birds. We assume that climate can affect the distribution of wintering passerines in two main ways. First, food availability (e.g. seeds, fruits, invertebrates) is ultimately derived from plants and the effect of climate on plant productivity (e.g. through precipitation or temperature) influences bird abundance [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref017">17</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref018">18</a>]. Second, low temperatures increase the energy demands of these small birds, which are then forced to increase food intake to cope with thermoregulatory requirements [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref019">19</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref020" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref020">20</a>]. As a result, it can be postulated that the occupation of warm areas will decrease the need for thermogenesis and thus reduce individual daily energy requirements, enabling more birds to occur at a given level of productivity [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref021" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref021">21</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref022" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref022">22</a>]. However, this effect of climate on bird distribution could be affected by the competing effects of other geographical and environmental features [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref023" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref023">23</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref024">24</a>]. For instance, pipits and chiffchaffs arrive at the study area from the north. This seasonal afflux of birds could decrease the number of individuals involved in the colonization of the southern border of the winter range. This is usually related to the positive effect of migration length on mortality and energetic costs [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref026">26</a>]. Similar effects have already been reported in this wintering ground, where migratory fluxes affect winter distribution of birds [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref027">27</a>,
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref028">28</a>]. In addition, birds are strongly affected by vegetation structure so that the availability of suitable sites will strongly affect their presence in a given area [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref029">29</a>]. Thus, given the multiple determinants of bird distribution, we use a multivariate approach to assess the relative contribution of climate vs. other geographical and habitat predictors on the distribution of pipits and chiffchaffs.
