  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the localities where ringed birds were recorded in December, January and February (374 for the meadow pipit and 516 for the chiffchaff; duplicate records in the same localities were removed in each replicate) as presence data (
   <a rid="pone.0146958.g002" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0146958.g002">Fig 2</a>). These records result from birds ringed in breeding grounds or during the migratory displacements that have been recovered in the study region from 1960 to 2010. Most of meadow pipits ringed in breeding grounds (n = 63) arrived from the United Kingdom (55%) and Germany (17%) while most of the chiffchaffs (n = 81) arrived from Germany (35%), Belgium (26%) and France (17%).The geographical location of ring recovery localities (latitude and longitude) was used to run Maxent combined with the climate variables (temperature, precipitation, precipitation seasonality; see above). Since ring recovery distribution can be affected by human activity (e.g. more records are gathered in the most populated areas) [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref010">10</a>], the layer of human footprint (an index of population density, land transformation and road density) [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref060" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref060">60</a>] was used as a bias grid to distribute 10,000 background points with a likelihood of presence proportional to the human footprint index. Maxent (log output; regularization multiplier b = 1; autofeatures; convergence threshold = 0.00001) was run in 10 replicates with 75% of the presences as training data and the rest as test data for internal verification. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provided by the receiver operating characteristic curves was used to assess the congruence between observed and detected records in the test data reserved for verification in Maxent [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the data provided by line transects to test the ability of Maxent models to predict bird distribution. To do this, we divided the occurrence probability resulting from Maxent into three similar interval sectors between the min-max intervals. The resulting ranges were used to define maps of low, medium and high climate suitability for each species. The line transects were distributed within these sectors to test with χ
   <span class="sup">2</span> or ANOVA analyses if the number of localities at which the species are found to occur (occupancy) [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref032">32</a>] and mean abundance increased from low to high climate-suitable sectors [
   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref049" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref049">49</a>]. In addition, since the distribution models were launched to predict climate suitability, the effect of habitat structure on bird distribution was controlled by selecting the habitats mainly used by pipits (grasslands, farmlands, wooded pasturelands; n = 375) and chiffchaffs (wooded pasturelands, farmlands, scrublands, woodlands; n = 320) according to current information on winter habitat preferences [

   <a rid="pone.0146958.ref047" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref047">47</a>]. In this way, we tried to avoid the absences resulting from the unsuitability of some habitats.
