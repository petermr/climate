 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After validation, the Maxent models were used to project the changes in species distribution under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios for 2050 and 2070 (AR5 report) [

  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/</span>). Scenario RCP2.6 is representative of mitigation policy aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2°C. Scenario RCP8.5 does not include any mitigation target [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref062" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref062">62</a>]. We used two independent global circulation models (MIROC5 and CCSM4) suitable for the study area to predict the changes. To obtain a straightforward view of the species distribution in the future, we also averaged all predicted trends for scenarios, models and time periods (2050 and 2070).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Present occurrence probabilities were subtracted from future occurrence probabilities to map the distribution of increasing and decreasing climate suitability sectors. To explore the spatial distribution of climate and climate suitability changes for pipits and chiffchaffs, we distributed 500 random points over the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco (there were actually 493 because seven points were discarded for lack of data). In each point, the reported changes in climate suitability and climate variables were used as response variables and latitude, longitude, latitude x longitude, altitude and altitude
  <span class="sup">2</span> (to detect hump shaped distributions along the elevation gradient) were used as predictors. Present and future scores were compared by repeated measures ANOVA and the spatial trends of changes by GLM analyses. All cartographic data were managed with QGIS 2.8 and GRASS GIS in 10 x 10 km squares [
  <a rid="pone.0146958.ref063" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146958.ref063">63</a>]. Statistical analyses were carried out with Statistica 8.1 (StatSoft, USA).
