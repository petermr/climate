 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To project the potential impact of climate change on dengue (with Monte Carlo 95% confidence intervals), we retrieved province-specific historical values (relative to the 1970—1999 climatology) and projected changes for the years 2030, 2050 and 2080 under three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) for monthly mean temperature and precipitation from the National Institute of Ecology 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-INE1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-INE1">[30]</a> using the coordinates of the centroids of each province. The coordinates of the centroids were obtained using the standard ‘coordinates’ routine within the ‘sp’ package for R 
  <a rid="pntd.0002503-R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pntd.0002503-R1">[31]</a> and a digital map of Mexico. Average monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation were estimated as the monthly averages of the baseline period based on the observational data obtained from the Mexican National Meteorological Service. To generate new temperature values for each scenario, we added the corresponding projected changes to the historical values. Precipitation was rescaled multiplying the historical value by the corresponding projected percentage of variation. Average minimum and maximum temperature, and accumulated precipitation values (historical and projected) lagged 1 and 2 months were then used for the climate change projections.
