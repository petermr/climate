 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To study the effect of emission changes 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> the effect of climate changes, three different emission scenarios were used for the target year of 2020: the “Status Quo” (SQ) scenario, the “Extended Emissions Control” (EXEC) scenario, and the “Maximum Feasible Technological Reduction” (MFTR) scenario [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have performed five sets of simulations. The first set of simulations is with the global Mercury inventory for 2005, three sets of simulations were with each of the 2020 emission scenarios (SQ, EXEC and MFTR), and the last set was with no anthropogenic emissions, called “zero emission”. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f007" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f007">Figure 7</a>, the total deposition to the Arctic (a) and the relative changes compared to the 2005 basic simulation for the 1990s (b) are shown for all 10 model simulations. The MFTR results in 20% lower, the EXEC in 16% lower, while the SQ scenario results in a 6% higher total deposition in the 1990s compared to the 2005 basic emissions simulation. If the anthropogenic emissions are removed the deposition to the Arctic will be 37% lower for the 1990s. The decrease in depositions is in excellent accordance with previous model estimates using the same emission scenarios, with predictions of an increase in deposition in the Canadian part of the Arctic of approximately 5% for the SQ emission scenario and decreases in deposition of 15%–17% for the EXEC and 18%–20% for the MFTR emission scenarios [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the model simulations presented here, the decrease of the Hg deposition due to climate changes are smaller than the decrease due to emission changes in both the MFTR and zero emission scenarios; 18% 
  <span class="italic">vs</span>. 20% or 37%, respectively. When combining the MFTR and zero emission scenarios with changed climate input, the model system predicts total Arctic Hg deposition that are 33% lower for the MFTR emission scenario and 47% lower for zero emission scenario for the end of 21st century compared to end of 20th century (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f007" href="#ijerph-12-11254-f007">Figure 7</a>). The combined effect of changing both emissions and climate input is different than the sum of the simulation with changed emission and the simulation with changed climate.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change of Hg deposition in Arctic due to emission change over time should be even larger, because the amount of global biologically available Hg in soil and ocean will change slowly due to the changed atmospheric fluxes and the removal of biologically available Hg, e.g., by transport of Hg to the deep ocean or by sedimentation, and this will change the remissions and the global atmospheric background further.</p>
