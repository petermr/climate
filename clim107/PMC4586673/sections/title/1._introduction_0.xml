 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mercury (Hg) is a widespread pollutant that can lead to neurological and behavioural effects in infants and higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases for people with elevated exposures [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-11254">1</a>,
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-11254">2</a>]. Hg exists in various forms and occurs naturally in the environment with sources from volcanic eruptions and weathering of naturally enriched rocks. The natural cycling of mercury has been perturbed by emissions from human activities, with small-scale gold mining and coal burning being the largest sources. This has led to at least a two-fold increase in atmospheric emissions since the industrial revolution in the 18th century [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-11254">1</a>]. Hg is distributed globally and is transported to the Arctic via ocean currents and rivers as well as via the atmosphere, which is assessed to be the largest transport pathway [
  <a rid="B3-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B3-ijerph-12-11254">3</a>]. Hg is deposited in the Arctic depending on climatic parameters such as temperature, precipitation and sea-ice coverage as well as complex chemical reactions. The atmospheric transport to and deposition within the Arctic has been studied using advanced atmospheric chemistry-transport models (ACTM) [

  <a rid="B9-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B9-ijerph-12-11254">9</a>]. Once at the surface, Hg enters the food webs where it bioaccumulates and biomagnifies. Levels of Hg in Arctic top predators, such as tooth whales and polar bears, exceed thresholds for adverse effects [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-11254">1</a>]. The Arctic indigenous people are exposed to high concentrations of Hg through the traditional diet rich on fish and marine mammals. Blood levels of Hg in parts of the Arctic population are higher than the safety limit [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-11254">2</a>], although declining trends are found in recent years probably associated with a change in diet [
  <a rid="B1-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B1-ijerph-12-11254">1</a>]. High exposure is especially critical for children during development and can result in neurological disabilities such as language, learning and attention deficits [
  <a rid="B2-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B2-ijerph-12-11254">2</a>]. There is also evidence for higher risk of cardiovascular diseases [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climate has changed in recent decades with the main sign being an increase in global mean temperature. The multi-model ensembles in both the 4th and the recent 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR4 and AR5) project an increase in the global mean temperature in the range of 1–6 °C by the end of the 21st century, relative to pre-industrial temperature levels [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-12-11254">10</a>,
  <a rid="B11-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-ijerph-12-11254">11</a>]. The broad range in the projected temperature increase is linked to the various greenhouse gas emission scenarios used as input to the climate simulations. The changes are projected to be larger in the Arctic than elsewhere. The average temperature increase in the Arctic exceeds 9 °C by the end of the 21st century compared to the 1990s according to one of the intermediate emission scenarios applied in AR4, the SRES A1B scenario. The increasing temperature leads to enhanced seasonal melting of the Arctic Ocean sea ice, retreating of glaciers and melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Changes are also projected for precipitation patterns as well as in weather patterns in general.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Climate change can have an impact on the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere, including atmospheric transport pathways, chemical composition, air-surface exchange processes, and natural emissions [
  <a rid="B12-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12-ijerph-12-11254">12</a>]. Changes in climate will affect the Hg exposure of humans and ecosystems within the Arctic, although the biogeochemical cycle of Hg is complex and all the effects of climate changes are not known [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on the atmospheric transport of Hg to the Arctic and the deposition within the Arctic by making a sensitivity study to see how the ACTM Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) reacts to climate change forcing. We have furthermore studied the contribution from the major source areas (Asia, Europe and North America) and finally we have investigated how changes in emissions affect the deposition in the Arctic compared to changes in climate.</p>
