All vector and parasite traits are assumed to depend on temperature and are modeled with hump-shaped responses fit to laboratory data. Human population density and human recovery rate (
  <span class="italic">r</span>) from malaria are assumed to be temperature independent. When these are combined in the model, the result is a prediction curve of how 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> should vary across temperatures (Mordecai et al. 
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We describe the predicted proportion of optimal 
  <span class="italic">R
   <sub>0</sub>
  </span> using quantiles capturing most (top 25%), high (25–50%), moderate (50–75%), and marginal (75—100%) suitability. These quantiles describe the proximity of temperatures to the optimal transmission temperature, 
  <span class="italic">i.e</span>., the relative transmission risk, which we refer to as relative 
  <span class="italic">R
   <sub>0</sub>
  </span>. The top three quantiles (0–75%) correspond to temperatures that promote malaria, whereas the last (marginal) likely limits transmission. To demonstrate the effects of nonlinear thermal responses, we compared the results with models that used the thermal responses from a previous mechanistic transmission model (Parham and Michael 
  <a rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30">2010</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thermal response models were used to predict relative

  </span> as a function of temperature and mapped onto temperature at 0.01°C increments using a geographic WGS84 (decimal degree) projection map of the African continent. Because moisture availability also limits mosquito survival, we masked areas that are too dry for too long for mosquitoes to develop and survive, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), sensu Suzuki et al. (
  <a rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42">2006</a>), (see below). We then queried the map for suitability quantiles and calculated their areas. We used the statistical program R (R Core Team 
  <a rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34">2014</a>) for our analyses; specifically, we used the packages raster, sp, maptools, and rgdal to import and manipulate raster data as R objects, and rasterVis, lattice, latticeExtra, and ColorSpace to create our visualizations.
