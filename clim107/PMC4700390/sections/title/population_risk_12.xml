 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our population risk map highlights hotspots where high population density overlaps with long season length with most transmission potential (

Specifically, the current year-round most suitable and densely populated Ghana coast of western Africa was predicted to become more seasonal and less suitable for transmission, whereas this high-density, year-round, most suitable hotspot is predicted to shift to the Albertine Rift border of Western Uganda (
