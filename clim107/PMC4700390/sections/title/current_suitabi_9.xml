  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Fig. S1</a>, inset). The area currently containing the most suitable transmission (top 25%) by month in the map of Mordecai et al. (

  <span class="sup">2</span> (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Fig. 1S</a>); this difference is due to the large expanse of moderate suitable temperatures captured in the new model.
