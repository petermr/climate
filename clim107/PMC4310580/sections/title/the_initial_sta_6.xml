 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The introduction of alien species is either intentional, usually for economic benefit of some form, or unintentional, owing to the fact that species move around in all kinds of ways and include human vectors and human-mediated pathways in their dispersal portfolio (Hulme et al. 
  <a rid="b146" ref-type="bibr" href="#b146">2008</a>). For intentional introductions, understanding entrainment risk amounts to investigating the socio-political motivations for introducing new species. These are many and diverse and, through time, have ranged from agriculture and horticulture, which are ongoing (Dehnen-Schmutz 
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">2011</a>), to the activities of acclimatization societies (Cassey et al. 
  <a rid="b56" ref-type="bibr" href="#b56">2004</a>). In the nineteenth century, acclimatization societies were established to ‘improve’ what were considered impoverished biotas in newly colonized regions (e.g. North America, New Zealand and Australia) through the importation of plants, birds and mammals, typically from Europe, but also from other regions. Investigations of survival during transport belong in the realm either of plant propagation and animal husbandry, or maintenance of biocontrol agents (e.g. Teshler et al. 
  <a rid="b289" ref-type="bibr" href="#b289">2004</a>). While these areas may have much to inform the investigation of biological invasions and their evolutionary dynamics (e.g. Vorsino et al. 
  <a rid="b307" ref-type="bibr" href="#b307">2012</a>), we will not consider them here. Rather, our emphasis is on unintentional introductions.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Much of the understanding required to reduce the rates of unintentional introductions is concerned with improving knowledge of the pathways and vectors of invasion (Hulme 
  <a rid="b145" ref-type="bibr" href="#b145">2009</a>). Preventing an invasion is the most cost-effective way of dealing with it (Simberloff et al. 
  <a rid="b267" ref-type="bibr" href="#b267">2013</a>). These pathways and vectors are now becoming much better understood across a range of activities in different areas, and for different organisms (e.g. Drake and Lodge 
  <a rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" href="#b91">2004</a>; Tatem and Hay 
  <a rid="b285" ref-type="bibr" href="#b285">2007</a>; Huiskes et al. 
  <a rid="b144" ref-type="bibr" href="#b144">2014</a>). Changing human traffic patterns in tandem with changing climates (including their variability) is likely to change substantially the sites of entrainment risk for any given location (Tatem 
  <a rid="b284" ref-type="bibr" href="#b284">2009</a>). In consequence, although something of an invasion cycle exists, where disturbed entrainment areas tend to harbour similar suites of species (Lee and Chown 
  <a rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" href="#b171">2009</a>), forecasting which species and areas to prioritize for surveillance may be difficult because of rapidly changing environments and species distributions. Ongoing invasion of source areas (see e.g. Roy et al. 
  <a rid="b251" ref-type="bibr" href="#b251">2011</a>) may likewise mean changing risk profiles. Genomic approaches offer a powerful tool to help manage these risks.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At their most straightforward, DNA barcoding approaches can identify alien species at a given location (Darling and Blum 
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">2007</a>). They are now proving useful for a range of taxa. Mostly, the aim has been to characterize the diversity of an assemblage and identify alien species among its members in a given recipient area, or to verify whether given populations are from species thought to be nonindigenous (e.g. Scheffer et al. 
  <a rid="b255" ref-type="bibr" href="#b255">2006</a>; Smith and Fisher 
  <a rid="b268" ref-type="bibr" href="#b268">2009</a>; Porco et al. 
  <a rid="b221" ref-type="bibr" href="#b221">2012</a>, 
  <a rid="b222" ref-type="bibr" href="#b222">2013</a>; Fernández-Álvarez and Machordom 
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">2013</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="b330" ref-type="bibr" href="#b330">2013a</a>). Such approaches nonetheless are subject to the same kinds of problems as those facing DNA barcoding generally (see review by Taylor and Harris 
  <a rid="b286" ref-type="bibr" href="#b286">2012</a>). These include substantial error rates in some taxonomic groups (e.g. Hickerson et al. 
  <a rid="b136" ref-type="bibr" href="#b136">2006</a>; Meier et al. 
  <a rid="b193" ref-type="bibr" href="#b193">2006</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="b331" ref-type="bibr" href="#b331">2013b</a>) and lack of clarity about the questions being posed or rigorous independent assessment of the hypotheses being tested (Collins and Cruickshank 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2013</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As DNA barcoding approaches were developed, it has now become possible to screen simultaneously samples of many species. Such metabarcoding provides relatively reliable estimates of community composition and turnover (Yoccoz et al. 
  <a rid="b326" ref-type="bibr" href="#b326">2012</a>; Yu et al. 
  <a rid="b328" ref-type="bibr" href="#b328">2012</a>; Ji et al. 
  <a rid="b150" ref-type="bibr" href="#b150">2013</a>). The approach has also been broadened to include what may be termed environmental metabarcoding or eDNA metabarcoding (Taberlet et al. 
  <a rid="b281" ref-type="bibr" href="#b281">2012a</a>; Bohmann et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>). Here, rather than the organisms being sequenced directly, DNA is typically extracted from soil or water (Collins et al. 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2013</a>; Porco et al. 
  <a rid="b222" ref-type="bibr" href="#b222">2013</a>; Piaggio et al. 
  <a rid="b219" ref-type="bibr" href="#b219">2014</a>), but may also come from other sources such as the gut contents of flies (Calvignac-Spencer et al. 
  <a rid="b52" ref-type="bibr" href="#b52">2013</a>). The terms metagenomics and ecogenomics have also been applied to this approach, although typically metagenomics involves analysis of functional characteristics and assembly of whole genomes for microbes (Taberlet et al. 
  <a rid="b281" ref-type="bibr" href="#b281">2012a</a>). Considerable success has been had in detecting invasive alien species using this approach, with the method surpassing traditional survey approaches both in terms of sampling effort and sensitivity. Notable demonstrations thereof are for carp in waterways linking to the Laurentian Great Lakes (Jerde et al. 
  <a rid="b149" ref-type="bibr" href="#b149">2011</a>), the American bullfrog in France (Ficetola et al. 
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">2008</a>; Dejean et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2012</a>) and several other aquatic species (Bohmann et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>; Rees et al. 
  <a rid="b234" ref-type="bibr" href="#b234">2014</a>). Much interest exists in the application of eDNA barcoding to surveillance of ballast water in ships, a substantial source of aquatic invasions, with novel tools being developed to enable rapid screening by nonspecialists (Mahon et al. 
  <a rid="b182" ref-type="bibr" href="#b182">2012</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further area where eDNA metabarcoding is proving useful is in understanding the extent, ecology and ecosystem functioning consequences of microbial invasions (Litchman 
  <a rid="b178" ref-type="bibr" href="#b178">2010</a>; Shade et al. 
  <a rid="b263" ref-type="bibr" href="#b263">2012</a>). Microbial invasions are significant across the globe with substantial impacts on a range of ecosystems and on human and animal health (Van der Putten et al. 
  <a rid="b300" ref-type="bibr" href="#b300">2007</a>; Jones et al. 
  <a rid="b151" ref-type="bibr" href="#b151">2008</a>; Vellinga et al. 
  <a rid="b306" ref-type="bibr" href="#b306">2009</a>; Keesing et al. 
  <a rid="b155" ref-type="bibr" href="#b155">2010</a>; Cowan et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2011</a>; Carroll et al. 
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">2014</a>). Because metagenomics has deep roots in microbiology, the approach enables sophisticated portraits to be painted of the identity of the players involved in a given system, the extent to which invasions are significant and the functional roles that key members of the community play (Litchman 
  <a rid="b178" ref-type="bibr" href="#b178">2010</a>; Cowan et al. 
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">2011</a>; Shade et al. 
  <a rid="b263" ref-type="bibr" href="#b263">2012</a>; Adriaennsens and Cowan 
  <a rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4">2014</a>; Ramirez et al. 
  <a rid="b231" ref-type="bibr" href="#b231">2014</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Metabarcoding and eDNA metabarcoding approaches are not without their problems, including challenges to do both with resolving taxa (see above and Taberlet et al. 
  <a rid="b282" ref-type="bibr" href="#b282">2012b</a>; Brodin et al. 
  <a rid="b44" ref-type="bibr" href="#b44">2013</a>; Pyšek et al. 
  <a rid="b230" ref-type="bibr" href="#b230">2013</a>), and with the skills, methods and databases required to ensure that these approaches deliver their full potential (Yoccoz 
  <a rid="b325" ref-type="bibr" href="#b325">2012</a>). Nonetheless, the field is developing rapidly (e.g. Liu et al. 
  <a rid="b179" ref-type="bibr" href="#b179">2013</a>; Zhang et al. 
  <a rid="b331" ref-type="bibr" href="#b331">2013b</a>; Bohmann et al. 
  <a rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" href="#b38">2014</a>), and management risks posed by differentiating among increasing numbers of species introductions and range shifts precipitated by changing climates (Walther et al. 
  <a rid="b308" ref-type="bibr" href="#b308">2009</a>), could readily be reduced using these approaches.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although barcoding and metabarcoding approaches are increasingly being applied to the detection of invasives and have been used in several successful detections (e.g. Dejean et al. 
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">2012</a>; Collins et al. 
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">2013</a>; Egan et al. 
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">2013</a>; Takahara et al. 
  <a rid="b283" ref-type="bibr" href="#b283">2013</a>), they could also be used to reduce risks of introduction by understanding the composition of species in source hot spots. While doing so might at first seem impracticable, reductions in costs of the technical methods (Lemmon et al. 
  <a rid="b174" ref-type="bibr" href="#b174">2012</a>; Rocha et al. 
  <a rid="b247" ref-type="bibr" href="#b247">2013</a>), and routine surveillance of areas for incoming species (e.g. Bourlat et al. 
  <a rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" href="#b41">2013</a>), which are often the same sources for outgoing ones (Lee and Chown 
  <a rid="b171" ref-type="bibr" href="#b171">2009</a>), mean that the data may become increasingly available for species detection. The main barriers to overcome are making sure that sequence information, biological records and distributional data are available in linked and readily useable forms [although their downstream use also faces a variety of challenges (Amano and Sutherland 
  <a rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" href="#b7">2013</a>)], achieving interoperability among the various approaches and information databases, and estimating the extent of errors of omission and commission for various taxa (Collins and Cruickshank 
  <a rid="b69" ref-type="bibr" href="#b69">2013</a>). While these barriers are high, they are being reduced by increasing discussions among major data providers and ongoing work to improve interoperability. Although this provider approach is important, good practice by investigators (such as coherence in data submitted to major providers) is probably the most significant way to reduce barriers. DNA barcoding approaches may be especially helpful where changing climates encourage change in human agricultural and business practices, creating rapidly changing invasion scenarios.
