  <span class="italic">Ciona intestinalis</span> (Dehal et al. 
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">2002</a>), dengue mosquito vector 
  <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> (Nene et al.

  <span class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</span> (Huang et al. 
  <a rid="b142" ref-type="bibr" href="#b142">2013</a>). Then, there are the genomes of model species that are also invasive, which include

  <span class="italic">D. melanogaster</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D. suzukii</span> (Adams et al.

  <a rid="b58" ref-type="bibr" href="#b58">2010</a>). Some of these species are useful for climatic studies, based on evidence for geographic variation in climate responses in species such as the drosophilids (Hoffmann et al.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many genomic approaches can be applied to population genetic studies of nonmodel species that lack a reference genome assembly. The use of sequence tagging and ‘Pool-Seq’ technologies, together with relatively inexpensive RNA-Seq, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and other reduced-representation library methods, means that data on many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be collected at moderate cost on multiple samples from a population without a reference genome (Box 
  <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" href="#bx1">1</a>) (e.g. Hohenlohe et al. 
  <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2010</a>; Elshire et al. 
  <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>; Bi et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>; Neves et al. 
  <a rid="b206" ref-type="bibr" href="#b206">2013</a>; Yeaman et al. 
  <a rid="b324" ref-type="bibr" href="#b324">2014</a>). However, even draft reference genomes or genomes from related species can be useful when implementing these approaches to identify variants. The expansion of reference genomes across a wider array of species will facilitate the study of invasion genomics. Several impediments to genome construction still exist (Ellegren 
  <a rid="b95" ref-type="bibr" href="#b95">2014</a>), although new technologies are emerging to overcome them and the cost of short-read sequencing is declining. Nonetheless, many plants and animals have large genomes, and the common occurrence of higher ploidy, especially in invasive plants, adds significant difficulty and expense. Higher ploidy also complicates other approaches such as SNP identification and analyses (see below).

   <p>Whole-genome resequencing is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary in many cases. As an alternative, several methods of genome reduction make it possible for many individuals to be combined in one sequencing run while maintaining high coverage. This results in the reliable identification of SNPs and genotypes for each individual at a subset of regions throughout the genome.</p>
   <p>Restriction-enzyme-based reduced-representation sequencing: Genomic DNA is digested with specific restriction enzymes, followed by ligation of adaptors, amplification and sequencing. Several methods employ this strategy, including genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS; Elshire et al. 
    <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>) and RAD-Seq (Hohenlohe et al. 
    <a rid="b141" ref-type="bibr" href="#b141">2010</a>). Repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided using methylation-sensitive enzymes (Elshire et al. 
    <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">2011</a>). This approach is relatively inexpensive and easy to use in nonmodel organisms, but can suffer from biases such as those associated with the loss of restriction sites in some individuals (Gautier et al. 
    <a rid="b119" ref-type="bibr" href="#b119">2013</a>).
   </p>
   <p>RNA-Seq: Sequencing mRNA from the genes that are expressed in the whole organism or specific sampled tissues at a particular point in time and development and under specific conditions (the ‘transcriptome’ of a whole organism or specific tissue; Wang et al. 
    <a rid="b309" ref-type="bibr" href="#b309">2009</a>). This method targets the expressed portion of the genome (protein-coding sequences and untranslated regions of genes). Gene expression and sequence information is simultaneously identified, as it is possible to compare counts of reads that map to genes and identify variants given sufficient expression of that gene in each individual.
   </p>
   <p>Targeted sequence capture by hybridization: This approach uses oligoprobes to enrich specific regions of the genome for subsequent next-generation sequencing. The scale of the capture can range from a handful to several thousand targeted loci, making it appropriate for wide range of projects. However, prior genomic knowledge is essential for the development of the probes (e.g. through RAD-Seq or RNA-Seq projects). The development of noncommercial protocols and PCR-based probes (Peñalba et al. 
    <a rid="b214" ref-type="bibr" href="#b214">2014</a>) is making this approach more attractive for smaller-scale sequencing projects in nonmodel species. Several alternative methods are available that enrich target regions prior to sequencing (for review, see Mamanova et al. 
    <a rid="b183" ref-type="bibr" href="#b183">2010</a>).
   </p>
   <p>Gene-space sequencing: Many genomes are replete with repetitive regions along with genes present in high copy number (e.g. chloroplast genes), and whole-genome sequencing without reducing their quantity can be a substantial waste of sequencing space. Consequently, some approaches seek to deplete these regions rather than enrich specific portions of the genome (e.g. Matvienko et al. 
    <a rid="b187" ref-type="bibr" href="#b187">2013</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An important feature of invasive species for evolutionary studies is that the introduction and spread of the invader is often documented (Baker 
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">1974</a>), and in many cases, this includes historic collections. Genomic studies are benefiting from increased progress in obtaining information from specimens stored in herbariums, museum collections or recovered from natural repositories such as sediment layers in lake bottoms (Krehenwinkel and Tautz 
  <a rid="b160" ref-type="bibr" href="#b160">2013</a>; Martin et al. 
  <a rid="b185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b185">2014</a>). Such studies are particularly applicable to invasive organisms that are often represented well in collections with longitudinal sampling. These specimen records often cover periods over which populations have been exposed to relatively rapid climate change (such as between 1970 and 2000) (Hansen et al. 
  <a rid="b132" ref-type="bibr" href="#b132">2013</a>). More formal approaches are also now being applied to secure the preservation of material across time, such as the resurrection initiative for plants (Franks et al. 
  <a rid="b109" ref-type="bibr" href="#b109">2008</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In future, methods can be employed that maximize the genomic information obtained from such limited material, rather than focusing on a few anonymous markers. Whole-genome resequencing has been used successfully for historic samples (Rowe et al. 
  <a rid="b250" ref-type="bibr" href="#b250">2011</a>), although contamination by nontarget DNA can make this expensive proposition even more cost-prohibitive. Sequence capture, which utilizes probes to enrich target sequences (e.g. Bi et al. 
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">2013</a>) (Box 
  <a ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1" href="#bx1">1</a>), offers a compromise between minimizing sequencing costs and maximizing sequence information from target regions of the study organism. Pooling individual samples together prior to either whole-genome (e.g. Futschik and Schlotterer 
  <a rid="b112" ref-type="bibr" href="#b112">2010</a>) or reduced-representation (e.g. Vandepitte et al. 
  <a rid="b303" ref-type="bibr" href="#b303">2012</a>) sequencing is another approach that can greatly reduce costs, while still providing useful information about the genomic extent and location of variation and divergence. Genome-wide analysis of historic DNA in invasive species will provide exciting opportunities to assess the temporal dynamics of evolutionary change during colonization and spread, and over periods of rapid climate change. It can also provide evidence of past changes in population size across time through coalescence methods (do Amaral et al. 
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">2013</a>) and indicate parts of the genome that have been affected by selection and population processes (Excoffier et al. 
  <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">2009</a>). Such data will improve inference of invasion history and aid in the identification of the genetic basis of recent adaptation.
