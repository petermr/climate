 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall climate vulnerability was estimated using a four step process. First, the component scores (low, moderate, high and very high) were assigned a numerical value (1, 2, 3, and 4). Second, an average score for each climate exposure factor and sensitivity attribute was calculated as the weighted-mean of the experts’ tallies. Third, an overall exposure and sensitivity score was calculated from the weighted means using a logic rule (
  <a rid="pone.0146756.t003" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146756.t003">Table 3</a>). Fourth, an overall climate vulnerability score was calculated by multiplying the overall exposure and sensitivity scores. The product of the two component numeric scores results in a value between 1 and 16. The overall climate vulnerability rank is then classified as follows: 1–3 low, 4–6 moderate, 8–9 high, and 12–16 very high.
