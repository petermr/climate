 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study area was the Northeast U.S. Shelf, which ranges from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina through the Gulf of Maine (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0146756.g002" href="#pone.0146756.g002">Fig 2</a>). The focus was on species that occur in marine waters of the Northeast U.S. Shelf, but a number of these species use freshwater, estuaries, and offshore areas during some portion of their life history [
