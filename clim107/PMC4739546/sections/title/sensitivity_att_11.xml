 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sensitivity attributes represent biological traits that are indicative of an ability or inability of a species to respond to environmental change. All 12 attributes defined in the NMFS Climate Vulnerability Assessment Methodology [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref034">34</a>] were used here (
  <a rid="pone.0146756.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0146756.t002">Table 2</a>). As an example, the Adult Mobility of a clam is low and as a result, adults would be unable to move as climate changes making them more vulnerable to climate change. The definition for a few sensitivity attributes varies slightly from those presented in the NMFS Methodology [
  <a rid="pone.0146756.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0146756.ref034">34</a>] (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0146756.s003" href="#pone.0146756.s003">S1 Supporting Information</a>) due to minor changes in the definitions in the methodology, which occurred after the implementation described here.
