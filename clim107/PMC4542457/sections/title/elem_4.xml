  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>], but this does not necessarily mean that they underestimate the intensity of precipitation extremes. For example, in an analysis of 30-year return values of daily precipitation over the conterminous USA, most global climate models were found to overestimate or roughly agree with observations that were conservatively interpolated to the model resolution for comparison [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. (Appropriate interpolation of precipitation is important because of mismatches in time and space scales between models and observations.) One exception was the Community Climate Model System 3 which underestimated the 30-year return values [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>], and increased horizontal resolution [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" href="#CR90">90</a>] or use of superparameterization [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>] has been shown to improve the representation of the intensity distribution of precipitation in the Community Atmosphere Model versions 2 and 3. The model bias of too-frequent precipitation mentioned above will affect percentiles calculated over only wet days rather than all days [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>], even if the extreme events are properly simulated, which suggests that calculating extremes using all days (or all hours) is preferable for comparison of precipitation extremes between models and observations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As compared to the extratropics, the intermodel range in the sensitivity of precipitation extremes is much larger in the tropics (Fig.

   <span class="sup">−1</span> in others. Additional reasons to doubt the response of tropical precipitation extremes in these global climate models include the large differences between tropical precipitation extremes in the twentieth-century simulations in different models [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], the inability of the models to represent mesoscale convective organization [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" href="#CR72">72</a>] or to simulate the interannual variability in tropical precipitation extremes when compared to observations [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Observations can be used to better constrain the large uncertainty in the response of tropical precipitation extremes to warming. The sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for climate change in different climate models is correlated with their sensitivity for shorter term variability within a climate (variability that is primarily related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. For example, models with a relatively high sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for climate change also have a relatively high sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for variability in historical simulations, although the sensitivities for climate change and variability are generally different in value. The robust relationship between the sensitivities for climate change and variability has been used together with observed variability to constrain the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes to climate change [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>]. The black line in Fig.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>], the analysis is applied separately to the sensitivity for climate change in 10° latitude bands in both the tropics and extratropics.
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" href="#Fn3">3</a> This observationally constrained estimate is similar to the multimodel median in the extratropics but higher than the multimodel median in the tropics. It peaks near the equator and is higher for the tropics (11 % K
   <span class="sup">−1</span>, 90 % confidence interval 7–15 % K

   <a rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" href="#Sec2">Observed Changes in Precipitation Extremes</a>”). For the tropics, there still remains considerable uncertainty in both the estimate from rain-gauge data and the observationally constrained estimate discussed in this section, and better constraining the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes is an important research challenge.
