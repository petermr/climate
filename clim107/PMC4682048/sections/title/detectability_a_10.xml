 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two additional measures were employed to elucidate the forcefulness of the ensemble mean projected changes in PV power generation. The signal-to-noise ratio (S2N) refers to the ratio between the magnitude of the ensemble mean change and the ensemble spread. Detectability describes the ratio between the magnitude of the ensemble mean change and the ensemble mean annual variability of the PV power generation series. Therefore, a value of this ratio larger than unity implies that the magnitude of the ensemble mean change falls beyond the expected natural variability of the series.</p>
