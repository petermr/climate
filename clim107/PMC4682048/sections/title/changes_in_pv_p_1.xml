 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ensemble mean pattern of change for mean RSDS, 2070–2099 versus 1970–1999 climatologies (computed without excluding night-time hours), under the RCP8.5 shows positive signals (about 5 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) in Southern Mediterranean regions, negative signals northwards (about −10 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>, down to −20 W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span> in the northernmost areas) and an intermediate strip where the sign of the change is not robust (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>). This latitudinal response is typical of that of the North Atlantic Oscillation during its positive phase, which induces windier and cloudier conditions in northern Europe, less windy and cloudy southwards, compared with what prevails during its negative phases
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" href="#b12">12</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" href="#b13">13</a>. Thus, the above picture could suggest the imprint of the small but positive trend projected for this large-scale mode of climate variability
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" href="#b14">14</a>, since more intense, frequent or persistent positive North Atlantic Oscillation phases would lead to enhanced (depleted) solar radiation in southern (northern) areas within Europe. Weak but significant positive signals expand northwards reaching central regions such as the North of France and Austria, and could occasionally grow up to 20 W m

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a>), negative signals prevail everywhere, with higher amplitude albeit rarely overpassing the limit of −20 W m

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, the ensemble mean projected changes for PVpot (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1b</a>; individual patterns of change in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</a>) unveil negative values in the entire domain of around −10% under RCP8.5, except for small areas where the mean signal is either negligible (Southwestern Iberia) or of uncertain sign (West of France and coastal areas from Italy to Turkey). The corresponding extreme patterns (
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>max</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>min</sub>) show signals up to ±20%. Under RCP4.5, signals are similarly distributed but reduced by about a factor of 2 relative to RCP8.5 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a>). These results frame well with previous findings
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" href="#b7">7</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" href="#b9">9</a>, but PVpot changes have a more negative sign in northern and central areas compared with previous works, which can be attributed to the downscaling process since GCMs used in EURO-CORDEX provide a consistently different picture from that of RCMs (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). In-depth investigation of this feature is beyond the aim of this study, but needs to be addressed in future works to get a higher confidence in the results.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seasonally (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>), the largest ensemble mean RSDS change signals (expressed in absolute terms, that is, in W m
  <span class="sup">−2</span>) occur in spring and summer, when most PV power is produced. The latitudinal pattern (positive southwards and negative northwards) is found in all seasons. These changes, combined with the lower-order effect of changes in TAS and VWS, lead to changes in PVpot that expressed in relative terms (that is, %), are largest in winter (up to −20%) and smallest in summer. However, in summer, the discrepancy in the sign of the change between individual significant signals provides non-robust ensemble mean signals in large areas of Central Europe, a feature not seen in the other seasons.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Regarding the role of TAS and VWS for PVpot projections, it is evident that the positive (negative) changes in radiation are downgraded (strengthened) by the poorer panel efficiency in a TAS-increased scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1a–d</a>). This is in agreement with previous studies based on different assumptions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" href="#b2">2</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" href="#b3">3</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" href="#b8">8</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" href="#b15">15</a>. While projections for VWS are largely uncertain, having a negligible impact on PVpot (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1e,f</a>), projections for TAS are positive in the whole domain, varying from 3 to 5 °C in the RCP8.5 ensemble mean pattern, and have associated mean induced changes in PVpot of −3% in the South and East of Europe (see the procedure followed for these estimates in Methods; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</a> shows the results for the RCP4.5 case). TAS changes exert the largest influence on PVpot over southern regions in summer, while it is largely negligible in the winter season (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</a>). Although the projected increase in RSDS largely compensates such TAS-induced effects, these results call for future efforts to reduce the dependence of the PV cells performance on the ambient temperature, as already stated in ref.
