 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Going a step further to evaluate changes in actual PV power generation, we now make assumptions on where the PV power capacity is/will be installed in Europe. For that, the CLIMIX model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a> is applied to the regional objectives for the PV sector proposed by the European Climate Foundation Roadmap 2050 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>) in the 80% renewable energy supply (RES) pathway (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>; see Methods for more details). Under such a fixed scenario of high-PV penetration, a general and progressive decline of the generated PV power is found in all regions along the entire period (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). This is most pronounced in the northernmost region 1, with ensemble mean projected changes up to −6% and −10% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. In Northern, Western and Central Europe (regions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) changes of −3 to −6% are obtained by the end of the century. In Southern Europe, changes are smaller (see also 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>). Note that the fact that changes are expressed here in relative terms partly contributes to obtain the smallest changes over regions and seasons (see also 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</a>) with the highest potential (that is, southwards, summertime).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Except for the regions 4 and 9, the mean projected changes under RCP8.5 exceed the current interannual variability of the PV production series from 2050 onwards (we will call this detectability of the mean change hereafter; see Methods). Under RCP4.5, only the regions 1, 5 and 6 display detectable mean changes from 2050 onwards, and regions 2 and 3 at the very end of the century (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). However, in all cases the magnitude of the ensemble mean projected changes, even for those noted as robust in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>, is smaller than the ensemble spread, indicating a relatively high degree of uncertainty compared with the magnitude of the ensemble mean signals. Only for region 1, and especially under RCP8.5 towards the end of the century, the signal-to-noise ratio (S2N; see Methods) exceeds 1 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>). In regions 2, 3, 5 and 6, with mean changes of about 5% and spreads of 10% by the end of the period, S2N falls down to as far as 0.5 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>). It drops to even below 0.5 in regions 4, 7, 8 and 9 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</a>), although this is neither surprising nor very relevant because mean changes in these regions are (1) close to zero, thus providing a close-to-zero value for the numerator of the S2N ratio, and (2) generally non-robust, that is, the spread mostly involves non-significant signals.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To better understand the aforementioned uncertainty, a two-step one-way analysis of variance
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a> is applied to the set of time series of PV power production anomalies to discern the roles played by the RCP, the GCM and the RCM choice. Results (shown in the small subplots of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>) unveil that the choice of the RCP exerts a small role in explaining the variance among the whole set of time series compared with the GCM+RCM-induced spread, while its influence grows along the century. Overall, the influence of the GCM prevails in the northernmost regions, while in the southern and central regions the RCM plays a dominant role. These latter regions, namely 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, are located in South-central Europe, where regional feedbacks involving temperature, soil moisture and clouds are particularly important
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" href="#b20">20</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" href="#b21">21</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>, inducing a higher variety of model responses than in northern areas with weakly constrained land–atmosphere interactions
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a>. Besides, these southernmost areas have a highly complex orography, which has a strong impact on the simulated regional climates. Worth to note that, while RCMs thus appear more tightly constrained by their driving GCM northwards than southwards, RCMs are able to turn the sign of the projected change in the resource from positive to negative in some northern areas (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</a>). However, as it occurs similarly for all RCMs driven by the same GCM, it is not reflected in the results of the analysis of variance.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, we focus on a key aspect of all weather-dependent renewable energies concerning their grid integration and management: the temporal stability of their supply. Our results indicate that changes in the monthly and annual variability of the PV production series (see Methods) are overall non-significant (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>), while significant reductions of the interannual variability in the winter series of eastern regions appear in the seasonal analysis (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</a>). Although in some cases the ensemble spread leads to uncertainty concerning the mean signals, projected changes in variability at these timescales (annual and monthly) of each of the models separately remain in the range (−1.5%;+3%) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4b,c</a>). By contrast, robust decreases are found for daily variability in a few regions, namely 4 and 8 (ranging from −3 to −9% to the end of the century depending on the region and the RCP), indicating a slightly higher temporal stability of the daily PV production (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4d</a>). This is most evident in region 4, where it occurs in all seasons but winter (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 5m–p</a>) and despite the fact that the daily variability of TAS is projected to increase there, being therefore lead by the projected reduction of the daily variability of RSDS (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 7</a>). In the central region 6, however, a robust positive signal for changes in daily variability is found assuming RCP8.5 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4d</a>). These changes would occur progressively along the entire period, being consistently smaller by mid-century (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 8</a>).
