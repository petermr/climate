 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two ensembles of regional climate simulations spanning the period 1970–2099 were used in this study. Both comprise the same 10 members (involving six different RCMs and five GCM runs; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table 1</a>), but one assumes the moderate RCP4.5 and the other the more marked RCP8.5 (ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" href="#b6">6</a>). The simulations were performed under the umbrella of the EURO-CORDEX project

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, cover Europe with a spatial resolution of 0.11° both in latitude and longitude, the finest so far in this type of climatological multi-model and multi-scenario experiments, and provide records of the output variables every 3 h. The ensemble mean climatologial patterns of all the magnitudes utilized in this study, that is, mean values and variability of several variables at various timescales, are provided in

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A concise evaluation exercise of the simulated RSDS, further supported by the results presented in ref. 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, is also included in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. 9</a>. All ensemble members are well able to capture both the spatial distribution and variability of the observed mean RSDS pattern, which is mainly dominated by a latitudinal gradient both in models and observations. Small negative errors (below 10%) appear in a few points mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, while overestimation errors prevail elsewhere reaching up to 20%. Excessive RSDS is a long-standing problem in climate modelling
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. There is, however, a number of points where positive biases grow even beyond 40%, usually located in mountainous regions, such as the Alps, where the limitation of climate models to reproduce single measurements is well known. Regarding RSDS variability, ensemble mean errors at the annual and monthly (daily) timescales are generally negative and mostly below 2% (10%), rarely up to 6% (15%). However, while the spatial distribution of the simulated monthly and daily variability patterns is acceptable, it is not the case for the annual variability simulated pattern. Nonetheless, taking into account (1) the small number of observational points, (2) the very nature of models that perform a spatial discretization of the simulation domain, along with the actual spatial representativeness of ground-based solar radiation measurements
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" href="#b36">36</a>, (3) the still moderate accuracy of models to properly reproduce cloudiness
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" href="#b37">37</a> and (4) the lack of a dynamically modelling of aerosols concentration levels, the results of this validation exercise are within an acceptable range, thus allowing a moderately high confidence on the analysed simulations.
