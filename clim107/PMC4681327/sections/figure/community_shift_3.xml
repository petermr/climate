  <div class="title">Community shifts: Conceptual and mathematical models of ecosystem dynamics under environmental changes.</div>
  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span> to 
   <span class="bold">C</span>) The plots represent (A) a linear response to a gradual environmental shift with two different communities at both extremes of environmental conditions; (B) a sudden change between states, under which communities can absorb changes in environmental factors until a threshold limit pushes the system from one state to the other; and (C) thresholds with hysteresis occur when different communities can be present under the same environmental conditions. C1, community 1; C2, community 2. (
   <span class="bold">D</span> to 
   <span class="bold">F</span>) Benthic shifts and three possible processes showing diversity variation with time. (D) Classical succession: Community 1 is characteristic of early successional stages, and community 2 represents mature stages. (E) Gradual replacement between communities (for example, in an ecosystem displacement process). (F) Sudden change between communities due to a nonlinear response to environmental conditions. (
   <span class="bold">G</span>) A simple simulation of a multispecies spatial competition model under sedimentation based on Levins competition model.
