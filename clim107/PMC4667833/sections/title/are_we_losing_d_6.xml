 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The southern Amazon is widely known as “the arc of deforestation” due to large‐scale forest clearing for agricultural development (Soares‐Filho et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>). Beyond simply reducing total forest area, this geographically clustered deforestation may be having the additional negative effect of eliminating the populations that are best‐adapted to the dry and seasonal conditions that will be increasingly widespread in the future. To illustrate how deforestation relates to local climate, we mapped current total annual precipitation and MCWD across the Amazon (resolution of 2.5 arc min based on the WorldClim high‐resolution extrapolated climate database; Hijmans et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0029">2005</a>). We then overlaid areas that were mapped as being deforested as of 2002 and in areas that are predicted to be deforested by 2050 under a spatially explicit model of deforestation assuming business‐as‐usual (BAU) rates and constraints (Soares‐Filho et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0065">2006</a>). These analyses clearly show that deforestation is currently occurring and is predicted to occur, predominantly in those areas that have lower annual precipitation (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0003">3</a>A, C) and higher seasonality of precipitation (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0003">3</a>B, D) such as the Amazon‐cerrado ecotone.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To help illustrate how deforestation in the southern Amazon could potentially hinder a species ability to adapt to future climate, we next mapped future climate analogs under the 2002 and 2050 BAU deforestation scenario (future precipitation and MCWD were based on six leading general circulation models at a resolution of 2.5 arc min with projections until 2070 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario; Fig. S1). Using the future climate (TAP and MCWD) predictions, we then identified and tallied the areas within the lowland Amazon forest that have analogous current climates. We then calculated the relative reduction (% decrease) in the number of current climate analogs corresponding to each cell due to the loss of area under current (2002) and predicted future (2050 BAU) deforestation.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found that current deforestation reduces the extent of climate analogs (i.e., the extent of populations that will be available to populate future Amazonian forests) by an average of 16% (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0004">4</a>A) and that future deforestation will reduce the extent of climate analogs by an additional 36% (Fig. 
  <a rid="ece31645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" href="#ece31645-fig-0004">4</a>B). These results highlight the fact that because deforestation is occurring predominantly in the dry seasonal forest of the southern Amazon, and because the Amazon as a whole is predicted to become increasingly dry and seasonal, the effects of deforestation will extend well beyond its footprint. In other words, deforestation is reducing the number of drought‐resistant populations that can potentially immigrate into the increasingly widespread dry conditions that are analogous to conditions that are currently restricted to the southern Amazon.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our analyses are meant to highlight the potential importance of range edge populations in trees and hence the danger of losing these populations through deforestation. The actual effects of deforestation on species persistence under climate change will be highly species‐specific and will depend on many different factors including the degree of local adaptation, the overlap between the species' geographic ranges and deforestation, and the species' dispersal ability, including the ability to cross‐disturbed/modified habitats (Feeley and Rehm 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0017">2012</a>; Urban 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0069">2015</a>). Understanding what important genetic traits are lost during human disturbance at forest ecotones can be an important component of understanding forest regeneration and dynamics under future climates, especially as deforested areas are abandoned and allowed to regrow (Chazdon et al. 
  <a rid="ece31645-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" href="#ece31645-bib-0009">2009</a>).
