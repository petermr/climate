 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We quantified climate change equity, defined as the distribution of climate change benefits and burdens, using data from two publicly available datasets and national GDP data. National level data sets suffer from some weaknesses such as a lack of accounting for sub-national variability and scaling. Nonetheless, they are still highly useful as global metrics as they provide aggregated assessments at the national level, which is the most meaningful for international policy negotiations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We extracted data on national vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change from DARA’s Climate Vulnerability Monitor (CVM)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>. The CVM uses 22 climate vulnerability indicators across four impact areas (Environmental Disasters, Habitat Change, Health Impact, and Industry Stress) to evaluate the vulnerability of 184 countries to climate change impacts for the years 2010 and 2030. Each of the 22 indicators is individually aggregated from various data sources and models and then combined to determine a country’s overall climate vulnerability, measured by impact to share of GDP and mortality (as these impacts are comparable across the wide range of countries). The CVM calculates vulnerability projections for 2030 using human population growth, mortality and GDP predictions. The CVM uses five vulnerability categories (low, medium, high, severe and acute) which are determined using a mean absolute standard deviation method
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>. The CVM categories do not of course capture the full complexity of national climate vulnerability, as capturing this would require an impractical degree of data. However, we consider the 22 indicators used by the CVM as capturing a high enough level of complexity to provide a meaningful approximation of national vulnerability.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data on GHG emissions (by countries) were exported from the World Resource Institute’s (WRI) Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>, a database of national and international GHG emissions derived from multiple sources. The CAIT data set compiles data for the six main GHG gasses (carbon dioxide (CO
  <sub>2</sub>), methane (CH
  <sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N
  <sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF
  <sub>6</sub>)) from 185 countries over the period from 1990–2012. We used the 2010 data for this study to match the CVM vulnerability data. The WRI compiled GHG data from UNFCCC reports and complemented with data from several NGO sources
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>, including emissions data from six major sectors (Land Use Change &amp; Forestry, Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture, Waste, and International Bunkers) and several subsectors. The CAIT data set reports at the national level, however we extrapolated per capita emissions results by dividing data by 2010 and 2030 population data from the World Bank
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a> (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S4</a> online).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We excluded the ten countries (Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Montenegro, Nauru, Niue, Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis, Serbia, Somalia and Taiwan) with data missing in any dataset, and 179 remained for analysis. In addition, there were also insufficient data available for many of the world’s island and archipelagic countries. Given the negligible GHG emissions and high climate change vulnerability of such countries, the majority are highly likely to qualify as climate forced riders
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" href="#b29">29</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" href="#b30">30</a> and as such, we expect that climate forced rider countries are likely underrepresented in our results. National GDP (measured in Current US$) was extracted from the World Bank Group
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" href="#b28">28</a>, who measure GDP as the gross value of all resident producers in an economy plus taxes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We created a Lorenz curve to represent the variation of GHG emissions among countries using the CAIT dataset, and calculated the Gini index to measure inequity in GHG emissions among countries, and the Robin hood index to measure how much of the total global emissions would have to be redistributed to achieve equity among countries (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a> online).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We compared the CAIT GHG data and the CVM vulnerability data both in 2010 and 2030 to assess whether the most heavily polluting countries were also those least vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change. We divided the CAIT GHG emissions into quintiles, matching the CVM data, to enhance comparability between the datasets and enable visualisation of climate equity in the recent past (2010) and near future (2030). We placed the emissions quintiles on a scale between the highest (acute emissions) and the lowest (low emissions) emitting countries. We also tested the correlations between GHG emissions and GDP against vulnerability to climate change by treating vulnerability categories as ordinal data and undertaking spearman’s rho tests using R statistical software
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" href="#b31">31</a>. R has a computational limitation for p-values lower than 2.2e-16, as such, where values this small were reported we wrote “p = 0”. Additionally, we counted countries in each CVM category and compared them between each time period.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In common with other studies of inequity in climate change
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" href="#b32">32</a>, we used terminology from the economics literature to define ‘free riders’ and ‘forced riders’
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" href="#b33">33</a>, recognising that a strict definition of these terms often applies only to situations where one agent’s use of a resource does not directly incur a cost to another agent. We define climate free riders as those countries in the ‘acute’ GHG emissions quintile and the ‘low’ vulnerability category, as they disproportionately receive benefits from climate change (via the national wellbeing generated by GHG emissions) but pay few costs in the sense they are the least vulnerable to negative climate change effects
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" href="#b34">34</a>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. Conversely, we define climate forced riders as those countries that fall within the ‘acute’ vulnerability category and the ‘low’ GHG emissions quintile, as they are the most susceptible to the negative consequences of climate change but receive the least benefits. Those countries that we define as equitable, fall in the same emissions quintile and vulnerability category (for example, low emissions quintile, low vulnerability category), as their emissions benefits are concomitant with their climate change burden.
