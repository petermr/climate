 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenhouse gas emissions are spread highly unevenly across the world’s countries (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>), with the top ten GHG emitting countries generating &gt;60% of total emissions, and three countries, China (21.1%), the United States of America (14.1%) and India (5.2%) being by far the largest contributors. A Gini coefficient of 80.9 indicated extreme inequality in the distribution of emissions among countries, given that the index can only vary between 0 (perfectly even responsibility) and 100 (one country responsible for all emissions)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>. A Robin Hood index of 64 indicated that 64% of GHG emissions would need to be redistributed to achieve an even distribution among countries
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>. Vulnerability to the impacts of climate change was also unevenly spread among countries, with 17 countries acutely vulnerable to climate change impacts in 2010 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). The majority of these were island countries located in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans (n = 7, 35.3%) and African countries (n = 8, 47%). By 2030 the number of acutely vulnerable countries is predicted to rise dramatically (n = 62; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>), and the majority of these will again be island (n = 20, 32.8%) and African (n = 27, 44.2%) countries.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Countries least vulnerable to the impacts of climate change were generally the highest GHG emitters, and conversely those most vulnerable to climate change were the least responsible for its genesis. This inequity held true for both 2010 and 2030, with a negative relationship between emissions and climate vulnerability in both years (2010: ρ = −0.4, n = 175, p = 0; 2030: ρ = −0.37, n = 175, p = 0). The only exception is in 2030, where countries acutely vulnerable to climate change will have slightly higher average emissions than those in the severe category (2030: severe = 48.83 mtCO
  <sub>2</sub>e, acute = 103.13 mtCO
  <sub>2</sub>e).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2010, of the 179 countries assessed, 28 (15.6%) were in the same quintile for GHG emissions and vulnerability to the negative impacts of climate change. This indicates that their vulnerability to climate change approximately matched their relative contribution to its genesis (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>). Ninety countries (50.3%) had GHG emissions in a higher quintile than their 2010 climate vulnerability, and 20 (11.2%) countries were free riders, with GHG emissions in the highest quintile and climate vulnerability in the lowest quintile (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S4</a> online). Sixty-one (34%) countries had GHG emissions in a lower quintile than their climate vulnerability, and six (3.4%) countries were forced riders, with GHG emissions in the lowest quintile and climate vulnerability in the highest quintile (Comoros, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S4</a> online).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 2030, climate change inequity will rise further, with an increase in the proportion of countries that are forced riders (n = 20; 11.2%), but fewer free riders (n = 16; 8.9%) and equitable countries (n = 23; 12.8%; see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S4</a> online). Free riders are typically located in the world’s sub-tropical and temperate regions, while forced riders are frequently located in tropical regions (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Greenhouse gas emissions were positively correlated with GDP (2010: ρ = 0.84, n = 175, p = 0; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>), while climate vulnerability declined with increasing GDP (2010: ρ = −0.69, n = 175, p = 0; 2030: ρ = −0.65, n = 175, p = 0; 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2d</a>). Our analysis considers the absolute contribution of each country to climate change, but we also examined climate change equity in per capita terms to provide a more complete picture of emissions responsibilities. The patterns were broadly similar, with, for example, Australia, Russia and the United States of America remaining free riders (see 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</a> online). However, several populous major emitters (e.g. United Kingdom, China, and Brazil) were no longer categorised as free riders.
