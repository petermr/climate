 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A total of 17 ecologically relevant temperature metrics were computed for each shore. Metrics were computed per year and then averaged over the four years of data available. Metrics computed include the mean using all available data for each shore (grand mean), the mean temperature during the hottest/coldest seven days of each year (‘mean 7d’), and the mean daily range of temperatures (‘daily range’), mean daily range of all microhabitats’ maximum temperatures (i.e., microhabitat range, or ‘micro range’), minimum, 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile, mean, 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile and maximum during the hottest/coldest 30 days of each year. For easier terminology, metrics computed during the hottest periods were prefixed “summer”, and metrics computed during the coldest periods were prefixed “winter” (e.g., ‘summer minimum’, ‘winter mean 7d’, etc.). The correlation coefficient between each metric and latitude was also calculated.
