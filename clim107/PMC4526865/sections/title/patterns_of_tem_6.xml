 <p>(
  <span class="bold">a</span>) Locations surveyed. Geographic pattern of metrics: (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) grand mean, (
  <span class="bold">c</span>) 7 day mean, (
  <span class="bold">d</span>) daily range, (
  <span class="bold">e</span>) microhabitat range, (
  <span class="bold">f</span>) minimum, (
  <span class="bold">g</span>) 5
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile, (
  <span class="bold">h</span>) mean, (
  <span class="bold">i</span>) 95
  <span class="sup">th</span> percentile, (
  <span class="bold">j</span>) maximum. Black line (
  <span class="bold">b</span>) is grand mean, calculated using all data from each shore. Red and blue lines (
  <span class="bold">c–j</span>) calculated using the warmest and coldest 30 days of each year (7 days for (
  <span class="bold">c</span>)), per shore. The shaded area is the pattern expected if each metric was perfectly correlated with latitude. Points in shaded area are “cooler than expected given latitude”, and points outside shaded area are “hotter than expected”. Correlation coefficients between each metric and latitude are depicted in the top right corner of each panel (blue for cold and red for warm periods). Map created in R
