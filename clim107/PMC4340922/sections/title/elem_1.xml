 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scientific consensus that human activities are the primary driver of global climate change is now unequivocal. This consensus is found not only in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref001" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref001">1</a>], but also by several different studies, including surveys of experts [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref002" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref002">2</a>] and comprehensive reviews of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref003" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref003">3</a>] [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref004" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref004">4</a>] [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref005">5</a>]. All of these methods converge on the same basic conclusion: at least 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref006">6</a>].
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, although a scientific consensus on this basic fact has been reached, much of the public remains largely unaware of this, both in the US as well as internationally [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref007">7</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref008">8</a>]. For example, only one in ten Americans (12%) correctly estimate scientific agreement at 90% or higher [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref007">7</a>]. Moreover, influential ideological and politically-motivated actors, also known as “manufacturers of doubt”, publicly dispute the existence of the scientific consensus [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref009">9</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref010">10</a>], including recent media articles such as the “Myth of the Climate Change 97%” [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref011">11</a>]. These efforts to undermine public understanding of the scientific consensus have arguably been quite successful, with cascading effects on public understanding that climate change is happening, human caused, a serious threat, and in turn, support for climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of the growing ideological divide on the issue [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref012">12</a>] (paired with people’s tendency to selectively process information), some scholars have argued that merely educating the public about the scientific consensus is unlikely to be a helpful approach [
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref013">13</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0118489.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref014">14</a>]. To better understand how people think, process and respond to the scientific consensus message, this study investigates a “gateway belief model” (GBM) of public responses to climate change.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Gateway Belief Model (GBM)</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perceived expert consensus plays an important role in the formation of public attitudes towards and the acceptance of general scientific principles, including climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref015">15</a>, 
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref016" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref016">16</a>]. In fact, misperceptions of the scientific consensus can be highly consequential, as even a small amount of perceived scientific dissent can undermine public support [
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref017">17</a>]. For example, a recent nationally representative study [
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref018" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref018">18</a>] found that the degree of perceived scientific agreement influences key beliefs about global warming, which in turn, drive public support for climate change policies. McCright, Dunlap &amp; Xiao [
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref019" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref019">19</a>] successfully replicated these results in a recent independent study and similarly point to the robust role of perceived scientific agreement in generating public support for climate change policies.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet, past research in this area suffers from one major short-coming: the bulk of these findings are based on cross-sectional survey data and thus correlational in nature. To date, there have been no controlled representative experiments (or longitudinal studies) investigating the proposed causal relationship between public perceptions of the scientific consensus on climate change and support for public action. This study builds upon and extends prior research in a novel direction by directly testing the “gateway belief” model experimentally. We posit that belief or disbelief in the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change plays an important role in the formation of public opinion on the issue. This is consistent with prior research, which has found that highlighting scientific consensus increases belief in human-caused climate change [
   <a rid="pone.0118489.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0118489.ref015">15</a>]. More specifically, we posit perceived scientific agreement as a “gateway belief” that either supports or undermines other key beliefs about climate change, which in turn, influence support for public action. A schematic overview of the “gateway belief model” is presented in 
   <a rid="pone.0118489.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0118489.g001">Fig. 1</a>. Specifically, we hypothesize that an experimentally induced 
   <span class="italic">change</span> in the level of perceived consensus is causally associated with a subsequent 
   <span class="italic">change</span> in the belief that climate change is (a) happening, (b) human-caused, and (c) how much people worry about the issue (
   <span class="italic">H1</span>). In turn, a change in these key beliefs is subsequently expected to lead to a 
   <span class="italic">change</span> in respondents’ support for societal action on climate change (
   <span class="italic">H2</span>). Thus, while the model predicts that the perceived level of scientific agreement acts as a key psychological motivator, its effect on support for action is assumed to be fully mediated by key beliefs about climate change (
   <span class="italic">H3</span>).
