  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We could georeference 403 caves for 83 of the 85 species of the clade (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1</a>), with a maximum number of 104 caves for the same species (
   <span class="italic">Troglocharinus ferreri</span> (Reitter)), and up to 3 species known from the same cave. The temperatures of the caves occupied by the species of the studied clade ranged from ca. 1–3 °C in some species of 
   <span class="italic">Trapezodirus</span> to just above 16 °C in 
   <span class="italic">T. ferreri</span>, with an estimated divergence between these two taxa and their most recent common ancestor of ca. 10MY (see 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</a> and 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Table S2</a>). The average temperature range to which each of the studied cave species are currently exposed is ca. 3 °C, with a maximum value of 7.2 °C for 
   <span class="italic">Trapezodirus bolivari</span> (Escalera) (from 2.40–9.60 °C; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S3</a>). The estimated ranges for the reconstructed LGM temperatures of the same caves were very similar (maximum value, also with 
   <span class="italic">T. bolivari</span>, (from −2.50–4.7 °C; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For most species, bioclimatic models showed that suitable temperatures (defined as temperatures within the range they currently experience) during the LGM were estimated to occur in karst areas separated from their current ranges by non-suitable habitat patches, that is, by areas without deep subterranean environment. Only 7 species had a locality (37 localities in total) with an estimated LGM temperature within the range of their current temperatures. In some cases, suitable conditions were even non-existent in the whole northeast Iberian Peninsula, as for example the coastal species of 
   <span class="italic">Troglocharinus</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a>). To track localities within their current range of temperatures these species would have had to disperse through areas considered to be unsuitable, without subterranean environment, in some cases well outside the current distribution of the whole clade. It can thus be safely concluded that to survive through the LGM (and likely at least several previous glacial periods) most species had to withstand temperatures outside the range they currently experience.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reconstruction of the minimum temperature change in the phylogeny using current or estimated LGM temperatures were almost indistinguishable (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3</a>), with a difference between 4.4–5.5 °C. This difference was not homogeneously distributed through the phylogeny, with the species under warmer current conditions having experienced a narrower historical range of temperature change (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</a>). Only 19 localities of 7 different species were estimated to have been at average below zero temperatures during the LGM (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). All but three of these 7 species are known from additional close localities estimated to have been above zero during the LGM.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the A2 scenario of climate change (see Methods), in 2080 only 9% of the extant localities would remain at temperatures within the current range of their respective species; this percentage was raised to 26% under the B2 scenario (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f1" href="#f1">Fig. 1c</a>,d; 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S2</a>). This translates into a maximum of either 26 or 48 species predicted to have at least one population with suitable temperatures for the A2 and B2 scenarios respectively, and only 8 or 16 species with more than 50% of their current populations predicted to have suitable temperatures in 2080.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mean rate of minimum absolute temperature change across all the branches of the tree was 0.76 °C/MY. The species that experienced the overall fastest minimum rate of absolute thermal niche change when considering only current conditions was 
   <span class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</span> (Fresneda, Hernando &amp; Lagar), with an average of 0.84 °C/MY (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f3" href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). The branch of the tree with the highest absolute rate of thermal niche change was found in 
   <span class="italic">Speonomus longicornis</span> (Saulcy), with a rate of 3.62 °C/MY (from 9.42–8.2 °C in the last 0.33MY). The fastest rate of change when considering only a temperature increase was 2.28 °C/MY in a terminal branch of 
   <span class="italic">Speonomus fagniezi</span> Jeannel (from 10.9–12.9 °C in 0.87MY). When we considered the estimated LGM paleotemperatures of the areas currently occupied by the species, the maximum rate of thermal niche change was found in a population of 
   <span class="italic">Trapezodirus orobios</span>, from 4.4 °C to 10.4 °C in the 21,000 years since the estimation used for the LGM (i.e., 0.029 °C/100 years).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The IPCC estimated rates are 3–4 °C for mean annual temperature in the next ~100 years, depending on location (IPCC 2007). The minimum rate of change estimated among the species of the clade, even considering the constraint of Quaternary glaciations, was then between ~10,000 and ~100 times slower than the expected rate of change from 2000–2100.</p>
