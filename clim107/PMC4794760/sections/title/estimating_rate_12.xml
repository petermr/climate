 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To estimate the minimum rates of thermal niche change that the species must have experienced we used three measures: i) average rate of thermal niche change, calculated as the average rate of all branches connecting all the specimens of each species with the root of the tree. For each branch, rate evolution was calculated as the absolute difference between the reconstructed initial and final temperatures divided by the length of the branch. ii) Maximum per-branch rate of thermal niche change, or the highest per-branch reconstructed rate among all the branches of the tree. iii) Adjusted LGM rate of change, calculated as the difference between the estimated paleotemperatures of the areas occupied by the species during the LGM (21,000 YBP) and the current temperatures. This range was estimated according to our conclusion that the species experienced this variation

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We also estimated how many of the current localities in which each species occur would have suitable thermal conditions in 2080 (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2d,h</a>), following the same procedure as before but projecting the thermal niche of each species to the predicted temperature for 2080 according to the B2 and A2 scenarios for the CCCMA-CGCM2 climate model through the CIAT database (
