 <div class="title">Using mesocosms to parameterize and refine climate-biodiversity models.</div>
 <p>Mesocosm experiments can be used to improve predictions of the impact of climate change on individual species and whole communities by parameterizing metapopulation and metacommunity models and by testing and refining population and community ecology theory. The figure is described in detail in
