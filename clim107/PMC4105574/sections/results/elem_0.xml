 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results from our multilevel random-intercept model are presented in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="pone-0103180-t001" href="#pone-0103180-t001">Table 1</a>. As predicted, distance from the coast significantly predicted decreased levels of belief in climate change (b = −.038, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .004) and lower levels of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b = −.036, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .005). These unstandardized coefficients indicate that for every additional 10 km from the coast that residents live, they are likely to be .038 units lower in their belief in climate change, and .036 units lower in their support for government regulation of carbon emissions. Considering that ratings of the two outcomes ranged from a minimum possible value of 1 to a maximum of 7 (a total of 6 units), our model therefore indicates that someone who lives 100 km from the coastline will be on average .38 units lower in their belief in climate change [.38 = 10 * .038], or roughly 6.3% of the total possible scale range lower [6.33 = (.38/6) * 100], compared to someone who lives by the coastline. In New Zealand, the maximum distance from the coastline a person could reside is approximately 177 km. The effect of proximity is relatively small, but still statistically significant even considering the small geographical area of the country.

     <span class="italic">Note</span>. Income was measured in units of $NZ 10,000. Distance from respondent address to nearest point on coast was scored in 10 km units. Height above sea level was scored in meter units. Distance to coastline, height above sea level, distance x height interaction, and regional deprivation were modelled at the between-region level, all other predictors were modelled at the within-region level.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These associations between distance to the coast and the outcome variables held in statistical significance and size in the extended model when also adjusting for the regional level of deprivation, height above sea level, and the interaction between distance and height. The model also included respondents' sex, age, education, household income and political orientation as predictors of the within-cluster variance in the outcome variables. Critically, this indicates that the focal association between proximity to the coast and the climate outcome variables was not moderated by height above sea level, and was not due to the fact that those in wealthier neighborhoods tend to live closer to the sea (shoreline areas in our sample were on average less deprived, 
  <span class="italic">r</span> = −.04, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;.01) and tend to have a higher belief in climate change. Indeed, with regard to regional deprivation, our results showed the opposite pattern of effects. Respondents who lived in more deprived areas were more likely to both believe in climate change (b = .056, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;.001) and support government regulation of carbon emissions (b = .037, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;.001).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of effects at the individual level (or Level 1 unit of analysis), education level and household income were not statistically associated with our outcome variables, while sex and political orientation exerted the strongest influence on both climate change belief and support for government regulation of carbon emissions.

  <a rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0103180-Zelezny1">[48]</a>, political conservatism predicted lower levels of belief in climate change (b = −.148, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .010) and lower levels of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b = −.164, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .004), men showed decreased levels of belief in climate change (b = −.426, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .001) and a lower level of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b = −.498, 
  <span class="italic">p</span>&lt;.001), and age was significantly associated with climate change belief (b = −.012, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> = .011), with older respondents tending to show less belief about the reality of climate change. The relative strength of the proximity effect (b = −.038 and b = −.036) was low in comparison with sex and political orientation, and it was slightly lower than the effect of regional deprivation, but our results indicate that distance to coast was significantly associated with climate change belief and support for emissions regulation.
