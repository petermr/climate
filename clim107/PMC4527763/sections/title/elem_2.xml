 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Charles Sturt University Human Ethics Committee provided ethics approval for the survey work which involved an online questionnaire. By administering this questionnaire, we surveyed 1,927 Australian respondents selected from a panel of respondents provided by the Online Research Unit (ORU). A two-stage probabilistic sampling procedure was used, which involved initial use of random sampling within the sample frame, but then additional random sampling within specific sections of the sample frame to ensure representativeness of the population across gender and age. The final sample excludes incomplete responses and those who rushed the survey (completed in less than 8 minutes).</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparison of the socio-demographics of the sample and the Australian population confirmed that the sampling procedure ensured that the sample corresponded closely with the population statistics. The mean age in the sample was 47.37 years (population 45.31 years), gender in the sample was 48.95% male (population 48.82%) and gross weekly family income in the sample was $1,432 (population $1,407) [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first stage of our analysis involved identifying climate change segments. We used the same 36 questions in the questionnaire as the Maibach et al. [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref010">10</a>] survey. Consistent with the main analysis in the ‘six-America’s study’ [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref010">10</a>], we used Latent Class Analysis to derive segments. We identified the same six segments as Maibach et al. that differ in their attitudes and behaviors towards climate change. Thus the method of segmentation is driven by respondents’ attitudes and behavior with respect to climate change. The six segments are: 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Concerned</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Cautious</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Disengaged</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Doubtful</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span>. The 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> segment are the most concerned about climate change, and the 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span> segment are the least concerned and generally do not believe that it is occurring. A comparison between the segmentation results from Maibach et al.’s [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref010">10</a>] study and our segmentation results is presented in 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0134868.t001">Table 1</a>. The key result was that compared with the US, there are fewer in the 
  <span class="italic">Alarmed</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Concerned</span> segments in Australia, about the same proportion in the 
  <span class="italic">Doubtful</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dismissive</span> segments, and consequently a much higher proportion in the 
  <span class="italic">Cautious</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Disengaged</span> segments. As discussed further in [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref032">32</a>], this seemed to indicate that there was much scope to develop majority support for climate policy in Australia by focusing on these middle two groups.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second we examined how segment membership differed across religious affiliations. To do this we included a question about religious affiliation. For those who identified as belonging to one of the Christian denominations, we grouped them according to whether they belonged to a denomination that generally treats the bible as being the literal truth (i.e. believe in biblical inerrancy), and those denominations that do not. Although there is useful work that has been conducted in the US showing the degree to which members of different denominations believe in biblical inerrancy [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref033">33</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref034">34</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref035" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref035">35</a>], there is less research on this issue in Australia [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref036">36</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref037" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref037">37</a>]. Consequently, the following classification of literal and non-literal Christian denominations in Australia is based on this literature combined with various publications of the National Church Life Survey [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref038" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref038">38</a>]. Denominations that were treated as having a literal view of scripture included Baptist, Presbyterian, Church of Christ, Lutheran, Evangelical and Pentocostal churches. Denominations treated as not having a literal view of scripture were: Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican and Uniting (a merger of Methodist, Congregational and many of the Presbyterian churches across Australia in 1977) churches. (A few Anglican dioceses (e.g. Sydney) teach a literal view of scripture. However, as these dioceses make up less than 20% of all dioceses within Australia, Anglicans were treated as being non-literal.) Finally, those religious groups which had fewer than 15 respondents identifying as belonging to them were excluded from further analysis. This had the effect of removing Jews, Muslims and some minor religious groups from the analysis.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third we examined how key climate change beliefs differed across religious groups. These beliefs were whether or not: climate change was occurring, climate change was caused by humans, climate change was of personal importance, one’s own mitigation actions were effective, efforts to reduce global warming (given associated costs) were desirable and Australia should act to reduce climate change emissions before other larger developed and developing countries have begun to do so.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous research has shown that associations between religious affiliation and environmental attitude can be spurious (e.g. [
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref014">14</a>, 
  <a rid="pone.0134868.ref017" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0134868.ref017">17</a>]) and simply reflect other socio-demographic and attitudinal variables. To correct for this possibility and to isolate the effect of religion on segment membership, we ran a series of ordered logit regressions that predict segment membership on the basis of religion, as well as key socio-demographic and attitudinal variables. The ordered logit model is commonly specified as follows:

This included questions such as “The hole in the ozone layer is a major climate change issue”, “Today, generating electricity from renewable sources (such as solar and wind) costs about the same as generating electricity from coal” and “The greenhouse effect is caused by heat from the sun being trapped by the atmosphere”. In addition, as climate change segment membership is likely to be influenced by environmental attitude, we also included in our questionnaire Dunlap et al.’s [
