 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A literature review to identify indicators of health care facility resiliency to climate change was conducted in September and October 2012 and used to inform development of the assessment checklist. Peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1 January 2003 and October 2012 was retrieved using a standard search strategy based on keywords related to:

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Separate searches were conducted to identify relevant articles describing resiliency in terms of emergency management and environmental sustainability. Keywords were used in the literature searches to capture the climate-related stimulus (e.g., climate change, global warming, extreme weather, heat, cold, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, wildfires, flooding, storms, drought, water-, food-, vector-, rodent-borne disease), entity impacted or impact type (e.g., hospital, health care facility, food service, supply chain, health care, morbidity, mortality, disease, infrastructure damage), emergency management (e.g. plan, evacuation, prevention, recovery, response) and/or environmental sustainability (e.g., greening, green, recycle, reduce, reuse, waste management). The following databases were searched: EMBASE, Global Health and Ovid Medline. A total of 2,342 peer-reviewed journal articles were identified and titles and abstracts were scanned for relevance. Articles were retrieved and further included for analysis if they were written in English and had information pertinent to the Canadian context (developed countries). Articles that did not directly address indicators of health care resiliency to climate change were excluded, with 34 peer reviewed articles remaining. In addition, a total of 30 grey literature reports were included, which were retrieved from various government (e.g., World Health Organization, Department of Health in the United Kingdom, Health Canada) and non-government websites (e.g., Health Care Without Harm, Centre for Excellence in Emergency Preparedness). The sixty-four references included in this study that informed development of the assessment checklist can be found in the
