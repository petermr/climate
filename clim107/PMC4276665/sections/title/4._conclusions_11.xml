 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study contributes to a growing evidence base of practical information to help health care facilities adapt to climate change. Application of the health care facility resiliency assessment toolkit can supplement existing hazard identification and assessment processes, support the development and enhancement of emergency management and health care services programs and support engagement of partners in efforts to address climate change risks and build community resilience. The toolkit also highlights the importance of investing in environmentally sustainable measures to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, improve the state of the environment and human health.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future efforts should be made to develop a more comprehensive best practices guidebook and incorporate a scoring component to enable facility officials to track progress overtime. Similar tools could also be developed for smaller or more specialized health care facilities as needed.</p>
