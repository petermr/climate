  <p>Baseline climate (1980–2010) is shown in black, future climate for the 2080s is shown in white, and their overlap is shown in gray. Future climate is represented by three general circulation models: CanESM2 (Can), CCSM4 (CCSM), and GFDL-CM3 (GFDL), and two emissions scenarios (top row = RCP 4.5 and bottom row = RCP 8.5).</p>
