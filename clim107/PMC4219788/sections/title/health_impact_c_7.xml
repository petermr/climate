 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The literature search identified three studies estimating economic damages or savings resulting from multiple diseases
  <a rid="b4-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-ehi-8-2014-043">4</a>,
  <a rid="b11-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-ehi-8-2014-043">11</a>,
  <a rid="b12-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12-ehi-8-2014-043">12</a> and seven studies estimating the economic damages from single health risks associated with climate change (including heat-waves and 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>) in Europe.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bosello et al use the general equilibrium Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to estimate, among other impacts, the health-care costs of treating climate change-attributed cases and labor productivity impacts of six disease groups for each world region.
  <a rid="b11-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11-ehi-8-2014-043">11</a> For the European regions, the study included cardiovascular, respiratory, and diarrheal diseases for the year 2050. The paper does not report if it valued the future economic impacts in present values using discounting. The study predicts 176,000 net deaths avoided from higher temperatures, which are valued at a saving of €38 billion annually in the EU area, and 284,000 annual deaths avoided in former Soviet Union (FSU) countries valued at a saving of €4 billion. The significantly lower economic value in FSU countries for a higher number of deaths avoided is because the estimation of the value of life is based on GDP per capita, which is significantly lower in FSU countries. The net reductions in death in temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere are due to the avoidance of cold-related cardiovascular death exceeding the increase in heat-related deaths. However, there is no assessment of winners and losers, by demographic or geographical group within each of the eight world regions. Using a computable general equilibrium model to assess economy-wide impact of the global health effects, the study reports that the negative impact on GDP is greater than the sum of the costs associated with the three diseases because of their impacts on other economic activities.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kovats et al estimate the welfare costs of heat mortality and salmonellosis cases in 27 EU countries.
  <a rid="b12-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12-ehi-8-2014-043">12</a> Under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario (medium–high emission trajectory, leading to central estimates of global average surface temperatures of around 3–4 °C relative to pre-industrial levels), the authors use two alternative units of health impact to value the lives lost from these two risk factors: the number of life years lost because of premature mortality and the number of premature deaths. The economic value of a “life year” is derived from that of a premature death, and is a fraction of the latter. When valuing life years lost, the marginal impact of climate change alone is €0.8 billion by the 2020s, €2.8 billion by the 2050s, and €4.0 billion by the 2080s; using the numbers of deaths, the marginal impact of climate change alone is €31 billion by the 2020s, €103 billion by the 2050s, and €147 billion by the 2080s. The 30-fold difference in valuation methodologies is accounted for by the fact that the two risk factors brought forward death by an average of just a few months. Kovats et al also estimate the economic costs of additional cases of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span>.
  <a rid="b12-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12-ehi-8-2014-043">12</a> Under the A1B scenario and assuming a decreasing case rate, the estimated annual costs without adaptation because of climate change are €29.5 million/year by the 2020s (2011–2040), €46.4 million/year by the 2050s (2041–2070), and €48.9 million/year by the 2080s (2071–2100). If the case rate is held constant, the corresponding annual costs are €36, €68.4, and €88.8 million/year. Additionally, the study estimates the costs of fatalities from coastal flooding, with a marginal impact of climate change costing €34 million by the 2020s (2011–2040), €122 million by the 2050s (2041–2070), and €720 million by the 2080s (2071–2100).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The study “Projection of economic impacts of climate change in sectors of the European Union based on bottom-up analysis” (PESETA) predicts almost 107,000 extra heat-related deaths per year in 2071–2100 for 27 EU Member States under a global mean temperature increase of 3.9 °C, compared to the baseline period 1961–1990.
  <a rid="b4-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-ehi-8-2014-043">4</a> In 2080, the value of excess deaths is estimated at €50 billion annually (when valuing each excess death) and €118 billion (when valuing the loss of a year of life). The greatest impact is in central southern Europe. These impacts are, however, likely to be balanced out by reduced cold-related deaths, with the greatest gains in northern Europe and the United Kingdom. For food-borne diseases, the PESETA study estimates that the average annual number of temperature-related cases of 
  <span class="italic">Salmonella</span> may have increased by a total of almost 20,000 as a result of climate change in Europe, leading to annual costs of €70–€140 million between the years 2011 and 2040, based on a cost per case of €3,500 and €7,000, respectively.
  <a rid="b4-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b4-ehi-8-2014-043">4</a> These unit costs were based on a review of studies that ask potential beneficiaries what they would be willing to pay to avoid food-borne disease. Under climate scenario A2, these cases and costs are predicted to double for the period 2071–2100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies estimate the climate change-attributable impact on single diseases in specific countries. For example, the application in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of a WHO Toolkit for the estimation of health and adaptation costs related to climate change focused on morbidity and mortality from heat-waves in the capital city, Skopje.
  <a rid="b13-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13-ehi-8-2014-043">13</a> Over a 5-year period from 2006 to 2010, the study estimated an annual average of 316 additional cases of cardiovascular disease and 344 additional cases of respiratory disease attributable to climate change, with 13 and 1 deaths resulting, respectively. The estimated average cost resulting over the 5-year period was €1.03 million per year or €2.5 per inhabitant of Skopje. Similarly in Germany, Hübler et al estimated the costs of heat-induced health effects in terms of hospital admissions; but the greater impact is the impact of heat on work performance resulting in an estimated output loss of 0.1–0.5% of GDP.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the project “Climate change and adaptation strategies for human health in Europe” (cCASh), a contingent valuation survey was carried out to estimate the benefits of reducing the risk of dying during heat-waves. In contingent valuation, a survey questionnaire builds theoretical scenarios to enable values to be obtained for situations that do not commonly arise in real-life, or cannot easily be observed. The survey was administered to adults aged from 30 to 75 years in the Czech Republic and Italy. For the city of Rome, the monetized mortality damages of the heat-waves in the absence of planned adaptation programs was estimated to be €281 million for the year 2020 (in 2004 values).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other studies estimate the costs of excess deaths from heat-waves, but do not estimate attributed costs to climate change, such as the 2003 heat-wave in the United Kingdom that led to 2,157 excess deaths at a cost of £2.6 billion (€3.6 billion) using valuation of a death at £1.2 million (€1.7 million), or £32 million (€45 million) using valuation of a saved year of life of £15,000 (€21,000).
  <a rid="b21-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b21-ehi-8-2014-043">21</a> In all, 1,650 excess hospital admissions were estimated to cost £15 million (€21 million), at an upper threshold of £9,120 (€12,770) per admission. Likewise, the 2003 heat-wave in France was estimated to have caused 14,800 excess deaths from August 1 to 20, 2003, costing society more than €500 million using a value per life saved of €37,500.
  <a rid="b22-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b22-ehi-8-2014-043">22</a> Both studies assume an average of 1 year of life lost per deceased person given that the majority of excess deaths were of people 75 years and over. Furthermore, the absence of a surge in health insurance expenses for the year 2003 in France led the authors to conclude that the increased hospitalizations from excess cases balanced out with hospitalizations averted because of excess deaths in the same year.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For air pollution-related deaths, the attributed cost of acute and chronic mortality to climate change was estimated by the Climate Cost project at €125 billion per annum in 2050 for the 27 European Union countries.
  <a rid="b16-ehi-8-2014-043" ref-type="bibr" href="#b16-ehi-8-2014-043">16</a> These costs are dominated by premature death (€86 billion), with the majority of the remaining accounted for by the cost of chronic bronchitis (€17 billion), restricted activity days (lost productivity at €14 billion), and suffering from disease symptoms (at €9 billion). One-third (€42 billion) of the overall economic impacts can be reduced by mitigation measures.
