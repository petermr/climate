   <span class="italic">orientalis</span> and current climate data, we generated geographic distribution maps predicting areas where

   <span class="italic">orientalis</span> might occur. The model performance for 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">orientalis</span> was better than random (AUC = 0.952); thus, the model performed well in predicting the suitable habitat area for the species. Our “maximum training sensitivity plus specificity” threshold value of 0.257 was obtained from the 10th percentile training presence occurrences of the species. The suitable habitat areas for 
   <span class="italic">P</span>. 
   <span class="italic">orientalis</span> were divided by these calculations into three categories: (i) 0.257–0.400, which included low habitat suitability areas that we color-coded green; (ii) 0.400–0.600, which included areas of moderate habitat suitability that we color-coded yellow; and (iii) 0.600–1.000, which included highly habitat suitable areas that we color-coded red. We constructed geographic distribution maps predicting areas where
