 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on known occurrences of 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> and current climate data, we generated geographic distribution maps predicting areas where 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> might occur. The model performance for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> was better than random (AUC = 0.952); thus, the model performed well in predicting the suitable habitat area for the species. Our “maximum training sensitivity plus specificity” threshold value of 0.257 was obtained from the 10th percentile training presence occurrences of the species. The suitable habitat areas for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> were divided by these calculations into three categories: (i) 0.257–0.400, which included low habitat suitability areas that we color-coded green; (ii) 0.400–0.600, which included areas of moderate habitat suitability that we color-coded yellow; and (iii) 0.600–1.000, which included highly habitat suitable areas that we color-coded red. We constructed geographic distribution maps predicting areas where 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> might occur (
  <a rid="pone.0132326.g001" ref-type="fig" href="#pone.0132326.g001">Fig 1A</a>). Currently suitable habitat areas for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> were predicted to occur in the southern part of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, eastern Gansu, eastern Sichuan, north–central Yunnan, northern Guangdong, and Guangxi. The predicted areas of suitable habitat for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> were continuous and spanned the region from northern to southern sectors of China. The current areas suitable for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> were predicted to encompass ca. 4.2×10
  <span class="sup">6</span> km
  <span class="sup">2</span>.
