 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on Maxent modeling, we identified a broad habitat for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> under current climate conditions. The projected distribution matches well the extant range of the species across most of eastern part of China. Annual temperature, monthly minimum ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), wet-day frequency, and monthly maximum UV-B were important factors shaping the habitat availability for this species. Our model predicted that the shift of habitat to higher latitudes and elevations will become gradually more significant during climate warming intensification, while the species abundance in low-latitude regions will decrease. The projected spatial and temporal pattern of range shifts for 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">orientalis</span> will be a useful reference in developing forest management and conservation strategies for this ecologically important species.
