  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Delphi process consisted of two rounds and was completed in 2012. In 
   <span class="bold">Round 1</span>: the Communiqué comprising the workshop delegates’ priorities, a participant information sheet and a semi-structured questionnaire were emailed to an international sample of experts who had not attended the workshop. The questionnaire asked participants to: (i) state what, if any, broad research priority areas they believed were missing from the Communiqué; and (ii) suggest at least one but no more than three priority research questions that would address one or more knowledge deficits in the overlap between climate change and NCD prevention and which would be feasible to conduct (see questionnaire at 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-12941-s001" href="#ijerph-12-12941-s001">Figure S3</a>).
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 
   <span class="bold">Round 2</span> questionnaire consisted of the responses to Round 1 after removal of duplicates and arranged in categories. It was emailed with an explanatory letter and instructions to respondents from Round 1 who were asked to either: (i) exclude or include the priority research areas identified in Round 1; and (ii) to rank each included question as either high, medium or low priority (see questionnaire at 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ijerph-12-12941-s001" href="#ijerph-12-12941-s001">Figure S4</a>). Specifically, participants were requested to identify those areas and questions that: 
   <div list-type="simple" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>were of central importance to the global response to NCD prevention and climate change;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>addressed a knowledge or evidence deficit that is preventing progress in an area of high importance to the overlap between mitigating or adapting to climate change and preventing or significantly reducing the impact of NCDs and/or which focused on social and health justice issues;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>addressed problems at the interface between NCDs and climate change which may be amenable to modification through legal interventions;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>had a degree of urgency or immediacy.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2.4. Analysis</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two of the authors (SB and RC) reviewed the responses to Round 1, removed duplicates and collated the remaining responses under 13 categories: food production; food security; policy; corporate social responsibility; urban design, transport and housing; regulatory interventions; social justice; economics; trade; behaviour and communication; information; systems; and water. The responses were then assessed for quality and consistency by three academic experts in health policy and law, sociology and politics from Bristol University (UK) who had attended the workshop. The categories were further condensed and each of the 100 questions gleaned from Round 1 was allocated to one only of six categories: food systems and security; urban design, transport and housing; economics trade and business; social justice; behaviour, communication and information systems; and regulation, governance and policy, which formed the structure of the Round 2 questionnaire.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Responses from Round 2 were entered onto an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed by the: 
   <div list-type="simple" class="list">
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>majority agreement to include as a 
      <span class="italic">high</span> priority;
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
     <p>ranking of order of importance as a

    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
     <span class="label">-</span>
