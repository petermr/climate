  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conduct a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment, including short- to long-term adaptation needs in the context of development priorities</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and others have published guidance on conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment.
   <a rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib9">9</a>, 
   <a rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib10">10</a> Many countries have conducted some form of a vulnerability and adaptation assessment, although few are comprehensive. An example of a comprehensive assessment is one conducted for Kiribati, a low-lying, resource-poor Pacific atoll nation.
   <a rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib11">
    <span class="sup">11</span>
   </a> The process assessed risks to health and sources of vulnerability. The high-priority adaptation needs identified included policies and programs to improve management of water safety and water-borne disease; food safety and food-borne diseases; and vector-borne diseases. Improving disease surveillance was also critical to managing most climate-related health risks in Kiribati.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Assessment of the risks of climate change is an iterative process rather than a one-off activity.
   <a rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib12">12</a>, 
   <a rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib13">13</a> Vulnerabilities are likely to shift as climate and development proceed, technologies advance, and new evidence and knowledge emerges on trends, projections, and best practices in adaptation. Therefore, conducting regular vulnerability and adaptation assessments that can then be incorporated into national adaptation plans is a recommendation in the H-NAP process.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strengthening health systems is the first area of focus for most national health adaptation plans to reduce the current burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Components of strengthening health systems include the essential public health services. Of particular importance are the following elements
   <a rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib14">14</a>, 
   <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">15</a>:

     <p>Building awareness of the health risks of climate change and the adaptation and mitigation actions needed to protect health today and in the future.</p>

  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Building the resilience of current and planned health programs includes strengthening coordination across departments in ministries of health mandated to manage climate-sensitive health outcomes (including vector-borne diseases, diarrheal diseases, food and water safety, noncommunicable diseases, and nutrition), and across ministries and departments whose policies and programs can affect these health outcomes. Coordination with sectors such as agriculture, water, and disaster risk management will facilitate identifying potential synergies and promote health co-benefits (see the example of Indonesia in a later section). For example, choices made on enhancing crop yields through irrigation or microdams could not only reduce food insecurity but could also provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, snails, and other disease vectors.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Develop a national health adaptation strategy that identifies priority adaptation plans</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The H-NAP should specify the priority strategies designed to address the adverse health risks of climate variability and change and include a detailed plan of action. Having a comprehensive vulnerability and adaptation assessment will facilitate developing strategies and implementation plans. Using a theory-of-change approach (eg, a process for defining how to achieve a long-term goal by identifying necessary early and immediate changes) can facilitate identification of priority strategies. Conducting a theory-of-change process includes working with stakeholders to identify the long-term change being sought; the process and sequence of change, including the socioeconomic and political conditions and the actors able to influence them; explicit statements of the assumptions about how change might happen; and a diagram and narrative summary of the process and expected outcome. The overarching strategy is generally to increase the resilience of health systems to the health risks of climate variability and change; this includes ensuring that health systems can prepare for, respond to, cope with, and recover from climate-related effects.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The H-NAP should include detailed institutional arrangements to implement and engage relevant stakeholders; immediate and medium- and long-term health adaptation goals, with a time frame for implementation; a monitoring and evaluation framework; and approaches to ensure adequate human and financial resources are available to implement the plan.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For example, African ministers of health and of environment have begun jointly implementing the framework for Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change.
   <a rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib15">
    <span class="sup">15</span>
   </a> The guiding principles are evidence-based planning, country ownership and community participation, intersectoral cooperation and collaboration, synergies with other public health initiatives, and advocacy at national and international levels. Implementation requires multisectoral Country Coordination Committees (CCCs), which are national technical and advisory entities intended to address health and environment issues—including climate change—that should include government representatives, development partners, and civil society. The proposed template for the adaptation plan includes risk and capacity assessment; capacity-building; integrated environment and health surveillance; response; research; monitoring and evaluation; and coordination and management. Following this process will put countries on pathways to become more resilient to the health risks of climate change.
