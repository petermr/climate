 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculated wheat yield with the M-GAEZ crop model
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. In this model, yield for each grid is determined not only by biophysical conditions including climate (1° × 1°) but also by management conditions including water management (rain-fed or irrigated) and input level, which is a collective indicator incorporating factors that affect yield (e.g., fertilization level, technological development level)
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. The input climatic variables are monthly mean temperature (°C), precipitation (mm/day), solar radiation (W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), wind speed (m/s), and diurnal temperature range (°C). The spatial resolution of final output yield is 2.5′ × 2.5′. To develop adaptation pathways, we aggregated grid-based yield into country-based yield.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The M-GAEZ model calculates wheat biomass based on the climatic variables, and it calculates wheat yield by imposing several constraints (e.g., a moisture constraint) and the harvest index on the biomass. The model also calculates the growing period of wheat based on the variety-specific growth cycle and climatic conditions, and judges whether the crop is able to grow or not based on the temperature profile in the grid cell during the growing period. In the M-GAEZ model, crops are assumed to be free from water stress when irrigation is applied; the negative impacts of a moisture deficit (related to evapotranspiration) can be fully avoided. (See Fischer 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" href="#b23">23</a> for further information of the model calculation.) Therefore, expanding the irrigated area as an adaptation has the potential to moderate a yield decrease. In addition, because the growth characteristics and suitable temperature profile differ among crop varieties, increasing the number of selectable varieties as an adaptation will increase the likelihood of attaining a higher yield.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At irrigation Level 0 (corresponding to no adaptation), the irrigated area is maintained as it is at present. To set irrigation from Levels 1 to 10, we increased the irrigated area ratio by 10% per adaptation level for crop lands where the present irrigated ratio is above zero. For Levels 11 and 12, in addition to increasing the ratio by 100% for crop lands where present irrigated ratio is above zero, we increased the ratio by 20% (for Level 11) and 50% (for Level 12) for presently non-irrigated crop lands (

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The M-GAEZ model originally had 16 varieties of wheat, which are classified into four major cultivars (winter wheat, spring wheat, wheat in subtropics, and wheat in tropics), each of which has four minor varieties that differ in growth period. At variety Level 0, only four minor varieties of the current optimal cultivar (defined as the major cultivar that most frequently produced the highest yield from 1991 to 2000) are selectable to obtain the highest yield. At variety Level 1, all the 16 original varieties are selectable. To assume new heat-tolerant varieties, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by relaxing the limitations of high temperatures for the 16 varieties. From Levels 2 to 5, a set of 16 new varieties become selectable when the level rises to the next one. We removed the limitations of high temperatures at Level 5 (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" href="#S1">Supplementary Table S1</a>); wheat is assumed to be free from the limitations of high temperatures within the suitable climatic zones. For all the calculations, the planting date was variable to produce the highest yield under the given adaptation set. The effect of CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization was taken into account by applying multipliers to the yield according to the mean atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentration in each decade, in a way similar to Masutomi 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" href="#b22">22</a>. (Note that the extent of the CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization effect has large uncertainties.)
