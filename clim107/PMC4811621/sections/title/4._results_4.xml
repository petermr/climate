  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> illustrates the simulated 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> for falciparum malaria on the African continent based on baseline climate. We observe distinct geographic patterns in the intensity of falciparum malaria. The transmission intensity is highest in the tropics as well as the coastal areas of East Africa. The subtropics exhibit low levels of transmission intensity. Our simulations fall within the observed spatial distribution of falciparum malaria on the continent described by Gething et al. [

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> shows the projected 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> for falciparum malaria in Africa based on HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk3 A2a climate scenarios for 2040. Compared to the simulations for the baseline climate, we observe increases in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> in the tropics, the highland regions, and East Africa as well as along the northern limit of falciparum malaria. By contrast, a decrease in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> is projected to occur on the southern fringe of the disease by 2040. These changes are similar for both HadCM3 and CSIRO Mk3 A2a climate projections.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> we notice that the increases in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> are sufficient to turn most areas in the African highlands into malaria endemic areas by 2040. The northern limit of falciparum malaria is also projected to become an endemic region.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, the decreases in 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub> are sufficient to turn areas that fringe the southern limit of the disease into malaria-free zones. A similar trend is expected for isolated areas in the African highlands as noted in
