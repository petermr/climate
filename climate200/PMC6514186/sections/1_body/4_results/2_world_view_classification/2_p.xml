<p>Participants were then classified as individualist, hierarchist, or egalitarian, based on a cluster analysis. A distance matrix using Euclidean distances between all participants was computed from the matrix of

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Everitt et al., 2011</xref>). The three-cluster level was selected to assign participants uniquely to one cluster, yielding an almost equal distribution of participants across clusters (individualism: 86, hierarchism: 90, and egalitarianism: 90). The mean scale value for each world view was computed for each cluster, and a cluster was labeled according to the maximum value of the world view scales (
