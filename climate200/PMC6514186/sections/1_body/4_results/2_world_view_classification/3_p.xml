<p>Individuals in each cluster are in fact mixtures of all world views. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> depicts the similarities of the participants in a two-dimensional plane (fitted via ordinal multidimensional scaling of the distance matrix), with the world view scales fitted as directional vectors (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Borg and Groenen, 2005</xref>). Each point represents a participant, and the projection of the point on a world view vector indicates how characteristic this world view is for this participant. The individualism and the hierarchism cluster appear as opposite to the egalitarianism cluster, and the hierarchism cluster shows substantial overlap with the individualists. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that Cluster 2 is the cluster with the highest score on the hierarchism scale, though this is still less than the scores on both the individualism and the egalitarianism scale for this cluster. Note that this cluster assignment serves the aim to construct a quasi-experimental factor discriminating participants according to the three world views as defined
