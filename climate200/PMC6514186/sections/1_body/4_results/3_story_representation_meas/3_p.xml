 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the cluster dendrograms for the Audience conditions. The control condition (pure recall) yields four discernable clusters (from left to right): A cluster with terms referring to the ‘chemical solution’ (CHEM for short), a cluster containing terms about the ‘free market’ solution (FM for short) and terms signifying ‘social crisis’ (CRIS for short), a cluster containing all protagonists of the story including their pitiful deaths (PROT for short), and a cluster representing the ‘sustainable solution’ (SUST for short). In an abbreviated form, we can write for the control condition
