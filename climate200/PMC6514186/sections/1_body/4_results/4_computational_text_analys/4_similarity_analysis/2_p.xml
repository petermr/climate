<p>As a measure of document similarity, we used the cosine similarity between two texts (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Thada and Jaglan, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">GÃ¼nther et al., 2015</xref>). The collection of terms from all text units constitutes the vocabulary of the text corpus. A single text can be represented as a vector of frequencies across the vocabulary, that is, for each term in the vocabulary, the vector indicates how often that term shows up in the text. The matrix of all text vectors, with the texts as rows and the terms as columns, represents the document-term matrix (DTM), which is used as the basic data structure. Given two documents with text vectors
