<p>We expected that recollections become less similar to the original story over time, due to time 
 <italic>per se</italic> (Hypothesis 1). Audience effects are expected to lead to higher similarity between the retelling and the original story in the control condition than when an audience exists (Hypothesis 3); if audience and speaker world views conform, reconstructive filtering is expected to be maximal, leading to particularly low similarity of the retelling to the original story (Hypothesis 2).
