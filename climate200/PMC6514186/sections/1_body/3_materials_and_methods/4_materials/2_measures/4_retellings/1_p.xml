<p>Each participant generated two recollections, the first 1 day after reading the original story, and the second after 1 week. Participants were asked to write down their recollection via keyboard in a text box shown on the screen. In the control condition, participants were asked to “write down how you remember the story, as completely as possible. It does not matter if you are uncertain about details.” Thus, the control condition constitutes a free recall task. In the treatment conditions, participants read a description of ca. 100 words of a person named Jon. Depending on the condition, Jon was portrayed as an egalitarian, a hierarchist, or an individualist (for full instructions see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>). After reading the description, participants were instructed to imagine what kind of person Jon is, and then asked to retell the story in a manner they would tell it if Jon were actually listening. The instruction and the full description of Jon were presented at both Stages 1 and 2. All three experimental conditions constitute a hypothetical social situation in which the participant as speaker (reteller) interacts with a particular type of listener (audience); control and treatment can be seen as contrasting a recalling with a retelling situation (
