<p>As controls, we measured transportation, that is, how seriously the story was read and how much participants were emotionally engaged. This was measured immediately after the story was read. Participants rated two questions: (a) ‘I was mentally involved in the story while reading it,’ and (b) ‘The story affected me emotionally’; both on a seven-point rating scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much).</p>
