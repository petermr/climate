<p>We assessed world view using a 20-item questionnaire in Norwegian adapted from 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Grendstad (2001</xref>; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Material</xref>). Each world view was measured by five items, yielding scales for individualism, hierarchism, egalitarianism, and fatalism. Based on all 20 items, participants were grouped via cluster analysis (hierarchical-agglomerative using Ward’s clustering algorithm) into three distinct clusters, corresponding roughly to the individualist, hierarchist, and egalitarian type. This one-to-one mapping of participant to world view serves as an approximation, in reality, most people do not represent pure types. Following 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Song (2014)</xref> we omitted the fatalism world view (see section “Climate Change Narratives and World Views”).
