<p>The experimental design is a 2 (Time) × 4 (Audience) × 3 (World View) three-factorial design, with a repeated measurement factor Time (two levels: Stage 1 and Stage 2), a between-subjects factor Audience (four levels: control, individualist, hierarchist, and egalitarian), and a quasi-experimental between-subjects factor World View (3 levels: individualism, hierarchism, and egalitarianism). Three types of dependent measures were taken: the recollected text served as the main dependent variable, a sorting task was used to measure the participants’ cognitive representation of the story, and a set of further rating scales were used to assess participants’ political orientation and attitude toward climate change.</p>
