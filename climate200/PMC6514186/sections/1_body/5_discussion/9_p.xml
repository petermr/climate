<p>We find, however, some suggestive indication of schema conformity, though contrary to our hypothesis. Although the interaction between Audience and World View is not significant, 
 <italic>F</italic>(6,254) = 1.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08, the interaction pattern suggests that identical world views of speaker and listener may increase story veridicality. When speaker’s and listener’s world views match, less filtering occurs and the narrative is more, rather than less, similar to the original story than when the world views of speaker and listener differ (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Clark and Brennan, 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Keysar et al., 1998</xref>), assuming that matching world views provide sufficient common ground for mutual understanding, making constructive processes and audience tuning superfluous. The motive to modify and adapt the recollection is low because no explanation or persuasion is needed and common ground is implicitly presumed. Interestingly, there is virtually no decline in similarity over time for the control/recall condition, suggesting that retelling to an audience not only decreases similarity due to audience tuning, but also makes the memory trace more fragile and amenable to deterioration over time.
