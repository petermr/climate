<p>In this study we examined processes of constructive memory (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wagoner, 2017</xref>) as one possible factor shaping peoples’ climate change narratives. World views, we assume, serve as cultural schemata that operate as filters when people recollect narrative information and share their narratives with others. World views filter meaningful components of a narrative, sifting out what is not compatible with one’s world view. World views also operate when telling stories to others, in the sense that stories are tuned to the world view of the audience.
