<p>The computational text analysis examined three hypotheses: first, a time effect was expected, that is, retellings were assumed to become less similar to the original story over time. Second, we expected a schema conformity effect, consisting of an audience effect and a speaker effect: Retellings were expected to become more similar to the speaker’s as well as to the audience’s world view, and consequently become less similar to the original story. Third, we expected that in the control group, retellings would be least affected by reconstruction processes, due to the absence of an audience.</p>
