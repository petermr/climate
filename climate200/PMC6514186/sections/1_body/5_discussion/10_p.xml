<p>Results of splitting up the story into its three story lines related to the three protagonists (Greene the egalitarian, Brown the hierarchist, and Wayne the individualist) are in line with the other findings. The control group yields largest similarities to all story characters, whereas the specific audience world views show no effect. However, an interesting interaction between story character and speakersâ€™ world view emerges: those participants who hold an egalitarian world view produce the most similar recollections with respect to all three central characters of the story (

This pattern might be due to the egalitarian world view being closest to the dominant politically correct view, as presumably seen by many people in Norway. A possible explanation could be that dominant world views operate as weak filters, generating little reconstructive modifications; conversely, minority world views might operate as strong filters and generate more substantial modifications and distortions.
