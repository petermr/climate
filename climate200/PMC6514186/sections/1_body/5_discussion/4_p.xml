<p>The focus of this study was on examining actual retellings, that is, texts generated by participants when asked to remember and retell a previously read narrative. We analyzed these natural language data by means of computational text analysis; specifically, we computed similarities between the retellings and the original story, between the retellings and partial aspects (story lines) of the story, and we computed the amount of specific world view-related topics occurring in the retellings via dictionary analysis (

In contrast, we attempted to quantify the main components of retold stories, and their interrelationships, aiming to capture important aspects of reconstructive processes. Additionally, we assessed the ensuing cognitive representation of the narrative by means of a more traditional sorting task method. Participants sorted the main terms from the narrative into groups, and a cluster analysis was employed to detect the underlying story representation from the derived co-occurrence matrices of terms.
