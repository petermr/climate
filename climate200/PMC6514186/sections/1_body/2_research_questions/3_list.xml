  <p>First, since reconstructive filtering implies simplification, we assume that over time stories will become simpler and thus less similar to the original story (
   <italic>time effect</italic>).
  </p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Second, a 
   <italic>schema conformity effect</italic> is expected: stories will adapt to the speaker’s world view (
   <italic>speaker effect</italic>) as well as to the audience’s world view (
   <italic>audience effect</italic>). In particular, if both world views match, this effect will be especially strong and might possibly account for an echo chamber phenomenon.

 <list-item>
  <p>Third, without an audience, retelling a story will basically be an isolated recall task; we assume that any filter mechanisms will apply to a significantly lesser degree in this situation compared to when an audience is present (
   <italic>control group</italic>).
