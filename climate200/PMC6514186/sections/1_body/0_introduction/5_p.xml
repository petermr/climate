<p>We report a study using methods from computational text analysis (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Welbers et al., 2017</xref>) to analyze participants’ recollections of a narrative about climate change. This study contributes to a growing line of research which uses natural language texts or open-ended textual responses, that is, ‘text as data’ rather than quantitative survey questions, to investigate how people understand and evaluate climate change (

Most research using text analysis employs a bottom-up approach, inducing regularities in massive collections of texts from online sources (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) by automated classification methods, such as clustering or topic modeling (
