<p>We conceive of world views as the primary cultural schemata that shape how people understand social issues such as climate change. We employ the typology proposed by cultural theory (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Douglas and Wildavsky, 1982</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Thompson et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Verweij et al., 2006</xref>) comprising four principal world views, each view representing a different stance concerning social relations and the relation between humans and nature: (i) The 
 <italic>egalitarian</italic> view considers nature as fragile and unstable, and humans as being responsible for behaving in a sustainable way; this view is associated with a more liberal/left political orientation. (ii) The 
 <italic>hierarchical</italic> view considers nature as basically stable, but vulnerable to human activities; a hierarchist relies on science and technical experts to solve problems and is moderately associated with a conservative political orientation. (iii) The 
 <italic>individualistic</italic> view considers nature as robust and stable and largely immune to human activities, as long as nobody and no higher power interferes; this view is associated with a conservative political orientation, favoring free-markets and individual freedom. (iv) The 
 <italic>fatalist</italic> view considers nature as well as society as unpredictable and humans as unable to influence the course of events; politically, a fatalist tends to be non-political and to refrain from political action, thinking that nothing can be done anyways. For variants on this typology see
