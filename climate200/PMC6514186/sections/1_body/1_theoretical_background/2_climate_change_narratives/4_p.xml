<p>Following 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Song (2014)</xref>, we retain this classic approach in our study because it has proven to be a useful typology in climate change research (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Song, 2014</xref>). We exclude the fatalist world view, for practical reasons and following an argument by 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Verweij et al. (2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Song, 2014</xref>) that fatalists do not consistently participate in public debate about climate change simply because they are fatalists, and thus do not form a coherent schema that may influence recollections.
