<p>Thus, retelling a story to an audience is quite different from recalling a memory in isolation (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Marsh, 2007</xref>). Retelling a story repeatedly alters the content and structure of the story progressively, because what is retold strengthens the memory traces of the retold information, and information that was not retold decays (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>). Repeated retelling makes the retold narrative increasingly coherent and conforming with the retellerâ€™s schema as well as with the audience schema; as a result, a retold story becomes simpler and its similarity to the original story or experience declines, while at the same time becoming increasingly coherent with respect to the endorsed cultural schemata. Echo chambers are a suitable metaphor describing this mutual reinforcing effect in the context of social media communities.
