<p>NECB exhibited high interannual variability but was consistently higher in the fast‐4FRI scenario than in the no‐harvest scenario for approximately 50 yr after initial treatment, indicating that an accelerated harvest schedule can increase carbon sink strength (Fig.

 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S11). Annual NECB values between the two scenarios converged in the last 40 yr when perhaps warmer temperatures and drier conditions in the hot/drier climate model (Appendix
