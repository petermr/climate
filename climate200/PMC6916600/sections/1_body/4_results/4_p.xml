<p>The harvested‐products analysis showed that ~5% of the harvested carbon remained sequestered in wood products at the end of our study, adding an additional ~53 g C/m
 <sup>2</sup> or 207,000 metric tons of carbon in the fast 4FRI scenario. In contrast, ~137,000 metric tons of carbon was emitted by the harvesting equipment and vehicles transporting the material off site. Thus, there was only a net gain of 70,000 metric tons of carbon from the harvested material, which represents only a fraction (~0.5%) of the carbon gains modeled in LANDIS‐II from the fast‐4FRI scenario (Table 
 <xref rid="eap1979-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Because these gains were so small, we did not include them in the overall total carbon storage for the landscape.
