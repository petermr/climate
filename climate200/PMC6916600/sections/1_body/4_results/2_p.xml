<p>Given that the relative changes in carbon pools and fluxes in the four climate models were similar, we present the remaining results only for the hot/drier climate model here because it resulted in intermediate carbon estimates. Results from additional models can be found in the supplementary materials. Under the hot/drier climate model, live carbon pools accounted for 52%, soil carbon pools accounted for about 40%, and dead carbon pools accounted for about 8% of the overall TEC differences between the fast‐4FRI and the no‐harvest scenario at the end of the simulation (Table

 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S6). By 2099, the no‐harvest scenario had 1.5 times more wildfire emissions and 33% less production than the fast‐4FRI scenario (Fig.

 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Figs. S7, S8). In terms of carbon fluxes, ~70% of the TEC increase in the fast‐4FRI relative to the no‐harvest scenario was explained by decreased wildfire emissions while greater production explained ~30%. In the fast‐4FRI scenario, ~22% of the area burned was burned at a high severity (moderate–high or high) compared to ~66% in the no‐harvest scenario (Fig.
