<p>Despite initial decreases in carbon in the first two decades due to accelerated harvest and prescribed fire, the moderate‐ and fast‐4FRI scenarios resulted in greater carbon storage by the end of the century than the status quo and no‐harvest scenarios and that pattern remained consistent among the climate models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Depending on the climate model, the overall increases in TEC for the fast‐4FRI scenario were 9–18% higher than the no‐harvest scenario, equating to an increase of 6.3 million–12.7 million metric tons of carbon across the 4FRI project area. Climate models that predicted the largest temperature increases by late century showed greater decreases in TEC in all restoration scenarios by the end of the century (Fig.
