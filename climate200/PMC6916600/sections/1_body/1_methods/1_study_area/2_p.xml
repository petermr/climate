<p>The elevation of the study area ranges from 1,780 to 3,850 m with a mean elevation of 2,190 m. The average temperature is 10.2°C and average annual precipitation is ~460 mm. The 4FRI landscape is dominated by contiguous ponderosa pine tree cover intermixed with lesser amounts of dry and wet mixed conifer forests types and oak. Ponderosa pine forests in this area have shifted from naturally open conditions to high densities of small diameter trees in the last century, due to fire suppression, harvesting, and episodic regeneration events (Covington and Moore
