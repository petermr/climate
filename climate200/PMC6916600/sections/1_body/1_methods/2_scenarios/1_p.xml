   <p>No Harvest/Control: In this scenario, we assumed no harvest or prescribed fire occurred in the project area for the entire length of the simulation. Wildfire was still simulated.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Status quo restoration: We estimated the current pace of restoration by averaging the area across which thinning and prescribed fire occurred in years 2010–2016. This included 1,200 ha of thinning and ˜3,600 ha of prescribed fire per year for a period of 20 yr followed by ˜3,600 ha of prescribed fire per year for the remaining 70 yr of the simulation (Table 
    <xref rid="eap1979-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

  <list-item>
   <p>Moderate pace of restoration: This included 12,000 ha of thinning and 7,000 ha of prescribed fire per year, such that entire project area was treated in a period of 20 yr, followed by 7,000 ha of prescribed fire per year for the remaining 70 yr of the simulation (Table 
    <xref rid="eap1979-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

   <p>Fast pace of restoration: This was an accelerated pace of restoration that closely matched 4FRI's target restoration pace. It included restoring the same area as the moderate pace of restoration but in half the time; 24,000 ha of thinning and 14,000 ha of prescribed fire per year for the first 10 yr followed by 14,000 ha of prescribed fire per year for the remaining 80 yr of the simulation (Table 
    <xref rid="eap1979-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
