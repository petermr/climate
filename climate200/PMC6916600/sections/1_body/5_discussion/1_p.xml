<p>Our results demonstrate that large‐scale forest restoration can increase the potential for carbon storage and stability and those benefits could increase as the pace of restoration accelerates. The fast‐4FRI scenario could increase total carbon storage by ~12.7 million metric tons over the no‐harvest scenario in the hot/drier climate model, equating to the removal of the annual emissions from 110,000 passenger vehicles or the electricity consumed in over 90,000 homes per year until the end of the century. Increases in ecosystem carbon were greater when the 4FRI program was completed in 10 yr vs. 20 yr.</p>
