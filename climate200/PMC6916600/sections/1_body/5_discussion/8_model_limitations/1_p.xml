<p>We found that ~40% of the increases in carbon storage occurred in soil carbon, a stable long‐term carbon pool that is less vulnerable to losses from forest disturbances (Scheller et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In LANDIS‐II, thinning, prescribed fire, and wildfire all add biomass to the dead pools of carbon on the landscape. Dead‐pool carbon quickly decomposes to become soil organic carbon and remains in soil carbon pools long term. However, there are limitations to the harvesting process used in LANDIS‐II because equal amounts of aboveground and belowground live carbon are removed from the system. Instead of transferring the belowground live carbon (roots) to the dead pools and eventually soil pools, the model removes the belowground pools from the ecosystem in the same way as aboveground live pools. This leads to fewer inputs into the dead pools and thus, fewer inputs into soil organic carbon, and a conservative estimate of the amount of carbon being stored in the soil. Additionally, black carbon is not accounted for in LANDIS‐II so it is not known how this would vary by scenario.
