<p>Climate change effects on forest carbon were most apparent in the last half of the century and these effects were more pronounced in the climate models that predicted hotter temperatures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In the hot/drier and hotter/wet climate models, ecosystem carbon decreased in the last half of the century likely because higher temperatures and/or less precipitation led to lower rates of growth and establishment (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S12) that could not keep pace with increased mortality from wildfire (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S13), maintenance prescribed fire, and tree senescence. This effect was greatest in the hotter/wet climate model that predicted a 9.7°C increase in summer temperature by the end of the century, suggesting that a ~10°C increase in summer temperature could represent a threshold where the effects from restoration are diminished or eliminated. This is demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b, where the slopes of the lines representing cumulative NEP for 4FRI scenarios and the no‐harvest scenario become similar in the last 30 yr of the century, and in Fig. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, where annual NECB values become similar and overall negative during the same time frame.
