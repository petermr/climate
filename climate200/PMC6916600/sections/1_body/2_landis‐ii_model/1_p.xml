<p>The LANDIS‐II model is a spatially explicit landscape model that simulates forest succession and disturbances, and tracks tree growth using species‐age cohorts rather than individual trees (Scheller et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Life history attributes are species‐specific model input parameters that inform how trees grow and compete. Species‐age cohort biomass is tracked in each active cell across the landscape. To simulate succession, we used LANDIS‐II v. 6.2 and the Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen (NECN) Succession extension (v. 4.2.4; formerly the Century Succession extension) that simulates monthly growth, mortality, and reproduction and also tracks carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling both above‐ and belowground (Scheller et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). For disturbances, we used the Biomass Harvest extension (v. 3.2.3) to simulate both thinning and prescribed fire and the Dynamic Fire and Dynamic Fuels extensions (v. 2.1) to simulate wildfire.
