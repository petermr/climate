<p>We ran 10 replicate simulations for each scenario and each GCM from 2010 to 2099 using an annual time step for all extensions. We conducted sensitivity analyses by evaluating aboveground biomass output averaged for 2, 5, and 10 replicates and found little difference between averages of 5 and 10 replicates; thus, we ran 10 replicates of each scenario. For each scenario/GCM, we evaluated total ecosystem carbon (TEC), individual pools of carbon (i.e., live carbon, dead carbon, and soil carbon), net ecosystem production (NEP), wildfire emissions, wildfire severity and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) at each time step and averaged across replicates. NEP is gross primary productivity minus ecosystem respiration with positive values indicating the landscape is acting as a sink for carbon and negative values indicating a source of carbon to the atmosphere. NECB is NEP minus carbon lost from fire and prescribed fire, with positive values indicating the landscape is acting as a sink for carbon and negative values indicating a source of carbon to the atmosphere. NECB also often includes carbon lost from thinning but, in this study, a separate analysis outside of LANDIS‐II was used to determine the fate of carbon post‐thinning and thus, the carbon storage/emissions from thinning (see harvested‐products analysis below) was not included in our NECB estimates. TEC values reported are those output from LANDIS‐II and do not include carbon that remains sequestered in harvested material.</p>
