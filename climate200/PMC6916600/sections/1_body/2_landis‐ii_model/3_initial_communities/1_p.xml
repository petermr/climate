<p>LANDIS‐II requires an initial communities input file that specifies the species and age cohorts for every cell on the landscape. We included 10 species in our model: ponderosa pine (
 <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>), aspen (
 <italic>Populus tremuloides</italic>), pinyon pine (
 <italic>Pinus edulis</italic>), juniper (we used four similar species in the genus 
 <italic>Juniperus</italic> that all occur in the region), Gambel oak (
 <italic>Quercus gambelii</italic>), white fir (
 <italic>Abies concolor</italic>), subalpine fir (
 <italic>Abies lasiocarpa</italic>), Engelmann spruce (
 <italic>Picea engelmannii</italic>), blue spruce (
 <italic>Picea pungens</italic>), and Douglas fir (
 <italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>). We created a raster layer with 100‐m grid cells and used USFS inventory data from the 4FRI project (USFS, 
 <italic>unpublished data</italic>) to assign an initial community to each cell. To do this, we developed diameter to age regressions for each of our species, based on USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service

Unique species–age cohort combinations were created and assigned to every cell on the landscape. Our study area was divided into 14 ecoregions based on a combination of soil texture/depth information derived from U.S. Forest Service soil surveys (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service
