<p>LANDIS‐II runs a model spin‐up for a length of time that is equal to the age of the oldest cohort, placing cohorts on the landscape in each time step corresponding to their current age. The oldest cohort in our initial communities layer was estimated to be 800 yr old, resulting in a model spin‐up time period of 800 yr. After model spin‐up, at year 0, we compared the biomass in each ecoregion from LANDIS‐II to the biomass at each ecoregion (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S4) from USFS data. LANDIS‐II biomass values were less variable than inventory data but the median LANDIS‐II biomass values in each ecoregion matched inventory data well, reliably falling within the interquartile range. As is common with LANDIS‐II, initial biomass values were slightly overestimated because spin‐up does not include disturbances (Scheller et al. 
 <xref rid="eap1979-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The average biomass from the inventory data (11,396 g/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and the average biomass from LANDIS‐II calibrations at year 0 (14,931 g/m
 <sup>2)</sup> were within expected bounds (Appendix 
 <xref rid="eap1979-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>: Fig. S4).
