 <caption> Total ecosystem carbon ( TEC) as output from LANDIS‐ II for the four climate models throughout the simulation model period. These values do not include estimates from carbon that remains sequestered in harvested products. Climate models are (a) INMCM (warm/dry); (b) BCC‐ CSM1‐1 (warmer/wetter); (c) IPSL CM5A LR (hot/drier); (d) MIROC ESM CHEM (hotter/wet). Values of change in precipitation (precip) and temperature (temp) are changes from the observation‐based 1981–1999 average to the modeled 2081–2099 average. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. </caption>
