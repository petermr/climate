 <caption> Pools of carbon that constitute total ecosystem carbon ( TEC) throughout the simulation model period for the hot/drier climate model ( IPSL CM5A LR). (a) Total live carbon includes aboveground (wood and leaves) and belowground (coarse and fine roots) live carbon; (b) total soil carbon includes all soil organic matter pools; (c) total dead carbon includes dead wood, dead leaves, and dead roots.
