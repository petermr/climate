 </sup>, we include both reward and punishment mechanisms in this model. A fixed group budget 
 <italic>Nδ</italic> (where 
 <italic>δ</italic> ≥ 0 stands for a per-capita incentive) is assumed to be available, of which a fraction 
 <italic>w</italic> is applied to a reward policy and the remaining 1-
 <italic>w</italic> to a punishment policy. We assume the effective impact of both policies to be equivalent, meaning that each unit spent will directly increase/decrease the payoff of a cooperator/defector by the same amount. For details on policies with different efficiencies, see Methods.
