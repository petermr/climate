<p id="Par16">The optimal procedure, however, is unlikely to be realistic in the context of Climate Change agreements. Indeed, and unlike other Public Goods Dilemmas, where Reward and Punishment constitute the main policies available for Institutions to foster cooperative collective action, in International Agreements it is widely recognized that Punishment is very difficult to implement

 </sup>. This has been, in fact, one of the main criticisms put forward in connection with Global Agreements on Climate Mitigation: They suffer from the lack of sanctioning mechanisms as it is practically impossible to enforce any type of sanctioning at a Global level. In this sense, the results obtained here by means of our dynamical, evolutionary approach, are gratifying, given these a-priori limitations of sanctioning in

Given that low-risk scenarios are more common and harmful to cooperation than high-risk ones, our results in connection with rewards provide a viable way to explore in the quest for establishing Global cooperative collective action. Reward policies may also be very relevant in scenarios where Climate Agreements are coupled with other International agreements from which parties are not interested to deviate from
