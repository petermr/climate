<p id="Par14">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates how the choice of the switching point 
 <italic>s</italic> impacts the overall cooperation, as evaluated by 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </sub>, for different values of risk. For a switching point of 
 <italic>s</italic> = 
 <italic>k</italic>/
 <italic>Z</italic> = 1.0 (0.0) a static policy of always pure-Reward (pure-Punishment) is used. This can be seen on the far right (left) of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> suggests that, for low thresholds, an optimal policy switching (which, for the parameters shown, occurs for 
 <italic>s</italic> = 50%, see Methods) is only marginally better than a policy solely based on rewards (
 <italic>s</italic> = 1). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> also allows for a comparison of what happens when the switching point occurs too late (excessive rewards) or too early (excessive sanctions) in a low-threshold scenario. A late switch is significantly less harmful than an early one. In other words, our results suggest that when the population configuration cannot be precisely observed, it is preferable to keep rewarding for longer. This said, whenever the perception of risk is high (an unlikely situation these days) an early switch is slightly less harmful than a late one. In the most difficult scenarios, where stringent coordination requirements (large 
 <italic>M</italic>) are combined with a low perception of risk (low 
 <italic>r</italic>), the adoption of a combined policy becomes necessary (see right panel of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
