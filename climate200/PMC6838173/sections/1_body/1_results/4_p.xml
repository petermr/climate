 </sup>, in the 
 <bold>CRD</bold> coordination and co-existence dynamics already exist in the absence of any reward/punishment incentive. Reward is particularly effective when cooperation is low (small 
 <italic>k/Z</italic>), showing a significant impact on the location of the finite population analogue of an unstable fixed point. Indeed, increasing 
 <italic>δ</italic> lowers the minimum number of cooperators required to reach the cooperative basin of attraction (as well as increasing the prevalence of cooperators in co-existence point on the right), which ultimately disappears for high 
 <italic>δ</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). This means that a smaller coordination effort is required before the population dynamics start to naturally favor the increase of cooperators. Once this initial barrier is surpassed, the population will naturally tend towards an equilibrium state, which does not improve appreciably under Reward. The opposite happens under Punishment. The location of the coordination point is little affected, yet once this barrier is overcome, the population will evolve towards a more favorable equilibrium (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Thus, while Reward seems to be particularly effective to bootstrap cooperation towards a more cooperative 
 <italic>basin of attraction</italic>, Punishment seems effective in sustaining high levels of cooperation.
