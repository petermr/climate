<p id="Par12">As a consequence, the most frequently observed configurations are very different when using each of the policies. As shown by the stationary distributions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C,D</xref>), under Reward the population visits more often states with intermediate values of cooperation (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., where 
 <bold>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </bold>s and 
 <bold>
  <italic>D</italic>
 </bold>s co-exist). Intuitively, this happens because the coordination effort is eased by the rewards, causing the population to effectively overcome it and reach the coexistence point (the equilibrium state with an intermediate amount of cooperators) thus spending most of the time near it. On the other hand, Punishment will not ease the coordination effort, and thus the population will spend most of the time in states of low cooperation, failing to overcome this barrier. Notwithstanding, once surpassed, the population will stabilize on higher states of cooperation. This is especially evident for high budgets, as shown with 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.
 <italic>02</italic> (blue line). Moreover, since 
 <italic>Nδ</italic> corresponds to a fixed total amount which is distributed by the existing cooperators/defectors, this causes the per-cooperator/defector budget to vary depending on the number of existing cooperators/defectors (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., each of the 
 <italic>j</italic> cooperators receives 
 <italic>wδN/j</italic> and each defector loses (1 − 
 <italic>w</italic>)
 <italic>δN/</italic>(
 <italic>N</italic> 
 <italic>−</italic> 
 <italic>j</italic>)). In other words, positive (negative) incentives become very profitable (or severe) if defection (cooperation) prevails within a group. In particular, whenever the budget is significant (see, 
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.02 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) the punishment becomes so high when there are few defectors within a group, that a new equilibrium emerges close to full cooperation.
