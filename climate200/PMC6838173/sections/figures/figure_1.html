 <caption> Average group achievement η G as a function of risk. Left: Group relative threshold M/N = 3/10. Right: Group relative threshold M/N = 7/10. In both panels, the black line corresponds to a reference scenario where no policy is applied. The red line shows η G in the case where all available budget is applied to pure-Punishment ( w = 0), whereas the blue line shows results for pure-Reward ( w = 1). Pure-Reward is most effective at low risk values, while pure-Punishment is marginally the most effective policy at high risk. These features are more pronounced for low relative thresholds (left panel), and only at high thresholds does pure-Punishment lead to a sizeable improvement with respect to pure-Reward. Finally, the orange line shows the results using the combination of Reward and Punishment, leading (naturally) to the best results. In this case, we adopt pure-Reward ( w = 1) when there are few cooperators and, above a certain critical point k/ Z =  s = 0.5, we switch to pure-Punishment ( w = 0). As detailed in the main text (see Fig.  3 and Methods), s = 0.5 provides the optimal switching point s* for cooperation to thrive. Other parameters: Population size Z = 50, group size N = 10, cost of cooperation c = 0.1, initial endowment B = 1, budget δ = 0.025, reward efficiency a = 1, punishment efficiency b = 1, intensity of selection β = 5, mutation rate µ = 0.01. </caption>
