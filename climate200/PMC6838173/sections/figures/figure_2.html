 <caption> Gradient of selection (top panels, A and B) and stationary distribution (bottom panels, C and D) for the different values of per-capita budget δ indicated, using either pure-Reward ( w = 1, left panels) or pure-Punishment ( w = 0, right panels). The black curve is equal on the left and right panels, since in this case δ = 0. As δ increases, the behaviour under Reward and Punishment is qualitatively similar, by displacing the (unstable) coordination equilibrium towards lower values of k/Z, while displacing the (stable) coexistence equilibrium towards higher values of k/Z. This happens, however, only for low values of δ. Indeed, by further increasing δ one observes very different behaviours under Reward and Punishment: Whereas under Punishment the equilibria are further moved apart (in accord with what happened for low δ) under Reward the coordination equilibrium disappears, and the overall dynamics becomes characterized by a single coexistence equilibrium which consistently shifts towards higher values of k/ Z with increasing δ. This difference in behaviour, in turn, has a dramatic impact in the overall prevalence of configurations achieved by the population dynamics, as shown by the stationary distributions: On panel C (pure-Reward) the population spends most of the time on intermediate states of cooperation. On panel D (pure-Punishment) the population spends most of the time on both extremes (high and low cooperation) but especially on low cooperation states. Other parameters: Z = 50, N = 10, M = 5, c = 0.1, B = 1, r = 0.5, a =  b = 1, β = 5 and µ = 0.01 (see Methods for details). </caption>
