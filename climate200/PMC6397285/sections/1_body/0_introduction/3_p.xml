 </sup>. Under the influence of global warming, permafrost temperature has evidently shown an increasing trend since 1980 in most parts of the NH
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. However, because of the spatial differences found in climate change itself, as well as the heterogeneity of soil properties, there remain regional differences in soil temperatures, permafrost boundaries and active layer thicknesses (ALT)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. A number of studies have reported these regional variations in the effects of global warming on the permafrost layer. For example, the temperature at a depth of 20 m in the permafrost has increased at a rate of 0.13 °C/a in northern Alaska since the 1980s
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. The temperature at a depth of 6 m in the permafrost increased by an amount between 0.12 °C and 0.67 °C on the high-altitude Qinghai–Tibet Plateau over the period 1996–2006
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. In northern Europe, permafrost temperature increased by an amount between 0.3 °C and 2 °C between 1971 and 2010
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Degradation of the permafrost has also been observed in many other regions, especially in Siberia, Sweden, Canada and Alaska

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. In Russia’s Vorkuta region, a permafrost layer 10 to 15 m thick melted completely between 1975 and 2005, and the southern limit of the permafrost shifted 80 km northwards
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. ALT deepened by approximately 20 cm in Russia between 1956 and 1990
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The lower altitudinal limit of mountain permafrost has risen by 25 m over the last 30 years at Xidatan in the interior of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau
