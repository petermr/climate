<p id="Par6">Previous studies have mainly focused on the permafrost projection in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century in different RCP scenarios. However, the relation between future permafrost extent and temperature rise at a specified threshold is still not fully addressed. This study focuses on what degree or how large in extent would the permafrost degradation response be to global warming under global temperature rise at risk-level thresholds of 1.5 °C, perhaps a maximum threshold of 2 °C. This is an important issue to the global community and is helpful for making adaptation and countermeasure policies.
