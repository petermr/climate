 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the present (1986–2005) permafrost extent estimated from the reanalysis data and the MME of the 17 CMIP5 models. Both estimations are in good agreement with the International Permafrost Association (IPA) data in most regions
 <sup>

 </sup>. Discrepancies between simulated and observed permafrost distributions are mainly located in northern Europe, southern west Siberia and the southern permafrost boundary in North America. The two datasets underestimate the permafrost area in western Siberia and the northern margin of Europe but overestimate the permafrost area on the southern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and in northern Mongolia. Comparing the permafrost extent estimated by the two datasets, the estimations based on the MME showed a better performance in the northern islands of North America than the estimations based on the reanalysis data. However, the estimations based on the MME underestimate the permafrost in southern North America, which may be related to the difference in permafrost extent between the two datasets. The permafrost areas in the NH estimated from the reanalysis datasets and climate model data are about 15.61 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 16.24 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. The latter is closer to IPA’s estimate of 16.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. However, because the 16.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup> figure excludes isolated and sporadic permafrost, the actual permafrost area in the NH is likely to be greater than 16.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>.
