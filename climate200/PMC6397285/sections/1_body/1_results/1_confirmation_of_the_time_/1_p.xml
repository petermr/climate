<p id="Par8">The determination of the period that corresponds to the thresholds of 1.5 °C and 2 °C rise in temperature is different under different models or different RCP scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.5 and 8.5). This determination is also closely dependent on the definition of the pre-industrial period. The periods 1861–1880, 1861–1900 and 1871–1900 have all been used as reference periods for the climate state in pre-industrial times in previous studies

 </sup>. Considering the difference in start times for the historical simulations in the various models, the average of 1861–1880 was used as the reference period in the present study, which is consistent with the approach of the IPCC

 </sup>. The MME indicates that the global average surface temperature during the pre-industrial period was approximately 14.2 °C. The data used for the analysis were the monthly surface temperature datasets from the 17 CMIP5 global climate models. Most of the models are able to reproduce the increase in surface temperature over the past 50 to 100 years

 </sup>. Because surface temperature does not necessarily continue to immediately rise once it reaches a threshold, we define the year that the global mean surface temperature reaches the 1.5 °C or and 2.0 °C threshold as follows: (1) the first year that reaches the threshold in ascending order of time and (2) the first year that reaches the threshold and is maintained for five consecutive years, similar to the approach of Zhang
