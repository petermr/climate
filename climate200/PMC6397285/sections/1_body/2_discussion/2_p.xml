<p id="Par14">The MME analysis showed that the year in which the 1.5 °C rise in global mean surface temperature would be reached would be 2027, 2026 and 2023, respectively, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. However, under RCP2.6, the global mean surface temperature would not reach the 2 °C threshold during the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, reaching only about 1.9 °C by 2100. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the 2 °C threshold is reached around the middle of the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century (2046 and 2037, respectively). Low radiative forcing would slow the temperature increase.
