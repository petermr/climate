<p id="Par19">The extent of the permafrost can be estimated with either indirect methods or direct methods. As indirect methods, we calculated the mean annual air temperature (MAAT), air frost index (F), surface frost index (SFI) and simplified permafrost models (e.g. Kudryavtsev). As direct methods, we diagnosed the temperature of soil layers (TSL) and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT). Although the simulated soil temperature from CMIP5 models or LSMs such as CLM4.5 can also be used in permafrost projection

 </sup>, it should be noted that freeze–thaw parameterizations in LSMs might not be perfect. First, most current land surface models are isothermal models and do not consider the interactions between thermal and hydrological processes, thus degrading the simulation performance of the LSM over permafrost regions. This issue and the corresponding parameterization development have been addressed by Wang and Yang

 </sup> in a recent work. Second, the parameterizations of the occurrence of soil freeze or thaw in current LSMs are not complete

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>, and cannot represent subgrid-scale permafrost distributions (e.g. sporadic and isolated permafrost)

 </sup>. Our results
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> also indicate that the simulations of the freezing–thawing process are not very consistent with observations and would greatly influence the calculation of permafrost extent. Third, since the soil layers in LSM are not uniform and the soil layers are different in different LSMs, it is difficult to directly compare the permafrost extent at the same depth. As a result, interpolation between the soil layers could cause uncertainty in the estimation of permafrost extent. Our preliminary numerical experiment based on CLM4.5 also indicates that CLM4.5 evidently underestimates the permafrost extent (not shown). The Kudryavtsev method is a classic and stable approach in permafrost simulation

 </sup>, which is mainly driven by climate variables (e.g. air temperature, soil moisture and snow depth) and considers the impacts of air temperature, vegetation, snow characteristics, soil texture and thermal properties on the permafrost rather than soil temperature only. Consequently, the Kudryavtsev method was used in this study.
