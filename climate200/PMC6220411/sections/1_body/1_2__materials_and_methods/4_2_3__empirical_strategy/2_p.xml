<p>Noting that 
 <italic>C</italic> varies plausibly randomly over time—i.e., “weather” draws from the county “climate” distribution—this approach resembles an experimental design and, therefore, 
 <italic>β</italic> identifies the causal effect of weather shocks on the incidence of LD [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fixed effects for county, 
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, absorb fixed spatial characteristics, whether observed or unobserved, disentangling the shock from many possible sources of omitted variable bias, such as geographic features (e.g., elevation and ruggedness) and county baseline economic characteristics (e.g., GDP, population, and number of hospital beds and number of physicians per 100,000 population) that are likely to be correlated to climatic variables. Time-fixed effects, 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, further neutralize any common trends and thus help ensure that the relationships of interest are identified from idiosyncratic local shocks. State-specific time trends, 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), are added to allow for differential trends in subsamples of the data, controlling for a number of observed and unobserved factors affecting the outcome of interest that vary over time at the state level, such as state health expenditures and state public awareness campaigns regarding the incidence of particular diseases. In our preferred specification of Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq1">1</xref>), 
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) is a quadratic function of time, that is, it includes state-specific quadratic time trends, as will be explained in more details in Results and Discussion.
