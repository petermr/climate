<p>A fundamental issue in Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq1">1</xref>) is regarding the functional form of 
 <italic>C</italic>. Following previous studies [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we use indicator variables for bins of annual average temperature and for bins of annual total precipitation. These bins are listed in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and were described in the data section. Thus, the only functional form restriction is that the impact of the annual average temperature on the incidence of LD is constant within 2°C intervals. The choice of narrow temperature bins represents an effort to allow the data, rather than parametric assumptions, to determine the incidence-temperature relationship, while also obtaining estimates that are precise enough that they have empirical content [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This degree of flexibility and freedom from parametric assumptions is only feasible because we are using 16 years of data from a large area of the United States. Similarly, we use simple indicator variables for precipitation based on annual rainfall in county 
 <italic>i</italic> in year 
 <italic>t</italic>. Each indicator corresponds to a 50-cm bin, ranging from less than 70 cm to more than 270 cm.
