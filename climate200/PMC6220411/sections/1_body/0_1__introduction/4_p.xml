<p>The major reservoirs for 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> are birds and small mammals such as mice and chipmunks [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While deer are not competent hosts for 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, they are essential for the 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> life cycle. The tick 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> has three stages of development: larva, nymph, and adult tick [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In North America, the life cycle of 
 <italic>I. scapularis</italic> takes approximately two years to complete [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Egg laying usually begins in May; hence, larvae are the most abundant during the summer. These larvae feed on small mammals such as the white footed mouse during summer, at which point transmission of 
 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> occurs. As the winter approaches, the tick larvae enter a dormant stage in which they stay throughout the winter. In the beginning of the spring of the second year, the larvae that survived the winter mold into the next stage of tick developmentâ€”nymph. During the spring/summer of the second year those nymphs seek suitable hosts for feeding, including humans. Following a bloody meal, the nymphs mold into adults. If an adult tick survives the winter, it will seek another host (usually a large mammal such as deer) on which it will feed and be able to lay eggs. At that point the two year life cycle is completed [
