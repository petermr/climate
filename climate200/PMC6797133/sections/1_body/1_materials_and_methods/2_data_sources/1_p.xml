<p>We compiled repeated-survey data from multiple sources to test for effects of elevation, time between surveys, and population size on extinction probability. The sources of these resurvey data were from an assessment of the conservation status of

 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> in California that reviewed available records (78 sites) for the species throughout that state [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] conducted on federal lands. Both resurvey data sources (205 populations combined) included sites revisited at least once and documented site location, elevation, population size, and years between surveys. We used information on population size from the first survey, and time between first and last surveys was calculated as the number of years between the first and last (most recent) survey. The last survey was used to score each population as either extant or extinct (no individual plants found at the site). The time between surveys ranged from 1 to 29 years. While most observers censused populations, some (particularly in the California portion of the data set) estimated population size, and when this occurred we used the highest integer reported for a population during the first survey. For example, if 50â€“100 plants were reported, we used 100 to be conservative. If the number was vague (e.g., 75+, &gt;30, or ca. 50) we used the actual integer listed (75, 30, or 50, respectively). Populations used in the analysis varied in size from 1 to 1084 individuals.
