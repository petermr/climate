<p>This study demonstrates the need for additional and more frequent surveys of rare plant populations to improve the reliability of information in databases used by land management agencies. Land managers who make decisions on how best to conserve rare species often base their decisions in part on the abundance and distribution of those organisms as reported in databases. However, many reported populations may no longer be extant. Managers should be aware that the number of populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an overestimate, and consider resurveying populations in databases to document their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of small populations, especially those at low elevations or other areas with high vulnerability to change in climate or land use. Species like

 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> may be candidates for assisted migration [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] as their low-elevation populations experience extinction and if expansion or colonization at higher elevation locations does not occur naturally. We suggest that development of propagation and planting techniques (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]) to allow for intervention is warranted, and needs to consider the fungal dependency of this rare orchid [
