 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In populations with declining growth rates, the rate of extinction will be even faster. Therefore, as time between surveys increases, population extinction should also increase, especially for small populations. Surprisingly, time between surveys had no significant effect on probability of extinction in eight rare plants in Germany [
