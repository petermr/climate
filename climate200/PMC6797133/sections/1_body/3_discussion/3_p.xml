<p>We speculate that negative impacts from climate change might already be apparent for

 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> through extinction of low elevation populations. Loss of low elevation populations may be expected when climates warm to the point that populations can no longer survive in the hotter portions of their range. For example, loss of butterfly species at low elevations has been attributed to warming trends in Spain [

 <italic>fasciculatum</italic> are generally consistent with orchid responses to climate change in North America and elsewhere. Documented declines of species in the Orchidaceae in eastern North America appear to be related, at least in part, to an inability of these species to alter their phenology, particularly flowering time, as climate has warmed over the last century and a half [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and orchids in general appear to be highly vulnerable to climate change in China [

And it is clear that climate has changed recently and is forecasted to change further in California and Oregon, in part due to warming and drying that, when combined, exacerbate moisture deficits and increased evaporative demand (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], but the lands on which this study derived its supporting data are public property that is remote, often difficult to access, and largely sheltered from development and urbanization. Also, the status of this plant as a sensitive species has led to the protection of most populations on public land from timber harvest, road building, and other land actions for the period of this study. Nitrogen deposition has also contributed to large scale landscape changes that affect plant distributions [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], but the populations examined here are not directly downwind from urban centers with high N production and receive most of their precipitation from low-N air masses blown in from the Pacific Ocean.
