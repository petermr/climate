<p>Resurveys of plant populations and communities can provide substantial insights into the nature and causes of changes that occur in the natural world over time [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] if the survey is not sufficiently thorough. The datasets we used contained information on population resurveys that were carefully conducted by trained botanists with precise location information, but the possibility remains that some extant populations may have been missed. This could be aggravated by individual plant dormancy, which would make plants very difficult to detect during surveys, and if all plants in a population were dormant at the same time–a possibility that increases as population size declines–whole extant but dormant populations could be falsely classified as extinct. Dormancy (years when no living tissue is visible above ground) is not uncommon in terrestrial orchids [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], including 
 <italic>Cypripedium</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cypripedium reginae</italic>, for example, may be dormant for up to four years [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. On the other hand, dormancy is associated with decreased orchid reproduction [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and if all individuals in a population were dormant, the population might already be close to extinction. These factors suggest that although we could have overestimated extinction probability [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] due to dormancy, this same dormancy could suggest increased plant vulnerability. Either way, we are unable to quantify this potential bias in our results given the available data.
