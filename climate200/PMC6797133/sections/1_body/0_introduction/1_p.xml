<p>Population extinctions are a major threat to plants, leading to range contractions, fragmentation and isolation (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), which together reduce the abundance of species. As Darwin [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] pointed out, rarity is a precursor of extinction. Orchids in particular face a global conservation risk with high species diversity but also a high rate of species that are rare or threatened with extinction [
