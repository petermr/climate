<p>Several processes can contribute to rare plant population extinctions, including habitat loss, interactions with invasive species, changes in disturbance frequency, etc. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Climate change in particular is affecting species ranges globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with organisms shifting toward higher latitudes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and elevations [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, plant ranges in western Europe have moved upslope at 29 m/decade over the last century [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and in California at similar rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Climate change effects on temperature and moisture may threaten plant diversity in Europe, especially in mountains [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Low-elevation populations of organisms can be especially at risk of extirpation as climatic conditions change and force upslope range shifts [
 <xref rid="pone.0210378.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Any contraction in the range of a rare species can have significant effects on its long term conservation and viability.
