<p>Taken together, climate change, population size, and time since observation create considerable uncertainty regarding the current status of wild plant populations recorded in various rare species databases. Several US agencies and organizations (e.g., US Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Forest Service, NatureServe, state Natural Heritage Programs) maintain databases of rare plant occurrences and many of these occurrences may not have been visited recently. Therefore, the number of populations in the wild of some species could be smaller than the number listed in databases due to extinctions that have not yet been detected. Increasing our ability to estimate the number of populations that remain extant or have gone extinct in these data bases will improve conservation planning for rare species. We used information on repeated surveys in California and Oregon for a rare but widespread orchid, 
 <italic>Cypripedium fasciculatum</italic> (clustered ladyâ€™s slipper), to test the hypothesis that extinction probability is affected by elevation, population size, and time since observation. We applied the resulting model to populations in land management databases in Oregon and California, specifically the Geographic Biotic Observations (GeoBOB) data base maintained by the US Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service Natural Resource Information System (NRIS-Terra), to estimate the number of populations that are still extant.
