<p>A total of 2415 populations with one or more plants were reported in the land management databases for Oregon and California. An additional 426 populations were reported as already extinct by 2016. Populations in those land management databases ranged in size from 1 to 1859 individuals, years between surveys from 1 to 115, and elevations from 234 to 1851 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210378.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The mean population size was 25 (95% CI ± 1.6). We estimated that of the 2415 populations reported as extant, only 1,317 (95% bootstrapped quantiles: 1,164–1,476) were likely still present. This is equivalent to an overall extinction rate of 45% (95% bootstrapped quantiles: 39%-52%). The predicted probability of population survival varied widely across the landscape in California and Oregon, with some population centers showing greater potential for population extinction than others (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210378.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For example, populations in southwestern Oregon had a predicted extinction rate of 57% (49%– 64%) of 1258 reports compared to 33% (25% - 41%) of 1157 records in California. This difference was driven in our model by the generally lower population sizes in Oregon (mean: 12.7 95% CI: ± 1.5) than California (37.9 ± 6.6) and lower elevations of populations in Oregon (757.2m ± 13.4m) than California (1319.2m ± 15.4m). Years between observations did not differ between states, averaging 15.4 years overall (± 0.39).
