<p>The four main elements in the innovation-diffusion model (Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) are new ideas or the innovation (in this article adaptation measures and correlated environmental risks), communication channels, time and the social system. Diffusion is facilitated through a communication process by which participantsâ€™ access and share information with one another to reach a mutual understanding, form attitudes and implement the idea. Forming attitudes towards an innovation is a mental process in the decision-making and implementation process (Rogers et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Disposition about ecological risks, risk behaviour outcomes and agency are thus akin to innovation-diffusion process. Risk communication can thus enhance adoption of positive risk behaviour and technology in the abatement of environmental and health risks (Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).
