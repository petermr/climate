<p>Risk communication focuses on information presentation, persuasion and strategic messages (Heath &amp; O’Hair 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Hence, it is critical in closing gaps between what is known by different actors about a particular risk and what needs to be known (Wardman 
 <xref rid="CIT0084" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). As knowledge offers insights as to how a system might be managed, farmer’s awareness, perception of environmental risks as well as risk behaviour can be used in modelling environmental impacts in adaptation to climate change. This has the potential in resolving the social-ecological-policy dilemmas. Risk communication can thus be viewed as an integral to risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and review planning frameworks for sustainable climate change action.
