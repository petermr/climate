 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Scoones 
 <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), participation improves the quality of decision-making process and improves use of available information and creativity in the society. Moreover, participation improves public understanding of the management issues at stake, enhances transparency in decision-making and might stimulate better coordination, monitoring and evaluation among government agencies. Participation increases better understanding, dialogue, out of thinking discipline, nuanced focus on relevant problems that confront the real drivers of change and formulation of strategy and policy (Mostert et al.
