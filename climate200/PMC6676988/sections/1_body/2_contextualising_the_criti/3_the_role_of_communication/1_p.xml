<p>The most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer benefits in the near future as well as reduce vulnerabilities in the long-term (Mimura et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Hence, adaptation to climate change requires supportive policy environment and support systems for resilience building. A supportive environment includes policies that improve access to quality services, leadership that promotes social and behavioural change among members of society, allocation of resources for social and behavioural change, community contribution to the implementation of solutions in general and support of individuals’ own behavioural change (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). This considers the interaction of individuals’ knowledge and behaviour on social change.
