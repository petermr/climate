<p>Advocacy, sustained publicity and education can converge value systems to reduce gaps in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>) as well as translate existing adaptive capacities into adaptation actions that reduce vulnerability (Mimura et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The backbone of advocacy whether national or at the local level comes from a combination of data analysis and community input (UNICEF 
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Possible results of an advocacy intervention can be targeted at leaders taking actions, such as legal reform, or enactment of new law(s), or rules, policy decisions, formulation of and/or reform, administrative directives resource mobilisation and financial allocation. In addition, the advocacy component can build the capacity of leaders to become advocates themselves and speak out on issues pertinent on funding priorities, policy change and addressing social barriers.
