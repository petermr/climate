<p>Empowerment refers to the capacity of people to make effective choices, envision alternatives, participate in decision-making, negotiate with influence, control and hold accountable institutions that affect their lives and livelihoods (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Accordingly, empowerment is central to community-based disaster risk reduction and resilience planning initiatives (UNISDR 
 <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) with communication being at the core of empowerment, participation and nurturing collective responsibility in climate change decision-making processes (Evans et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Servaes &amp; Lie 
 <xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The underlying philosophy in communication for development is built around the principle of empowerment in the identification of problems, development of solutions and implementation strategies, monitoring and evaluation (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>). This includes use of communication in extension education and research as a tool for improving productivity, incomes, welfare and sustainable natural resources management outcomes among farmers. For example, a democratic participatory approach that incorporates the interests, capacities and cultural identity of local communities at all levels has the potential to unpack the limitations of traditional media in empowering the community (Servaes &amp; Lie
