<p>The backbone of developing the social mobilisation component of a communication strategy comes from a combination of data, participant and behavioural analyses (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2010b</xref>; UNICEF 
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), as well as community input. Behaviour change communication involves face-to-face dialogue with individuals or groups to inform, motivate, problem-solve or plan with the objective of promoting and sustaining change (UNICEF 
 <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In agricultural extension and adoption of technologies, sustaining the change implies attaining a critical mass of adopters of a given desirable action (Rogers 
 <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), in this case ecological sustainability or package of technology that mediates ecological sustainability. According to public engagement conceptual framework (Devine-Wright 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), effective communication encompasses the understanding of communityâ€™s attitudes and believes. The integration of beliefs and attitudes, and the processes used in the assessment of economic, social and environmental dimensions or substantive sustainability, and procedural sustainability is thus relevant (Del Rio &amp; Burguillo 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
