<p>Water quality and its suitability for use in irrigation are judged on potential severity of problems that can be expected to develop during its long-term use (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Ravikumar &amp; Somashekar 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The most important determinants of quality and suitability of water for irrigation are total concentration of soluble salts (salinity hazard) in terms of electro-conductivity (EC), relative proportion of sodium to other principal cations (sodium hazard) expressed as sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), bicarbonate concentration relative to the concentration of calcium plus magnesium and boron hazards or concentration of boron or other toxic elements (Ravikumar &amp; Somashekar 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Salinity hazards or EC exceeding certain threshold levels reduce water availability to crop in the root zone. Salinity hazards above such thresholds could cause 8%â€“ 86% loss in crop yields (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>).
