<p>Climate change is the change in the state of climate whether because of natural variability or as a result of human activity that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Evidence of climate change includes changes in patterns of temperature and precipitation, irregular and un-predictable rainfall, intense downpours, rising temperature and generally increase in frequency of extreme and harsh weather such as droughts (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In realisation of the negative impacts of climate change, urgent action to combat climate change through adaptation has been proposed (UN 
 <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Accordingly, adaptation is a key factor that influences the future severity of climate change impacts (Easterling et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Adaptation to climate change takes place through adjustments to reduce vulnerability or enhance resilience in response to observed or expected changes in climate and associated extreme weather events. It involves changes in social and environmental processes, perceptions of climate risk, practices and functions to reduce potential damages or to realise new opportunities. Adaptation includes anticipatory and reactive actions (Adger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).
