<p>Salinisation is a major impediment in many arid and semi-arid regions of the world (Qadir, Qureshi &amp; Cheraghi 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The global extent of primary salt-affected soils is about 955 million hectares (ha), while secondary salinisation affects some 77m ha, with 58% of these in irrigated areas. Salinisation is attributed to irrigation of unsuitable soils or use of poor-quality irrigation water.
