<p>The utility of any integrative model in a dynamic socio-ecological environment to a great extend depends on its visibility and coherence (Lang &amp; Rayner 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Accordingly, in an attempt to bridge the gap between science and policy, increased attention on transdisciplinary paradigm and its variants have been advocated (Lang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). However, most of the existing transdisciplinary models are short in addressing cognitive failure. Though existing models, such as the nexus model, identifies relationships and interdependencies in environmental resource management, it fails to explain how risk and behaviour, compromise and negotiation can be achieved in creating interdependencies at planning and policy phases (Biggs et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
