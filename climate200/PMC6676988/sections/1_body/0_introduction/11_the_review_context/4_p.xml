<p>The crunch-release model (Blaikie et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) is a broad analytical framework on the causes of a disaster and disaster mitigation. The model espouses factors influencing vulnerability to a disaster by considering trigger events, elements at risk of damage or loss and vulnerable conditions both socio-ecological and physical, against actions that address underlying causes to achieve safe conditions or resilience. Developmental advocacy, policy and legislative actions, risk assessments, multi-hazards early-warning systems, public awareness and education and training (Satya 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) are among the disaster prevention and mitigation actions suggested in the model.
