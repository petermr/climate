<p>Disaster risk management involves strategic planning (Asghar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), administrative decisions and operational activities in the prevention, response, recovery, mitigation and early-warning for disasters (Satya 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Though the administrative activities are cross-cutting and a shared responsibility among various actors, the administrative decisions in agriculture are largely policy related while operational activities are largely farmer dependent. Risk reduction and resilience building at community level require analytical and conceptual lenses that unbundle cognitive biases and failures as well as integrate and transform individual and collective agency (Volenzo &amp; Odiyo 
 <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In farmersâ€™ use of irrigation as an adaptative measure to climate change, the critical question is on how to transform communities and individuals to collectively internalise the salinisation risks.
