<p>Taxonomic and functional richness were positively correlated for all times and scenarios (r &gt; 0.81, p &lt; 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons), indicating that cells with higher taxonomic richness usually also had higher functional richness. The highest values of functional richness calculated from the combined model, were found in the northeastern part of Murray-Darling Basin; in the Macintyre, Gwydir and Namoi Rivers despite these regions only having intermediate levels of Species Richness, as well in the southeastern part of the MDB, in the upper reaches of the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers (
