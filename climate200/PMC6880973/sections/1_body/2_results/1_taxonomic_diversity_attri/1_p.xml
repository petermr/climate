<p>Species richness predictions derived from the consensus model (CONS truncated by upper thermal tolerance limits of the species) identify the upper Murray River region as the richest in the basin (up to 16 species in a single cell) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225128.g002">Fig 2</xref>), emphasizing the high current climatic-environmental diversity within these drainages, and the suitability of this region for the ichthyofauna. Other catchments in the southeast of the basin (Lachlan and Murrumbidgee), southwest and northeast (e.g. Gwydir River catchment) have intermediate richness (up to 12 species). The rivers of the northwest presented the lowest ichthyofaunal richness (up to 6 species). However, future predictions produced by SDM’s and the physiological component revealed a marked loss of climatically suitable areas throughout much of the basin. The combined model suggests that the highest species richness will be restricted to a much reduced area in the southeastern upper Murray River and its major tributaries, with species losses intensifying toward the end of the century in the pessimistic scenario. In 2080 for RCP 8.5, the majority of richest cells tend to support only 5–6 fish species.
