<p>All functional traits had their value of contribution significantly diminished in the future scenarios (p &lt; 0.5) relative to present condition, as the results of IndVal showed (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225128.s001">S1 File</xref>). Catadromy was the most affected trait with no relevant contribution in any future time and carbon emission scenario, followed by amphidromy, vertical position non-benthic, herbivorous-detritivorous and omnivorous. Nonetheless, in relation to the contribution of each trait composing the future scenarios in proportion (%â€”
