<p>From a T matrix (traits x grid coordinates; using SYNCSA R package, function “matrix.t”–[
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], we performed the Indicator Value Analysis, which varies from 0 to 1 (IndVal; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]), using carbon emission scenarios as a factor with five different levels). IndVal identifies which traits are significantly increased or decreased in frequency in future scenarios. Good indicator traits would be those that are both abundant in a specific scenario (specificity) and predominantly found in a scenario (fidelity). Because we only used presence and absence, we only used fidelity. The statistical significance level adopted was α = 0.05, and these analyses were performed in R environment, using the package labdsv, function “indval” [
