<p>From the presence and absence matrices derived from the consensus model, functional diversity was calculated for each time and carbon emission scenario. Functional diversity was obtained from three indices: Functional Richness (FRic–[

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]), the Functional Uniqueness (FUni–[
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]). FRic represents the multidimensional volume occupied by the community and does not consider species’ abundances. FDis [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] is the mean distance weighted by abundance to the centroid (multivariate dispersion). For presence and absence data, where species have equal abundances, the Functional Dispersion is simply the mean distance to the centroid. Changes in FDis reflect changes in the species traits in relation to the center of functional space. FUni assumes that species with different traits perform distinct functions in the ecosystem. Thus, it is high when species have unique trait value combinations compared with each species of the pool (i.e. low redundancy). FUni (range 0 to 1) is the ratio between Rao’s entropy and the Simpson diversity index, relating observed functional diversity to the maximum value of dissimilarity of the community [
