<p>Indices were calculated in the R environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. FRic and FDis were calculated using the function “dbFD” (distance based on functional diversity) from the FD package, proposed by [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The traits matrix had mixed variables (continuous and categorical–see Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225128.s001">S1 File</xref>), so we used Gower’s dissimilarity with Cailliez’s correction [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] for negative eigenvalues. FUni was calculated from the function “uniqueness” from [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. All indices were calculated for each grid cell. The relationship between species richness and functional richness was evaluated through a Spearman correlation, since, according to the nature of this functional index, there is expected to be a high correlation between them [
