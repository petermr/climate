<p>The fish fauna of MDB consists of 46 native freshwater fish species and 11 introduced species (not included in the analysis). Of the 46 native species, 16 are found only in the Murray-Darling Basin [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The analyses were performed with fish occurrence records only from within the MDB; these were obtained from state government agency fish distribution databases (Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment and New South Wales Department of Fisheries) and sites surveyed as part of the Murray–Darling Basin Sustainable Rivers Audit [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We restricted our analysis to 4,347 sites surveyed between 1980 and 2010 for which reliable location and sampling information were available. Sampling involved a range of methods, including electrofishing and netting. In this study, we restricted analyses to those native species for which reliable information of functional traits and upper thermal tolerance limits are available (n = 23 species; see details below). Introduced species were excluded from all analyses. Occurrence records were mapped in a regular grid of 0.1° latitude and longitude (6,485 grid cells, each with approximately 11 km side and 120 km
 <sup>2</sup> area) with a buffer of 10 km from each side of the river network. For each species, a binary matrix of presence (1) and pseudo-absence (0) was constructed from the occurrence data, which formed the biotic component for the modeling. Considering that previous studies have demonstrated increasing precision of predictive models with increasing prevalence (i.e. proportion of occupied survey points; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], rare native species (i.e. those occupying &lt; 4 grid cells) were excluded from all analyses. The final dataset for modelling included 23 species (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225128.s001">S1 File</xref>) for which a total of 9,219 occurrence records were available (Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225128.s001">S1 File</xref>); this resulted in 4,275 occupied grid cells.
