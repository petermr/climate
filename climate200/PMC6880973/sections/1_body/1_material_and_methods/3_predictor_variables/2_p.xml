<p>We have chosen two years, 2050 (mid of the century) and 2080 (end of the century) to predict the future scenarios of climate change over the fish distribution. TMEAN, TMAX, TMIN, PANN, PMAX and PMIN for future scenarios were extracted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5). Our predictions involved four Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs): CSIRO (Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate), MRI (Meteorological Research Institute) and NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for further details). The greenhouse gas concentration trajectory for each AOGCMs were based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), from a moderate—RCP 4.5 
 <italic>stabilization</italic> to a pessimistic scenario—RCP 8.5 
 <italic>business-as-usual</italic> of carbon emission. The difference between them consist in the assumptions they use about population, economic growth, energy consumption and sources and land use over this 21

The term ‘‘stabilization” here means an intermediate scenario of accumulation of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere in future, rising until the mid of the century and after diminishing, and the term ‘‘pessimistic” means a scenario of high accumulation of greenhouse gases without efforts to contain the emissions [
