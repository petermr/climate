<p>Given that temperature tolerance limits are pivotal within the climate change context, we combined the correlative SDMs with independently derived estimates of the upper thermal tolerance of each fish species to further constrain species ranges estimates under each of the time (2050 and 2080) and carbon emission levels (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). The combined model generated for each species provides an environmental envelope truncated by the upper thermal tolerance limit (i.e. the lethal maximum temperature), furnishing a potentially more reliable delineation of the geographic distribution of each species. This constrained delineation is likely to help avoid false predictions, particularly regarding potential future range shifts. Thus, for each species, the final range was constructed from the presence-absence matrices generated by CONS model, keeping presences only in cells whose maximum temperature is tolerable by the species (TMAX minor or equal to the lethal maximum temperature). As the bioclimatic variable used was air temperature, we used the model relating air temperature and water temperature proposed by [
