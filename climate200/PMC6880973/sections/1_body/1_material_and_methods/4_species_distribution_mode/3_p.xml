<p>Our modeling protocol included six SDMs: BIOCLIM (BIOC; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]), Euclidian Distance (EUCD; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]), Gower Distance [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), Maximum Entropy (MAXE; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP; [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). These models represent a wide variation in predictions due to the variety of statistical techniques. All six rely on the use of species presence-only and presence-background data. Only results of the consensus models (CONS) were retained for interpretation which means if a model had not a good performance according the evaluation and validation methods below described, it was not included in the final model.
