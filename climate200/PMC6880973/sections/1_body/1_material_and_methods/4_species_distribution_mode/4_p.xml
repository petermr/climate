<p>The suitability matrices range from 0 to 1, in which values equal to 1 correspond to ideal habitat conditions and values equal to 0 correspond to suboptimal habitat conditions for the species [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For each SDM, the continuous suitability predictions were converted into binary vector (1/0) using a threshold that maximizes the sensitivity and specificity values in the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC curve; see Fielding and Bell 1997). The ROC curve is generated by plotting the fraction of true positives versus the fraction of false positives, at various threshold settings. The use of all possible thresholds avoids the need for a selection of a single threshold, which is often arbitrary. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is often used as a single threshold-independent measure for model performance [
