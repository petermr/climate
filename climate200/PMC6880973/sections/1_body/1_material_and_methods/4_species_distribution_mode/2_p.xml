<p>Given the conceptual and statistical particularities of different SDM approaches, a range of predictions can be generated, introducing uncertainty about which is the best model to represent the environmental suitability and the potential distribution of species [

 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). The main principle in using a consensus approach is that different sources of error affect each niche model in different ways, and the combination of its predictions tends to minimize errors and generate more robust predictions [
