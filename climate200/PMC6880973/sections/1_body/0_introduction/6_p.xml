 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and that tolerance limits determine whether the species are able to withstand the conditions imposed by an ever-changing environment, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of climate change on the distribution of native freshwater fish of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) using SDMâ€™s combined with a physiological trait (the upper thermal tolerance limit). Firstly, we modelled the effects of future climate (2050 and 2080) on fish species richness, also investigating the responses of individual species in terms of whether they were predicted to undergo range expansion or contraction. Next, we analyzed the effects of climate change on functional diversity (functional richness, functional dispersion and functional uniqueness) of fish assemblages, identifying climatically suitable areas for species persistence as well as areas that preserve their existing functional character under future scenarios. Finally, we identified which functional trait characteristics may become dominant in fish assemblages in future, and those that may be lost as a result of climate change. By simultaneously considering taxonomic and functional attributes, and by coupling environment and physiology in estimation of species distribution, our study provides important information for guiding the spatial distribution of conservation efforts required in the Murray-Darling Basin in the light of potential effects of climate change on freshwater fish.
