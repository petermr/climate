<p>Fish are the most diverse group of freshwater vertebrates and play a central role in the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems [

However, the effects of climate change on the functional diversity of freshwater fish remain poorly understood, and the few studies that have used the functional characteristics of species to infer their sensitivity to climate change are mostly restricted to the northern hemisphere (see [
