<p>One way to anticipate the impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity within a functional context is to use correlative predictive models, usually referred to as species distribution models (SDMs) (or ecological niche models; see [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], followed by comparative analysis of the current and future functional structure of the assemblages. Although SDMs are useful for this goal, they typically disregard the influence of physiological traits of the species which can mediate spatial and temporal variation in their distributions in response to environmental change [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For example, thermal tolerance limits, especially the upper thermal limit, are essential to define species distribution changes in response to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. Incorporating such physiological information can provide a more mechanistic basis for predicting ecological responses to climate change [
