<p>Our study predicts a severe negative impact of future climate change over both taxonomic (species richness) and functional components of the ichthyofauna of the Murray-Darling Basin. Although this study focused on 23 of the 46 native species occurring in the basin, the general pattern of response to climate change we find is likely to be same for the other species of fish. Species distribution modelling combined with a physiological parameter and followed by a functional analysis, suggest a loss of climatically suitable areas, leading to less cells with the highest values of species richness, the contraction of range and loss of function of the majority of freshwater fishes of the MDB. These findings imply that under climate change, local extinction rates can increase considerably throughout the basin. Impacts are predicted to be particularly high along the north and northeaster regions, where high rates of loss of climatically suitable areas are projected by the end of the century. The upper catchments of the southern Basin, especially the upper Murray, Mitta Mitta, Goulburn and Campaspe Rivers stand out as potential climate refuges in the future scenarios, showing the highest values of retained species richness and functional diversity.</p>
