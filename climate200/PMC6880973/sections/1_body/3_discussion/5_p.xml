<p>Range contraction of fish assemblages was predicted in all future climate scenarios. Declines in species distribution occur because species have particular environmental requirements and physiological characteristics, directly influencing their adaptive responses to the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. For freshwater fish, these attributes are usually habitat conditions, especially temperature, dissolved oxygen and hydrology [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Habitats become unsuitable when conditions vary beyond tolerable limits of the species. When this occurs, metabolism and individual performance of organisms (especially ectotherms) are affected, decreasing the intrinsic rate of population growth and leading to extinction scenarios over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Under our simulations, the most alarming scenario is that five fish species are predicted to lose 100% of environmental suitable habitat within the MBD by the end of century. Two of these; 
 <italic>Galaxias oliros</italic> (obscure galaxias) and 
 <italic>Maccullochella macquariensis</italic> (trout cod), represent global extinctions given that both species are endemic to the MDB [
 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly critical is the status of 
 <italic>Bidyanus bidyanus</italic> (silver perch) which is considered as vulnerable species by International Union for Conservation of Nature (VU-IUCN), and listed as critically endangered under federal legislation in Australia.
