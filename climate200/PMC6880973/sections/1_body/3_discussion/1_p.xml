 <xref rid="pone.0225128.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]), SDMs present limitations, especially those related to predictive uncertainties as aforementioned. In addition, the correlative approach of SDMs is exclusively focused on environmental-species occurrence correlations, ignoring physiological characteristics of species, which are traditionally addressed by mechanistic modeling (see [
