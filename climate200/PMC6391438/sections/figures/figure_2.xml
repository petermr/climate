 <caption>
  <p>Upper quartile of fire size distributions by time period. The periods are 2010–39 (early), 2040–69 (mid), and 2070–99 (late). An asterisk denotes that the static distribution is significantly greater (*p &lt; 0.001) than the dynamic distribution for that time period. The dynamic simulations include decadal re-estimated area burned distributions that account for prior fire events and projected climate. The static simulations include area burned distributions estimated only on projected climate. Fire sizes are from 10 replicate simulations for each of the three climate scenarios. Boxes represent the median and quartiles, whiskers the non-outlier range, and dots the outliers.</p>
