<p id="Par16">We simulated forest dynamics under projected climate and wildfire using the LANDIS-II forest succession and disturbance model, with the Century Succession extension
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> (v3.1.1) to simulate carbon pools and fluxes and the Dynamic Leaf Biomass Fuel extension

 </sup> (v2.0) and Dynamic Fire extension
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> (v.2.0.5) to simulate wildfire and fuels. The model was previously parameterized and validated for our study area
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>

 <sub>2</sub>, empirical evidence indicates that CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects are less likely as a result of N limitation
