<p id="Par20">Fire size distributions by time period aggregated all simulated fires for the three transects. We used Welch two sample t-test on log-transformed fire sizes to compare the static and dynamic fire size distributions. To scale simulation results from our transects to the entire Sierra Nevada, we calculated area-weighted estimates by applying area-weighted mean values by vegetation type from the three transects to the entire mountain range (3.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ha). All simulation data were processed and analyzed using R

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
