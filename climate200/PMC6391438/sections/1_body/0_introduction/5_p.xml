 </sup>. To improve the linkage between prior and future fire events as moderated by vegetation and quantify the influence of this feedback on carbon dynamics and wildfire emissions in the Sierra Nevada, we used a process-based forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to simulate forest and fire dynamics for three transects across the Sierra Nevada Mountains under projected climate (see Methods, Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We conducted simulations that assumed climate only affected area burned distributions via fuel flammability (static) and area burned distributions that accounted for the interaction of climate and prior fire events on both fuel flammability and availability (dynamic) using climate projections from three climate models forced with the medium-high, A2 emission scenario. The dynamic simulations used biomass layers that were impacted by fires simulated in the prior decade to re-estimate fire size distributions for the subsequent decade. Prior fire events impacted both the distribution of biomass and the fuel model that contributes to the determination of fire spread characteristics.
