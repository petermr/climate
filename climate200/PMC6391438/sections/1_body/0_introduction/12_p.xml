<p id="Par13">In addition to the emissions challenges on-going climate change poses to California, increasing area burned, especially if the fraction of high-severity fire increases, presents additional challenges for meeting the Stateâ€™s climate mitigation target. However, this is not a foregone conclusion. Prior research has shown that managing the low- and mid-elevation forests in the Sierra Nevada with frequent burning can significantly reduce the area burned by high-severity wildfire and wildfire emissions

 </sup>. The rate at which these treatments are applied can significantly alter the amount of C emitted to the atmosphere as area burned by wildfire increases through this century. Given we found no difference in area burned through 2039 for our two scenarios and the potential for regular burning to alter the way wildfire interacts with forests, early action to reduce the chance of high-severity fire could yield significant gains in reducing emissions.
