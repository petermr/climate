<p id="Par7">Accounting for the bottom-up control on area burned exerted by the effect of prior wildfire on vegetation available to burn, we found reductions in cumulative area burned ranging from −9.8 to −21.8% across the three transects (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Scaled to the mountain range, this equates to a reduction in area-weighted mean cumulative area burned of 2563.7 km
 <sup>2</sup> through 2100, a −14.3% change in cumulative area burned when accounting for the effects of prior wildfires on fire size.
