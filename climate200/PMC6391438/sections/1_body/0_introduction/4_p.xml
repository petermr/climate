<p id="Par5">The forests of the Sierra Nevada of California were historically shaped by fire, with low- and mid-elevation forests having fire return intervals on the order of years to decades and high-elevation forests on the order of decades to centuries

 </sup>. When a forest burns at higher frequency, fires tend to be less severe and the resultant emissions are lower

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Further, fire-induced tree mortality is lower and the amount of carbon taken up and stored by ecosystems for a sustained period is higher
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. However, many of the fire-prone forests in the Sierra are in a higher biomass state as a result of fire-exclusion, and this has increased the proportion of the landscape that is impacted by more severe fire
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. When a forested area experiences high-severity fire, it has an increased probability of a subsequent fire being high-severity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>; which has implications for both future carbon uptake and emissions if the post-fire community that develops has a lower biomass density
