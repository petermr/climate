<p id="Par8">The cumulative area burned results were driven by the effect of prior burns on limiting the size of individual fire events because we held all other parameters constant between the two scenarios. The north transect showed a larger decrease in area burned under the dynamic scenario than the central and south transects because the north transect is less topographically diverse and a larger fraction of the land area is in lower elevation vegetation types that are available to burn over a larger proportion of the year. There was no statistical difference between fire size distributions during the first three decades of the simulation period, with means of 1060 ha for dynamic and 1105 ha for static simulations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). However, by the final three decades of the simulation period (2070–2099), accounting for the influence of prior fires on subsequent fire size yielded a 20.9% reduction in mean fire size for the dynamic simulations (Supplementary Table
