<p>Both the renewable-energy results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g005">Fig 5</xref> and the climate-change results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g006">Fig 6</xref> exhibit minor survey-to-survey fluctuations, within sampling error bars. Overall, however, they show substantial consistency around upward trends. Northeast Oregon acceptance of ACC remains well below national or northeastern levels, but drifts similarly upward over this period. Multivariate analysis will later establish that the trends of both Oregon and New Hampshire series in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g006">6</xref> are statistically significant.
