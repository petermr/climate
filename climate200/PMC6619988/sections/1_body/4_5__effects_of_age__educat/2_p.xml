<p>Odds ratios significantly above 1.0 for 
 <italic>year</italic>, across all four models in 
 <xref rid="pone.0217608.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, confirm the upward drift of support for renewable energy and acceptance of ACC in both New Hampshire and Oregon data (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We also see odds ratios below 1.0 for 
 <italic>age</italic> across all four models (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). That is, older respondents in both New Hampshire and Oregon are less inclined to prioritize renewable energy, and also less inclined to believe that humans are changing the climate. (Note that 
 <italic>age</italic> is entered as a measurement variable—simply, age in years—for the models of 
 <xref rid="pone.0217608.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, although we grouped age for readability in the graphs.) The 
 <italic>year</italic> and 
 <italic>age</italic> effects agree with simpler results visualized in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g008">8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217608.g009">9</xref>: clear ordering and wide separation of response preferences by 
 <italic>age regardless of trend</italic>, but also 
 <italic>upward trends regardless of age</italic>.
