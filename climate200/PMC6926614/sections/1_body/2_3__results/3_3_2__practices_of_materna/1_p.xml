<p>According to the community people, pregnant women suffer a lot during floods. They often have no prior planning for the management of maternal complications during floods. Pregnant women do not receive special attention in terms of care or treatment. Local public healthcare facilities and healthcare providers were not available for maternal care. The husband of a mother with severe labor pain commonly accompanied her during boat transportation. But if any complication arises, they communicate with the village doctors (rural medical practitioners without any formal medical degree), local kabiraj (a type of quack practicing traditional Ayurveda), and a traditional birth attendant for help. If any serious maternal complications arise, they arrange an emergency boat, trawler, or any available mode of transport to transfer the mother to the nearby hospital as per suggestion by the village doctor and traditional birth attendant. (N.B. Traditional Ayurveda is not a scientifically approved medicine. But people have practiced it for hundreds of years. It is locally made by traditional, untrained people. Kabiraj and village doctors are not government employed, rather they practice at rural areas without any professional skills).</p>
