<p id="Par48">Perceived 
 <bold>context factors</bold> are summarized as personal, farm, and regional characteristics. The 
 <bold>integrative adaptors</bold> are characterized by their deep appreciation of nature, their high environmental awareness, and their desire for independence. This results in a high environmental or sustainability performance of 
 <bold>their farms</bold>. The farms are organically certified except in one case. This farmer follows the guidelines for organic production but does not want to forgo the use of chemical pesticides in extreme years. Environmental-friendly production is perceived to decrease the farmâ€™s vulnerability to regional climate change but to increase its susceptibility to pest pressure. Full-time farming is predominant in this group but part-time farming also occurs. With respect to 
 <bold>regional characteristics</bold>, integrative adaptors refer to land cover, land use, and landscape patterns because of their effect on soil water erosion and nutrient emissions.
