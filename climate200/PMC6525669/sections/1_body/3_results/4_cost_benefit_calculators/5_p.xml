<p id="Par56">When climate change adaptation is explicitly addressed, the cost-benefit calculators form 
 <bold>adaptation intention</bold> with a long-term planning horizon. The farmers argue that they generally base their farm management decisions on cost-benefit analyses. Therefore, they balance perceived risks related to climate change against adaptation costs, which delays actual implementation of more elaborate adaptation measures that change the farmsâ€™ characteristics or strategic orientation.
