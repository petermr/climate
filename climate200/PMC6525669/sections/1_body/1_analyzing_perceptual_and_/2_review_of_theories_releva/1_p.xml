<p id="Par11">Behavioural theories explain adaptation intentions through various perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. Of particular relevance to agricultural adaptation are (i) the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1985</xref>) that draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1975</xref>), (ii) the Values Beliefs Norms Theory (VBN; Stern 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2000</xref>), (iii) the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1983</xref>; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1997</xref>), and (iv) the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC; Grothmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>; Grothmann and Patt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>), which has its roots in PMT.
