<p>The LAI, which is equally significant to the LA, is expected to increase with precipitation and temperature due to energy-balance constraints (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2017</xref>). According to these constraints, leaf temperature is usually lower than air temperature under warm, well-watered, mid-day conditions (

 <sub>air</sub> between 25 and 30Â°C); otherwise, leaf temperature is higher than air temperature. At night, leaf temperature is usually lower than air temperature. By specifying the lower and upper thermal limits for leaf damage, we can predict the maximum LA in any climate. LA is an important target for modeling because (a) it contributes to the determination of the temperature at which photosynthesis, respiration and evaporation from the leaf surface take place, and (b) it climatically determines shifts in leaf size that should be linked to major changes in community composition. Three traits are co-located and present trait covariations effectively, which is important information for balancing traits in vegetation modeling.
