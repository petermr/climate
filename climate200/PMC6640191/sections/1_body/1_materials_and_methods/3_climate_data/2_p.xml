<p>Three earth system models, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MPI-ESM-MR, and NorESM1-M (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were selected, and the climatic data were downloaded from the CMIP5 website
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn01">1</xref>
 </sup>. These data included the mean annual temperature (MAT, °C), mean annual precipitation (MAP, mm/day) and monthly photosynthetically active radiation (mPAR, W ⋅ m
 <sup>-2</sup> ⋅ day
 <sup>-1</sup>). mPAR was calculated by SPLASH v1.0 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2017</xref>) with surface down-welling shortwave radiation (rsds) data. All the climatic data were interpolated into 0.085° × 0.085° with the tools in ANUSPLIN4.4 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson and Xu, 2013</xref>). To adjust the bias of future climate models, anomalies were calculated as the differences between the model’s data from 2006 to 2014 and historical data from 2006 to 2014. A time series of future climate was produced by subtracting the anomalies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This strategy preserved the continuity and stability between the future model’s data and the historical data (
