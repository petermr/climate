<p>Leaf area (LA) is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment (

We used continuous records for LAI from 8-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (MOD15A2, 549 periods) to replace the LA; these data were averaged, and the effect of cloud-contaminated or aerosol-contaminated reflectance was removed using the methods proposed by
