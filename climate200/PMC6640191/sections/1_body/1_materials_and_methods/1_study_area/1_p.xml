 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">López-Pujol et al., 2006</xref>). Annual average temperatures range from -21.0°C to 26.0°C and increase from north to south. Annual precipitation ranges from 0 to 2250 mm and decreases from southeast to northwest. A steep climate gradient and abundant plant species make China an ideal region to analyze the response of vegetation to changing climates.
