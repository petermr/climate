<p>Redundancy analysis (RDA) is a method of extracting the variation in a set of response variables that can be explained by a set of explanatory variables (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Borcard et al., 1992</xref>). Through calculating eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the combination of response variables and explanatory variables, information concerning a number of constrained axes (RDA axes) and unconstrained axes (principal component axes) can be obtained. The constrained axes represent the part of the response variables (trait here) explained by the explanatory variables (climate here), which can be used to predict trait variations under future climate scenarios. Traits were only measured in the dominant species. The SLA and
