<p>Gaussian functions and their combinations are widely applied in bio-statistics to describe complex distributions and classifications (for algorithm details, see 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Witte et al., 2007</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Once Gaussian density distributions are ascertained in the discriminant classification, we can easily obtain the classification probability associated with each class. A GMM is a combination of several Gaussian components that do not require any arbitrary and potentially restrictive assumptions in the form of probability density functions, and it is an effective vegetation classifier in trait-based modeling (
