<p>Considerable progress has been achieved toward improving the framework of current DGVMs or modeling vegetation distributions based on trait–climate relationships. To overcome the limitations that arise due to fixed or constant traits in PFTs, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Verheijen et al. (2013)</xref> allowed three key functional traits to vary within PFTs via trait–climate relationships, which enabled more variation in vegetation responses to be included in DGVMs. 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pavlick et al. (2013)</xref> simulated the performances of a large number of random plant growth strategies, each depicted by a set of 15 traits that represent various ecosystem functions including carbon allocation, ecophysiology, phenology and vegetation dynamics. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Scheiter et al. (2013)</xref> presented a trait- and individual-based vegetation model that permitted individual plants to adopt a combination of trait values. Another individual- and trait- based DGVM, the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed model with flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT), incorporates five traits to describe the performance of trees and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at a regional scale (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sakschewski et al., 2015</xref>). Although these approaches have been criticized because some traits are not measurable or because of weak trait–environment relationships, they have provided different perspectives on the construction of new trait-based DGVMs.
