<p>Except for 
 <italic>S. tomentosa</italic>, slope grade significantly affected the distribution of seven dominant species (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00370-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Among the eight species, 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> had the largest abundance across all slope grades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00370-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and were mainly distributed on slopes below 35°. The distribution of 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> concentrated on slopes below 5°. However, the majority of the herbs concentrated on steep slopes (above 35°) (
