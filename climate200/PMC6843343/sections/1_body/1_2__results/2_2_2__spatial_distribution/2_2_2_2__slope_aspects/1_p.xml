<p>Slope aspects significantly affected the abundance of the two shrubs (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The abundance 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> were large on the north-facing and south-facing slope. The abundance of 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> were low on all slope aspects, especially, rarely seen on the southeast-facing slope, southwest-facing and east-facing slopes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00370-f002">Figure 2</xref>). No significant difference in the abundance of 
 <italic>R. chrysanthum</italic> was observed between those on the north-facing and south-facing slope (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but there were significant differences in those on west-facing, southwest-facing, southeast-facing, and east-facing slopes (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). The abundance of 
 <italic>V. uliginosum</italic> on the north-facing slope differed significantly with those on other slopes (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) (
