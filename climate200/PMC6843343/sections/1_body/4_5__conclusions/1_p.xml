<p>The Changbai alpine shrub tundra vegetation is changing. Our results indicated that the dominance of dwarf shrubs declined, while the herbaceous species have encroached and expanded on the alpine tundra zone and have become co-dominant plant species. Herbs typically invaded and occurred on semi-sunny slopes, steep slopes, and depression. Micro-topography and slope grade had much stronger effects on herb plant distribution than elevation in the shrub tundra. Our results suggest that various micro-topographic factors associated with variations in climatic and edaphic conditions determine the spatial distribution of plants in the alpine tundra zone. Future climate warming may cause decreased snow thickness, and increased growing season length and drought stress, which may further promote replacement of the shrubs by herbs. This change could be seen as a negative effect on the Changbai alpine tundra zone in the future. Further studies need to focus on the physio-ecological mechanisms underlying the vegetation change in the alpine tundra area under global climate change.</p>
