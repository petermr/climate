<p>The main factors affecting the composition of alpine plant communities are altitude, topography, and those-associated soil development [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Altitude is the main variable affecting floristic diversity in the communities as a whole, but an individual species existing in a community is more influenced by topography [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. From wind-exposed ridges to small micro-sites, the effects of topography were found to create various ecological conditions with different temperature, snow accumulation, and water availability, as well as soil development and soil nutrient supply [
