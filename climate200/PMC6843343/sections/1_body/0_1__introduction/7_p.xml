<p>To understand the factors affecting distribution and immigration of plants, and, thus, to predict the future vegetation composition of the Changbai Mountain tundra, we examined the characteristics and differences in the spatial distribution of dominant plants in that tundra. We used the descriptive statistics of all dominant species to study the variation characteristics of dominant species in the community and the change process of the tundra community. We performed one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and generalized linear models (GLMs) to test the differences in the spatial distribution of the dominant species in elevation, slope aspect, slope grade, and micro-topography. We conducted redundancy analysis (RDA) of the dominant species and environmental factors to find the main factors determining the spatial distribution of the dominant species. After that, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying changes in the tundra vegetation of the Changbai Mountains. We aimed to test the hypothesis that topography rather than other environmental factors determine the herbaceous vegetation expansion in the tundra of the Changbai Mountains. Our results of vegetation changes, process, and mechanisms of the Changbai alpine tundra can provide a better understanding of how the tundra vegetation will respond to global climate change.</p>
