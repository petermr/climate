<p>Alpine tundra ecosystems are controlled by a low temperature. The lower temperature with increasing altitude accounts for more than 80% of the variation among summits to explain the community species composition [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Current global warming directly affect temperature in the tundra zone, and indirectly change the precipitation and snow cover, which leads to changes in species’ composition. Species with similar distributions respond similarly to large and local ecological gradients [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Biogeographic deconstruction has been used to assess community patterns of species indifferent habitats and their ecological requirements [

 <xref rid="B52-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Compared with previous analysis at the community level in the Changbai alpine tundra, our analysis at the species level provided a better understanding of the influence of altitude and micro-topography on the changes in the distribution of shrub and herbaceous plants, and shift of the tundra species’ composition under climate change. For example, six herbaceous species have already occupied lower elevations, a semi-sunny slope aspect, steep slope, and depression in that tundra, which shifted the shrub tundra to the shrub-herb tundra. Our results showed that the Shannon-Wiener index was mainly affected by the altitude, whereas the shrub/herb ratio and six herbaceous dominant species were significantly affected by micro-topography, slope grade, and slope aspects. These findings are consistent with earlier studies [
