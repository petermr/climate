<p>Statistical characteristics of the six herb species suggested that their invasion was not synchronous. 
 <italic>S. parviflora</italic> invaded the tundra earlier and, thus, it has time to establish with a stable distribution, which indicates a late invasion stage, and it has become a primary dominant species among the six herb species. Compared to 
 <italic>S. parviflora</italic>, the distribution of 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> reflected a mid-stage of invasion, and 
 <italic>S. tomentosa</italic> and 
 <italic>G. baishanense</italic> were at an early invasion stage, which are starting to invade the tundra.
