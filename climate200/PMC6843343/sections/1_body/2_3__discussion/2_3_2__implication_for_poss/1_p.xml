<p>Our results indicated that herbaceous species gradually migrated from lower elevations to tundra at high elevations. In the cold conditions of the tundra of the Changbai Mountains, shrubs have a competitive advantage over herbs [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These factors allow historically low elevation species (herbs) to survive at higher elevations. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies where air warming resulted in herbaceous plant invasion into alpine and arctic tundras [
