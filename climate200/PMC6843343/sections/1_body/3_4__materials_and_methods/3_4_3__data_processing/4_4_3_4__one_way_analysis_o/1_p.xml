<p>One-way ANOVA was used to test the effects of environmental factors on the abundance of the eight dominant plant species. First, environmental factors were divided into different groups in Excel 2016 (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Then SPSS 22.0 was used to analyze the difference in abundance of plant species within each standardized environmental factor (
 <xref rid="plants-08-00370-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the degree of influence of different environmental factors on the distribution of different plant species by SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
