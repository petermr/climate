<p>The importance value index (IV) describes which species are the most important within the studied area, and was also determined according to the Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg formulas (1974) [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Importance value = [relative density + relative frequency + relative coverage]/3, where the relative density = number of individuals of a plant/total number of plants × 100. The relative frequency = frequency of a plant population/sum of all population frequencies × 100. The relative coverage = coverage of a plant population/sum of all population coverage × 100.
