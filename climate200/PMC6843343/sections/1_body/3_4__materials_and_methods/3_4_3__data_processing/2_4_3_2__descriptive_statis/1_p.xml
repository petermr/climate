<p>With descriptive statistics [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], we analyzed the abundance value for the eight dominant species in each of the 132 plots, and obtained the dominant species plant distribution characteristics, including the mean value, the coefficient of variation, the skewness, and the kurtosis. Mean value describes the central tendency. The coefficient of variation describes the discrete degree. Skewness and kurtosis describe the distribution shape. The distribution and variation characteristics are indicated by the coefficient of variation (CV), skewness (SK), and kurtosis (KU). The coefficient of variation of species reflects the degree of relative variation at plot level [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It is generally considered that CV &lt; 0.1 is weak variability, 0.1 ≤ CV ≤ 1.0 is moderate variability, and CV &gt; 1.0 is strong variability [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. We can infer the change stage or succession stage of the community by the skewness coefficient and kurtosis coefficient. The skewness of a standard normal distribution is 0. If one or more observations are extremely large, the mean of the distribution becomes larger than the median and the distribution is called positively skewed (SK &gt; 0) [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. If one or more observations are extremely small, the mean of the distribution becomes smaller than the median and the distribution is called negatively skewed (SK &lt; 0) [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The kurtosis of a standard normal distribution is 3 [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is called a leptokurtic distribution (“lepto” means slender) if KU &gt; 3 [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is called a mesokurtic distribution (“meso” means intermediate) if KU = 3 [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. It is called a platykurtic distribution (“platy” means flat) if KU &lt; 3 [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00370" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The greater the absolute value of kurtosis is, or the more extreme values of the data series are, the more deviated from the normal distribution, or the higher the probability of large fluctuations of the future this species is. When the skewness and the kurtosis of a species is close to 0 and 3, respectively, the species distribution is close to a normal distribution, which indicates a stable stage of the population or a later stage of community succession. While large skewness and kurtosis indicate an unstable phase of population (undergoing a major change) or an early period of community succession [
