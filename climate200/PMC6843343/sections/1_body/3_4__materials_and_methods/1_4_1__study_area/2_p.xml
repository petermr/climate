<p>The tundra of the Changbai Mountains is located on the upper parts of volcanic cones at elevations of more than 2000 m a.s.l. Tundra plants are well developed at elevations between 2000 and 2300 m a.s.l., where the earthâ€™s surface consists mostly of alkaline trachyte weathered material and a small amount of ash, and has transformed by water to volcanic cone slopes.
