<p>In grapevine, QTL analysis is much more developed than in citrus or olive. GWAS analyses have also been already performed for quality traits (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">Laucou et al., 2018</xref>) and early ripening (
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Studies concerning all aspects of its cultivation including disease resistance (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Blasi et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">Rex et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">Pap et al., 2016</xref>), quality traits in berries (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Cabezas et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2016</xref>); growth and reproductive traits (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">Houel et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), yield and agronomic traits such as adaptation to water deficit and lime induced iron chlorosis (
 <xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">Viana et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Coupel-Ledru et al., 2014</xref>) and, particularly, the adaptation of grapevine varieties to a climate change scenario (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Duchene et al., 2012</xref>), have been carried out. To this respect, GWAS studies along with the analysis of population structures have shown that LD in the domesticated grapevine is low, even at short ranges, but persists above background levels, set around 3 kb (
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">Myles et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">Nicolas et al., 2016</xref>). Such rapid decay of LD was also observed in 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>silvestris</italic> decreasing to 0.1 within 2.7 cM for genotypic data and within 1.4 cM for haplotypic data (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Barnaud et al., 2010</xref>). Considering this rapid LD decay, 
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">Myles et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that for grapevine “[…] whole-genome sequencing will become the genotyping method of choice for genome-wide genetic mapping studies.”
