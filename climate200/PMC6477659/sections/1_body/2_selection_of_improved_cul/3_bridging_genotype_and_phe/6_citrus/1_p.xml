<p>Most of the citrus germplasm results from interspecific hybridization and is highly heterozygous (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Curk et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, genetic mapping studies and QTL analysis are mainly based in a two-way pseudo-test cross-mapping strategy, from controlled hybridization between two heterozygous parents, and producing genetic maps for each parent (

 <italic>Citrus</italic> and 
 <italic>Poncirus</italic> species. Due to the high structuration of the citrus gene pool, composite populations built from germplasm accessions and hybrids between several parents are used for GWAS studies and the elaboration of GS models (
