<p>Citrus, with a basic chromosome number of 9, has a relatively small genome size. It varies among ancestral taxa from 398 to 360 Mb/haploid genome for 
 <italic>C. medica</italic> and 
 <italic>C. reticulata</italic>, respectively. 
 <italic>C. maxima</italic> had an intermediate genome size of 383 Mb (
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">Ollitrault et al., 1994</xref>) and the haploid genome of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> was estimated to be 372 Mb. Several types of co-dominant nuclear markers have been developed for genetic studies in citrus; among the most currently used, SSR derived from genomic (

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2015</xref>) are found. With the development of NGS technologies, SNPs derived from genomic or transcriptomic studies have become one of the most important resources for molecular marker development (

 </sup> and developed Affymetrix Axion SNP arrays with about 1.556,000 SNPs. Additionally, GBS and Restriction site-Associated DNA markers sequencing or RADseq analyses have already been successfully developed in citrus (

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Oueslati et al., 2017</xref>). The first reference genetic map based on co-dominant markers (SSRs, Indels and SNPs) with known flanking sequences was established for 
 <italic>C. clementina</italic> (
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">Ollitrault et al., 2012</xref>) and, subsequently, saturated maps of sweet orange (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), mandarin (
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et al., 2014</xref>) and pummelo (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) where published. Important success has been accomplished in the field of structural genomics in the last 10 years: reference genomes assembled in pseudomolecules were released for sweet orange (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), clementine (
 <xref rid="B272" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) and pummelo (
 <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">Wang X. et al., 2017</xref>). Most of the 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> species were re-sequenced revealing the interspecific admixture of modern varieties (

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Asins et al., 2015</xref>)]. Recently, GWAS studies were performed for quality traits (

However, the learning and applications populations were limited to one parental combination. Working with composite populations associating traditional germplasms and recent hybrids, 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Minamikawa et al. (2017)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Imai et al. (2018)</xref> developed GS models for quality traits based on wider learning diversity.
