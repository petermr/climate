<p>QTL studies, GWAS, and GS advances can be hampered by the current knowledge on genomics and genetic marker resources development. The application of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to reduced genome representation, with methods such as restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq; 
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2007</xref>) or genotyping by sequencing (GBS; 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Elshire et al., 2011</xref>) is particularly promising. These methods allow deep coverage of the regions adjacent to restriction sites and offer great potential for high-throughput genotyping of entire genomes and for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) mining at the same time. They are therefore very well suited for the analysis of large segregating progenies and marker trait association studies based on LD (

Compared with microarray analyses, these methods present the advantages of flexibility and the lack of requirement to refer to a set of pre-determined polymorphisms. High-throughput genotyping at affordable costs opens the way to GS that is much more efficient than marker-assisted selection (MAS) to increase genetic gain of complex traits per unit time and cost (
