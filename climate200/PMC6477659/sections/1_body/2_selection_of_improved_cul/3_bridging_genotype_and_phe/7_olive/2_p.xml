 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> is considered a diploid species with 
 <italic>n</italic> = 23 chromosomes. However, cytogenetic studies (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Breviglieri and Battaglia, 1954</xref>) proposed that the species had originated from interspecific crosses, probably by parentals whose haploid chromosome numbers were 
 <italic>n</italic> = 11 and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 12 as occurs with several species of the Oleaceae family. The nuclear DNA content of 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic> cultivars estimated by flow cytometry ranged between 1.45 and 1.53 Gb/haploid genome and the genome size of wild olive was estimated 1.59 Gb/haploid genome (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">Loureiro et al., 2007</xref>). Many molecular studies in olive, including the most recent, are based on dominant markers such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), or Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) despite much more useful co-dominant markers have been developed during the recent years (see 
 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr">Sebastiani and Busconi, 2017</xref> for review). First olive SSR markers were published by 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Cipriani et al. (2002)</xref> and more recently numerous SSRs have been developed from EST data (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">De la Rosa et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Essalouh et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">Mariotti et al., 2016</xref>). SNP mining and marker implementation is ongoing (
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">Reale et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">Kaya et al., 2013</xref>) and Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPS) markers have been successfully developed (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Bazakos et al., 2012</xref>). Until now, there is no SNP microarray for high-throughput genotyping but GBS has been successfully developed rendering saturated maps with more than 4,000 SNP markers constituting 23 linkage groups (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">İpek et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic maps were published by 
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">Khadari et al. (2010)</xref> comprising mainly dominant/anonymous markers. 
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">Sadok et al. (2013)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Essalouh et al. (2014)</xref> added new markers and particularly SSRs in the map of Olivière × Arbequina olive cultivars (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">Khadari et al., 2010</xref>) producing the most saturated olive map generated with traditional molecular markers. Several whole genome sequencing projects engaged during the last years: one by an Italian consortium within the framework of the OLEA project (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Muleo et al., 2012</xref>), the International Olive Genome Sequencing Consortium (IOGC) (
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">Unver et al., 2017</xref>) and another IOGC project that sequenced a 1,000-years old tree of the Spanish ‘Farga’ variety (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Cruz et al., 2016</xref>). Assembly provided a draft genome of 1.31 Gb, representing 95% of the estimated genome length. Nevertheless, few QTL analyses have been published so far: 
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">Sadok et al. (2013)</xref> identified 12 QTLs associated to flowering, fruiting and production whereas (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Atienza et al., 2014</xref>) performed an association study with olive oil quality criteria. A genetic association study was performed with SSRs markers to develop MAS for fatty acid contents 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">Ipek et al. (2015)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Kaya et al. (2016)</xref> reported the first GWAS study for yield-related traits.
