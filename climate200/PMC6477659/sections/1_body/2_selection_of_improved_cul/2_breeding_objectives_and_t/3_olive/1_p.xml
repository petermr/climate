<p>Due to the high success of the selected varieties in the local climate and under the traditional extensive rain-fed cultivation techniques, genotypic selection has not been as efficient as in the rest of woody crops reviewed here, and most of the new cultivars recently released are clones of traditional varieties (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">Lavee, 2013</xref>). However, the challenges posed by climate change and, in particular, the new intensive methods of cultivation, urge the introduction of new varieties better adapted to the coming climate conditions. For instance, traditional varieties with low vegetative vigor seem to be better suited for high-density cultivation in hedgerows (
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">Tous et al., 2008</xref>), opening the possibility to use these genotypes for breeding of new varieties and rootstocks adapted to this type of cultivation (
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">Rugini et al., 2016</xref>). Diploid and tetraploid dwarfing rootstocks have been used to reduce total plant height as well as maintaining oil quality, making them interesting candidates for intensive cultivation. Olive tree germplasm resources encompass more than 1,500 cultivars with wide genetic diversity that could be useful for conventional breeding to improve stress tolerance (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni and Belaj, 2010</xref>). The most amenable wild germplasm resource to exploit is 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> (
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">Klepo et al., 2013</xref>) bearing several abiotic stress tolerance traits (
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Romero-Aranda et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">Mulas, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Baldoni et al., 2006</xref>), as well as improved resistance to several pests and diseases (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Ciccarese et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">Mkize et al., 2008</xref>). However, the use of wild germplasm resources for olive tree breeding is still very limited (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Besnard et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Caceres et al., 2015</xref>). At present, the main breeding objectives are to select new cultivars and rootstocks with adaptation to different adverse environmental conditions and to implement modern farming practices in order to meet consumersâ€™ demands for oil production and olives for fresh consumption (
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">Medina et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Diez et al., 2015</xref>). The Gene Pool Method (GPM) was recently applied to olive tree breeding in order to integrate a broader diversity; it is based on information from phylogeny, domestication, and hybridization affinity among cultivated, wild ecotypes, and other 
 <italic>Olea</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">Rugini et al., 2016</xref>).
