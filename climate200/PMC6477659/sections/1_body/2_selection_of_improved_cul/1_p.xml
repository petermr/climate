<p>Plant breeding is an important way to improve crop adaptation to abiotic stresses in the context of global climate change. At the commercial level, all three woody crops are propagated vegetatively. Therefore, any elite genotype can be clonally multiplied irrespective of the complexity of its genomic structure. For a long time, this clonal selection was based on natural bud sprouts identified in the field. Today, many modern breeding projects rely on sexual reproduction to exploit favorable traits identified in germplasm accessions, but these initiatives are hampered by the extended juvenile phase existing in most woody perennial plants (
