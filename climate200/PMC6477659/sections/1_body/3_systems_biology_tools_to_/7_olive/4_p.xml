<p>Most recently available studies using systems biology tools in olive have so far relied mainly on transcriptomic approaches focusing on regulatory processes during developmental events, namely flower development (

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">Iaria et al., 2016</xref>), as well as overall plant architecture (

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Non-targeted approaches could, however, mine important information that could give significant insight into agronomic issues (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ben Ayed et al., 2016</xref>) or stress-related processes. A recent study using a non-targeted metabolomic profiling approach in different olive tree tissues revealed 5,776 metabolite-metabolite correlations and highlighted the upregulation of biosynthetic pathways for phenylpropanoids, monolactams, indole alkaloids and flavonoids especially in young leaves. Considering the well-documented involvement of phenylpropanoids, indole alkaloids and flavonoids in stress protection phenomena, a general defense mechanism was proposed suggesting that metabolites involved in the resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses are mainly biosynthesized in new leaves (
