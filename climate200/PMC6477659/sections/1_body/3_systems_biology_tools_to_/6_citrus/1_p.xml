 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) has played a pivotal role in the development of biotechnological tools in this woody crop. For instance, the generation of a reference RNA-Seq transcriptome revealed the existence of 3,326 new genes and increased the number of alternative splicing variants (
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">Terol et al., 2016</xref>). Annotation of gene function in newly sequenced genomes is not a trivial aspect most efforts are oriented toward the functional annotation of all encoding sequences in the citrus genome. Nowadays, with increasing volumes of transcriptomics data available for 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> species, GCN has become a viable option for predicting gene function at a genome-wide scale targeting genes encoding proteins and/or other non-protein coding RNAs. Compared with classical GO surveys, GCN poses the advantage of allowing the annotation of new genes for which no plausible ortholog in better annotated plant species exists (
