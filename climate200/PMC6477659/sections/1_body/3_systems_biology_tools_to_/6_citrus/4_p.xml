<p>Focusing on abiotic stress, a recent work studied a co-expression network including both mRNA and non-coding miRNAs and a method to identify miRNA-transcription regulator-target connections in citrus was described (

 <italic>Poncirus</italic> with its only representative 
 <italic>P. trifoliata</italic> L. Raf constitutes an example of cold-temperature acclimation in citrus. Hence, the study of cold acclimation in this genotype revealed the involvement of 107 conserved miRNAs and 5 potential novel miRNAs targeting stress-responsive genes (

 <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2017</xref>). A total of 76 miRNA (47 conserved and 29 novel) were altered either by salt stress, desiccation or both. The correlation network was partially consistent regarding differential regulation of miRNA and their respective targets, although the existence of another layer of interaction involving some of the miRNA-regulated genes acting as transcriptional inducers/repressors was also proposed.
