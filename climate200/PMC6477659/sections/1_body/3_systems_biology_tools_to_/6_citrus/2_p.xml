<p>In the pre-genomic era, matching available and annotated ESTs from the Citrus Genome Sequencing Consortium (CitEST) database (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Forment et al., 2005</xref>) was the only way to attain this kind of studies (
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">Quecini et al., 2007</xref>). Using this approach, crucial stress responses in salt-tolerant (Cleopatra mandarin) and –sensitive (Carrizo citrange) citrus rootstocks have been studied (
