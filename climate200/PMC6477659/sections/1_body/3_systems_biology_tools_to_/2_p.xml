<p>Systems biology approaches study biological systems from a multidisciplinary point of view aided by mathematical modeling. To this respect, interaction network analysis constitutes a data-driven approach that represents a biological component (e.g., a gene or a protein) as a node and its physical, genetic and/or functional interactions as edges that help to visualize and interpret multivariate datasets. These representations allow identification of functional modules, transcriptional circuits or signaling pathways contributing to characterize a biological system (

This approach can be applied not only to investigate the participation of different signaling or metabolic pathways in the response to stress but also to infer novel interactions among different network nodes and to predict unknown gene functions (
