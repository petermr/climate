<p>Recently, 
 <xref rid="B269" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Matus (2017)</xref> generated a composite network in grapevine by overlaying co-expression maps between structural and TF genes, integrated with the presence of promoter 
 <italic>cis</italic>-binding elements, miRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) focusing on the phenylpropanoid pathway. This allowed the characterization of novel TFs and miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Following a similar procedure, but integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data of grapevine berries in different developmental stages, 
 <xref rid="B281" ref-type="bibr">Zamboni et al. (2010)</xref> identified biomarkers of berry development and senescence.
