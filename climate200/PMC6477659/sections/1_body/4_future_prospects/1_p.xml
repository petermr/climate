<p>The constraints to global food production posed by climate change conditions have become a key issue in agronomy and plant physiology. Perennial plant species, such as the ones in which this review focuses, are subjected to adverse environmental conditions throughout their entire life cycle, and over consecutive cropping seasons. Therefore, breeding of new varieties more resilient to abiotic stresses with improved performance and productivity traits constitutes a prioritary objective. Efficient plant breeding requires accurate phenotyping of plant traits reliably associated to stress tolerance, enhanced productivity and/or quality. The development of high-throughput phenotyping platforms complements fruit tree genomics bridging phenotype and genotype, allowing GWAS and network analyses expanding our knowledge on genetic responses linked to the development of particular phenotype traits. In the field of abiotic stress tolerance, as an example, the integration of -omics for the engineering and selection of abiotic stress-tolerant genotypes has been successfully applied to staple and forage crops (

 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the existing technological gap between fruit trees, staple and forage crops and model plants in terms of genomic resources, databases and tools, the situation is changing rapidly and the amount of sequenced genomes and gene association studies increasing. It is therefore desirable that, in the following years, curated databases appear including data from different sources and technological platforms. Abiotic stress tolerance traits are complex from the genetic point of view involving an intricate interaction of regulator and effector genes. Therefore, the systems-level analysis of complex phenotype traits requires a complete evaluation of the relevant physiological parameters to integrate the genetic and molecular differences, constituting the real ‘driving force’ in the selection process. Therefore, the integration of accurate phenotype data along with gene expression, metabolite and protein accumulation in different tissues and germplasm accessions would allow researchers performing
