<p>Final fruit yield and quality in citrus depend on a series of concatenated processes, flowering, fruit set and fruit growth and development that are particularly affected by climate change conditions. Sprouting in citrus is independent of the air temperature so it can happen at any moment of the year if soil temperature is above 12°C. Under typical Mediterranean conditions, there are three sprouting events during the year (spring, summer, and fall). Spring flushes generate flower and fruit-bearing branches after flower bud induction during winter (

Flower bud induction is linked to environmental factors such as drought and cool temperatures (below 20°C), this latter being the primary factor. In citrus, the key phenological events in determining final fruit yield are bud floral transition and initial fruit set, that take place during winter and spring in temperate climates. Most cultivated citrus varieties are parthenocarpic or autoincompatible, therefore requiring pollination to initiate ovary-fruit transition but without fertilization of ovules (

As a result, number of flowers could be drastically reduced, increasing the chances of suffering heat stress and massive flower drop (
