<p>Climate change affects plant and animal phenology, their interaction, demography as well as their distribution in natural habitats. To this respect, the effect of global warming on the plant-pollinator interaction through variations in their phenology and range (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">Morton and Rafferty, 2017</xref>) is of special relevance in agronomy. As mentioned above, pollination is of crucial importance in determining fruit yield in grapevine and olive (

 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">Talon et al., 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, this has been poorly investigated in woody crop species, but in ephemeral spring weeds, a clear de-synchronization has been observed between flowering and the incidence of their natural pollinators, bumble-bees, leading to a phenological mismatch and a reduction in reproductive success (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Kudo and Ida, 2013</xref>). In addition to potential phenological mismatches between crop plants and pollinators, changes in pollinator-flower preferences are likely to occur due to increasing ambient temperature. Several studies have shown that bees prefer to collect warm nectar from flowers at low ambient temperatures, but when air temperature rises above 30°C, they usually switch their preferences to cooler flowers (
 <xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). For all these reasons, it is important not to disregard the effects of climate change on insect pollinators: their population trends and phenology in the equation, besides the direct effects on woody crops.
