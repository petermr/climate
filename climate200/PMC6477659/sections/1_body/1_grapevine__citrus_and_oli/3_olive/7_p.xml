<p>Olive tree actually constitutes an interesting model woody crop species to study physiological responses to drought under Mediterranean climate for several reasons: (1) the domestication of olive tree was carried out under Mediterranean conditions, where it adapted remarkably to cope with soil and air water deficits, combining an effective control of water losses with high tolerance to desiccation (

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">Guerfel et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">Trentacoste et al., 2018</xref>), crop species with long life cycles pose difficulties for breeding. This, along with the high adaptation of the species to the local climate, has probably discouraged breeding for drought tolerance in this species.
