<p>The grapevine (
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) belongs to the family Vitaceae. The 
 <italic>Vitis</italic> genus includes about 60 species distributed in Europe, North America, and Asia under temperate Mediterranean and subtropical climatic conditions. 
 <italic>Vitis</italic> is separated in two subgenera, 
 <italic>Euvitis</italic> and 
 <italic>Muscadinia</italic> characterized by different chromosome number (2
 <italic>n</italic> = 38 and 2
 <italic>n</italic> = 40, respectively). Sexual compatibility is wide within each subgenus but most of the inter-sub-generic hybrids are sterile. Nearly all grape cultivars produced for fruit, juice and wine are classified as 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>vinifera</italic> (or 
 <italic>sativa</italic>) or are hybrids of 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic>. Current knowledge points toward its domestication from the wild relative of the same species: 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>sylvestris</italic> (Gmelin) Hegi (

 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">Mihaljević et al., 2013</xref>). Other 
 <italic>Euvitis</italic> species such as 
 <italic>V. rupestris</italic>, 
 <italic>V. riparia</italic> or 
 <italic>V. berlandieri</italic> exhibit significant resistance to Phylloxera, Oidium, and mildews and are used primarily for rootstock breeding. It is believed that the domestication of grapevine originated in a region located between Black Sea and Iran 6,000–9,000 years ago (
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">Myles et al., 2011</xref>). From this spot, it spread toward Middle East and Central Europe which are nowadays considered secondary domestication centers resulting from gene flow between wild and cultivated gene pools (

 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">Myles et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Bouby et al., 2013</xref>). In the Mediterranean Basin, grape spread gradually westwards (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">Terral et al., 2010</xref>), with the most ancient evidence of viticulture found in Greece and Crete (fifth millennium BC), then in Italy (ninth century BC) and Spain (early within the last millennium BC). The French viticulture appears to be more recent (600 years BC).
