  <p>Irrigation management, which aims at improving the efficiency or the volume of water used by the plant in relation with the total amount applied, and also water productivity, the ratio between crop yield and water used, which is normally increased by applying less water than the potential evapotranspiration demand of the crop. However, this reduction needs to be carefully applied to maintain yield (

  <p>Breeding programs for drought-tolerant cultivars. The recent advances in phenotyping and genomics offer the possibility to find new cultivars that can achieve acceptable yields with less water. However, improvement in tolerance to water deficit is particularly elusive due to the complexity of plant responses to drought, in particular concerning with grain and fruit yield. A correct definition of the drought scenario and the crop species physiology under drought is crucial for an efficient selection (
   <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">Tardieu et al., 2011</xref>). Once determined the key processes conferring drought tolerance for a certain species in the target drought scenario, the genes associated to those processes can be identified to assist in breeding. This highlights the role of crop ecophysiology in modern breeding for drought tolerance, which is often neglected (
