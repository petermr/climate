The random effect of plot explained 1% of the variation in plant growth (ICC = 0.010), indicating that a mixed model may not have been more informative than a traditional linear model for predicting plant growth in this case. However, the random effect of plot was retained to account for micro-variation between plots in the model, and to maintain model comparability across species.
