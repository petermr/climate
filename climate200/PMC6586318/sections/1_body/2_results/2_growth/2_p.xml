<p>The highest-ranked model for

 <italic>viscosa</italic> was the base model, with a moderately strong model weight (w

  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 0.52; Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218516.s006">S6 Table</xref>). The second-ranking model contributed substantially to account for most of the remaining weight among those in the model suite (w
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 0.42), which included the negative influence of soil moisture on seedling growth. The random effect of plot explained 8.3% of model variation (ICC = 0.083) in the base model.
