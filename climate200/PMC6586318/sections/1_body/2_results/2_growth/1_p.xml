<p>Plant growth within each species varied dramatically by plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218516.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Predictors of plant growth in linear mixed models varied between species (
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), and for two of the three species, the base model held the most weight (Tables in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218516.s007">S7</xref> Tables). Elevation and soil moisture were not predictive of plant growth in any top models (

 <italic>oahuense</italic> indicated that initial seedling height negatively influenced growth over time, and that as temperature range increased, growth rate increased for seedlings from low elevation origin. The random effect of plot explained approximately 18% of the model variance (ICC = 0.184).
