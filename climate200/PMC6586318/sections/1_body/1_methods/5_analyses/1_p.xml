<p>We compared overall seedling survival across and within each species, by origin (high or low-elevation) using chi-square tests. We used linear mixed models to analyze factors associated with plant growth, and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effect of factors associated with survival. We created separate growth and survival models for each species to maintain comparability across model types, and because multi-species models did not converge. Separate models for each species also allowed model effects such as interactions to be more easily interpreted. We included interactions of origin with climate variables which would indicate that the origin of seed is an important consideration for restoration. An origin by elevation interaction effect, i.e., low origin seedlings do well in low but not high elevations and vice versa, may indicate origin matching elevation, as opposed to greater survival and growth in only low-elevation origin plants.</p>
