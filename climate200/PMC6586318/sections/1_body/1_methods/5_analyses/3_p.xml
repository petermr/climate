<p>Data for growth included an individual slope of growth per day (growth rate index) for each seedling: growth (mm) ~ days since initial height measurement. Data were weighted based on the number of days between measurements. Seedlings with measurements for March–July received a weight of 2.0, those with March–June 1.75, and those with June–July a weight of 1.0.</p>
