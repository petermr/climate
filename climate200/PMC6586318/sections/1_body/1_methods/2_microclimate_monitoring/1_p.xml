<p>Eight HOBO (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts) micro station data loggers (H21-002) were installed at elevation intervals of approximately 60 m within KBC on 16 and 18 December 2014. Each data logger was equipped with two sensors to monitor: 1) temperature and relative humidity (S-TMB-M002), and 2) soil moisture (S-SMC-M005). Temperature and humidity sensors were installed at a height of 1 m above ground at each station, and soil moisture probes at a depth of approximately 10 cm. Data loggers were programmed using HOBOware supporting computer software to store average values at five-minute intervals to allow sufficient battery life and memory storage. Stations were inspected monthly and temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture data were downloaded. Two stations damaged by feral pigs in January 2015 were repaired and all stations were fenced to exclude large animals in Marchâ€’April 2015. Two soil moisture sensors malfunctioned during 1-month periods and were replaced in April and August 2016. We summarized microclimate data by monthly minimum, maximum, and average values for analyses.</p>
