<p>Provenance studies are relatively common in silviculture, and many reciprocal planting studies have investigated how seed origin influences growth and vigor across a speciesâ€™ range [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Local provenancing presumes local plant genotypes to be better adapted to an environment than genotypes from other areas, while admixture provenancing mixes seeds from multiple origins to avoid inbreeding depression. Bucharova et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] introduce regional admixture provenancing, yet another method for sourcing seeds. Aside from model species, provenance trials are not typically conducted within the context of restoration [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and it is generally accepted that seeds for revegetation projects should be sourced as locally as possible. However, biotic conditions are predicted to change across much of the world, particularly across elevation gradients, although shifts will not occur linearly [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, local seed-sourcing, particularly for species with long-generation times, may become an out-dated and potentially ill-suited approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Seed transfer zones, or geographic areas considered safe to move seeds within and not risk maladaptation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], have been generally described in the literature for continental species [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, such maps are not transferable in mountainous tropical regions where habitat heterogeneity exists over short geographic distances due to dramatic elevation, precipitation, and edaphic gradients.
