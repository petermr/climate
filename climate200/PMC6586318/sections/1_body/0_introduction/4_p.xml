<p>Mountain parklands are among the most degraded ecosystems in Hawaiâ€˜i [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Centuries of adverse land use practices and the proliferation of introduced invasive species have caused deforestation, fragmentation, and isolation in native montane plants, disrupting biological connectivity between high-elevation subalpine woodlands and lower-elevation montane wet and mesic forests. Restoration efforts have largely included sourcing seeds from nearby areas when possible, although provenance is not typically tracked with restoration success metrics. Several native plant species in mountain parkland ecosystems are found naturally over a broad range of elevation, but may become range-restricted if environmental conditions shift rapidly as a consequence of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Restoration efforts that include experimentation with multiple provenances may benefit these degraded systems, and link seed origin to outcome.
