<p>The short-term nature of our experiment precluded meaningful findings about enhancing genetic enrichment to build resiliency in restoration strategies; however, limited as is was, it represents one of the few attempts to examine the effects of local climate adaptation within species’ current ranges while conducting restoration experiments in the presence of competition and disturbance from invasive species. Other studies have examined upper-elevation extension of species ranges by observation [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or manipulation [

 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] within native systems, but have not addressed continued persistence within existing species’ ranges, which will be essential for understanding responses of broadly distributed species (but, see review by Godefroid et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Reciprocal and multi-site provenance trials are also often conducted within relatively intact systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in contrast to the degraded mountain parkland in our study [
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218516.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Further studies to robustly test revegetation success in the context of provenance and climate change can provide meaningful insights for land managers navigating restoration needs in rapidly changing climate regimes.
