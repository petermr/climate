<p id="Par17">Past lake-water DOC concentrations were reconstructed by employing a transfer function between VNIR spectra of lake-surface sediments (i.e., the most recently accumulated material) and corresponding measured organic carbon concentrations in the surface water

 </sup>. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model is calibrated against lake-water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations but we interpret these as virtually equivalent to DOC because DOC greatly dominates the TOC pool in lakes used for establishing the model as well as in our study lakes. For example, in our ELA lakes, TOC is on average composed of ~91% DOC, with an average particulate organic carbon content of ~0.7 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. The calibration model is based on 345 Arctic, boreal and northern temperate lakes from Canada, Greenland, Sweden and Finland, covers a TOC range from 0.5 to 41 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>, and has a cross-validated R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.57 and a prediction error of 4.4 mg TOC L

 </sup>. Prior to analyses, sediment samples were freeze-dried and sieved (125 μm mesh) to remove the effects of water and particle size on the VNIR signal. VNIR spectra of samples from the calibration set and the study lakes were recorded with a FOSS NIRSystem 6500 rapid content analyser (Hillerød, Denmark) in diffuse reflectance mode. Each sediment sample spectra represents a mean of 32 scans at 2 nm resolution in the wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm. PLSR modelling and lake-water TOC reconstructions were performed using SIMCA 14.0 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden). The application of the method to annually laminated sediments that have repeatedly been sampled over 27 years demonstrated that sediment-based TOC reconstructions are not biased by post-depositional, diagenetic changes in sediment composition
