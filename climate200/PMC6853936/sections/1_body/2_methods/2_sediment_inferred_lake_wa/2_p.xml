<p id="Par18">The DOC inference model was developed with the explicit intention of reconstructing trends in past lake-water DOC concentrations. Although the model generally overestimates absolute values in the study lakes from Sudbury and the ELA, inferred and observed trends correspond closely (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). For ease of comparison, we standardized inferred long-term DOC trends to illustrate the model’s ability to accurately reconstruct relative DOC changes in the study lakes. Regional relative DOC trends for Sudbury and the ELA were established based on mean DOC concentration changes relative to pre-industrial DOC levels (1780–1850) for the eight lakes from each region. To assure equal weight of each record to the regional trend, temporal DOC changes in each lake were binned (20-year bins for the period 1780–1860 and 10-year bins from 1860 onwards) and missing intervals were interpolated from adjacent intervals by linear regression (Supplementary Fig.
