<p id="Par19">The study lakes are part of monitoring programs led by the International Institute for Sustainable Development for the ELA and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks for Sudbury. Water-chemistry data are presented as annual epilimnetic means for the open-water season (May to October) (Supplementary Figs

Temperature and precipitation data were retrieved from Environment and Climate Change Canada using the second generation of the adjusted and homogenized Canadian climate data, with data for Kenora from 1900 to 2012 and for Sudbury from 1922 to 2012 for precipitation and from 1948 to 2012 for temperature

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> is based on mean annual temperatures relative to the average annual temperature over the period 1820–2017. Smoothed trends are based on 9-year running means for all variables. We used the Mann-Kendall test on annual mean data to determine significant long-term trends (p &lt; 0.05) in climate, deposition and water-chemistry data for our study lakes with at least 25 years of monitoring data (ELA: n = 3; Sudbury/Killarney: n = 4). The Theil-Sen slope estimator was used to quantify annual temporal changes, and relative changes in DOC concentrations are based on Theil-Sen slopes relative to mean DOC levels for the monitoring period. All statistical tests were performed in the R environment
