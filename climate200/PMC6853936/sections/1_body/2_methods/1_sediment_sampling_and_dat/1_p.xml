<p id="Par16">Sediment cores were recovered from the deepest basin of each lake in 2006 and 2012 for Sudbury/Killarney lakes and in 2003 and 2006 for ELA lakes using a gravity corer (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). All sediment cores were radiometrically dated by analysing 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb, 
 <sup>226</sup>Ra (via its granddaughter isotope 
 <sup>214</sup>Pb) and 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs using gamma spectrometry. Age-depth relationships for the past 100–150 years were calculated based on 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb activities and cumulative dry mass using the constant rate of 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb supply (CRS) dating model

 </sup>. Sediment ages beyond the 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb dating range were estimated based on 2
 <sup>nd</sup> order polynomial extrapolations of the 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb chronologies until ~1780. More specific information regarding lake and watershed characteristics and individual dating results are provided in earlier studies
