<p id="Par14">Acid deposition was the dominant stressor affecting lake-water DOC levels in Sudbury and likely other higher deposition areas over the past century, leading to the current widespread re-browning of lakes with reduced acid inputs. Compared to acid deposition, the relative impact of climate change on DOC concentrations appears to be considerably lower. However, in the ELA the current DOC increase has already surpassed pre-industrial background levels in most lakes, suggesting that climate is already the dominant driver of DOC change in low acid-deposition regions. In the past, the Sudbury region experienced similar environmental changes (increased annual air temperature by ~1.4 °C, increased rainfall by ~145 mm, and a longer growing and runoff season by ~21 days since the 1950s; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as the ELA. Consequently, these changes will also have contributed to the ongoing DOC increase in Sudbury lakes over the last decades

 </sup>. While we cannot differentiate between the co-occurring individual contributions of these environmental changes and reductions in acid deposition to the current DOC increase, our results from the low deposition ELA region suggest that the changing climate, together with the effects of acidification recovery, will lead to further increases in DOC concentrations, and also shift the post-acidification baseline above pre-industrial DOC levels in former high acid deposition regions. However, when identifying appropriate post-acidification DOC reference levels, particularly in more urban settings, it is important to also consider other human-induced environmental changes that have occurred since pre-industrial times that may affect the terrestrial and/or aquatic DOC supply (e.g., changes in vegetation cover and composition, infrastructure development, and lake eutrophication).
