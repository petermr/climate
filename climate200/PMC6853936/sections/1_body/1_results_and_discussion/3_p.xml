 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), showing the dominance of direct physicochemical changes in soil-solution chemistry rather than in-lake processes for the observed lake-water DOC changes. The largest relative DOC declines (&gt;60%) occurred in Middle Lake, located closest to Sudbury smelters (~5 km; no CaMg* measurements prior to liming) as well as in the most acid-sensitive lakes (George and Lumsden lakes, ~60 km distance to nearest smelters; CaMg* = 32–50 µeq L
