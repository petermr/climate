<p id="Par13">Significant changes in climate, however, occurred over the past century in the ELA, with increased rainfall by 160 mm and ~1.7 °C warmer mean annual air temperatures, prolonging the main growing and runoff season by ~17 days (i.e., days with temperatures above 0 °C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Warmer temperatures, increased vegetation cover and changes in hydrology have been linked to elevated DOC levels in freshwaters

 </sup>, and may explain the increasing DOC trend in ELA lakes since the 1930s. Although monitoring data show that these climate changes occurred mainly since the 1970s, the nearest longer-term meteorological record (Fort Snelling, Minnesota, Fig.

 </sup> suggests that temperatures in central North America were, on average, already warmer since the 1930s compared to the preceding 100 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). An earlier change of environmental conditions is supported by analyses of historical biological communities (diatoms, chrysophytes) in the study lakes, which indicate changing lake thermal properties (increasing thermal stability, warmer surface-water temperatures, shorter ice-covered season) and possibly increased DOC concentrations since the early-1900s
