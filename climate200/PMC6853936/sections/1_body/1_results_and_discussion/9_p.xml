<p id="Par15">Previous assessments attempting to determine browning patterns in lakes were hampered by relatively short periods of environmental monitoring. Not surprisingly, conclusions tended to focus on the browning process itself, often concluding that lakes are entering new ecological states. Our data provide new insights into the scale of long-term DOC changes associated with different stressors relative to pre-industrial levels. In a multiple stressor world, alternate scenarios of browning and re-browning likely exist, with the latter more common to regions that received moderate to high levels of acid deposition. These widespread fundamental changes in lakes may have large consequences for the biota in these ecosystems, as well as management implications for fisheries and drinking-water resources.</p>
