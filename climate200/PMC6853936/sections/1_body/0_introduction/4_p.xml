<p id="Par5">Sediment archives allow researchers to place recent environmental changes into a long-term perspective. Importantly, the few decades of overlap between monitoring and sediment records allow us to make quantitative comparisons between measured and sediment-inferred trends. Recent advances in analytical techniques now permit the inference of past DOC trends based on sediment visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy, a fast, inexpensive and non-destructive technique. Utilizing a calibration model between VNIR spectra of lake-surface sediments and corresponding surface-water DOC concentrations

However, while acid deposition could be identified as an important factor contributing to 20th-century DOC dynamics, centuries of anthropogenic landscape alterations in Scandinavia and their legacy effects on DOC dynamics confound identifying its individual contribution
