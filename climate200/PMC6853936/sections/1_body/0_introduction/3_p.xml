<p id="Par4">To determine the specific influence of acid deposition on lake-water DOC concentrations, we inferred long-term DOC trends from lake-sediment records over the past ~200 years, and compared these trends in lakes from historically low and high acid-deposition regions of central Canada. The Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario received relatively low acid inputs (8.1 kg SO

 <sup>−1</sup> in 1990–1998), whereas the Sudbury region in northeastern Ontario was heavily affected by acid deposition during the 20

 </sup>. Both regions are located in the Boreal Shield ecozone, and are characterized by northern mixed forests underlain by Precambrian Shield bedrock and glacial deposits. The study lakes in Sudbury and the ELA are oligotrophic (total phosphorus: 2.2–10.3 µg L
 <sup>−1</sup>), acidic to slightly alkaline (pH: 5.5–7.6), and small to medium-sized (lake area: 5–795 ha; Z

Annual temperature and precipitation averages (Canadian Climate Normals for 1981–2010) are 3.1 °C and 715 mm for Kenora, Ontario, ~50 km east of the ELA, and 4.1 °C and 903 mm for Sudbury. Smelting operations in Sudbury once represented one of the largest global point sources of atmospheric SO
