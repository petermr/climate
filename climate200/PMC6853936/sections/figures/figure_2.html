 <caption> Climate and atmospheric deposition trends for Kenora, ~50 km east of the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), and Sudbury, Ontario. Grey line plots indicate annual means, while blue lines represent 9-year running means. Slopes (annual change) and significance levels resulting from trend analyses are given for each variable. ( a) Mean annual air temperature. ( b) Mean annual precipitation. ( c) Mean annual rainfall. ( d) Days with temperatures above 0 °C. ( e) Annual atmospheric sulphate (SO 4 2−) deposition for the ELA (1971–2012), Killarney (~60 km southwest of Sudbury; 1978–1998) 22 and Dorset, Ontario (~220 km southeast of Sudbury; 1978–2013). ( f) Atmospheric Total Nitrogen (TN) deposition for the ELA (1970–2013) 39 and Dorset, Ontario (~220 km southeast of Sudbury; 1979–2013). </caption>
