 <caption> Regional lake-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) trends for the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) and Sudbury. ( a) Relative change in sediment-inferred DOC concentrations (black) compared to the mean pre-industrial (1780–1850) levels (dashed). Grey envelope indicates the standard deviation from the mean based on eight lake-sediment records for each region. ( b) Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions for the U.S.A. and Canada 30 (black) and for Sudbury (red) in mega tonnes (Mt). ( c) Mean annual air temperature (green, 9-year running mean in black) for Kenora, ~50 km east of the ELA, and Sudbury compared to the mean annual temperature anomaly for Fort Snelling, Minnesota (blue). ( d) Mean annual precipitation (green; 9-year running mean in black) for Kenora and Sudbury. </caption>
