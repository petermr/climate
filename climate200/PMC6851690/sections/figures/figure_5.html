 <caption> Time‐series data and population trends in two focal reindeer populations. Annual fluctuations in (a) rain‐on‐snow (ROS), (b) summer temperatures and (c) standardized reindeer population sizes, and the estimates of (d) population size trends (with varying trend starting year; whiskers showing 95% CI) over the period 1978–2015 in Brøggerhalvøya (blue; Ny‐Ålesund weather station) and Adventdalen (red; Svalbard Airport weather station). Horizontal dashed lines in (a) and (b) denote detected ‘regime shifts’, i.e. change points in mean. Population size trends in (c) are shown as solid lines, for the period after the irruptive phase in Brøggerhalvøya </caption>
