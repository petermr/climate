 <caption> Spatial synchrony in reindeer population parameters across Svalbard, and the impact of rain‐on‐snow (ROS). (a–c) Pairwise correlations between populations in (a) fecundity (proxy), (b) mortality (proxy) and (c) population growth rates during 1997–2015, as function of distance (see also Table S2). Note the different axes scales for the different population parameters. The thick solid line represents the smoothed spline function, while the average regional synchrony (i.e. mean correlation) and bootstrapped 90% confidence intervals are shown with dashed and dotted blue lines respectively. (d–f) Pairwise correlations between populations of residuals (when accounting for density‐dependent ROS effects; Table S1) of (d) fecundity, (e) mortality and (f) population growth rates, as functions of distance. (g–i) The contributions of the density‐dependent ROS effect to synchrony in (g) fecundity, (h) mortality and (i) population growth rates, shown as histograms of the difference in nonparametric bootstrap replicates of average synchrony ( n = 1,000) before and after accounting for the density‐dependent ROS effect. Thick (50%) and thin (5% and 95%) blue dashed lines illustrate the percentiles </caption>
