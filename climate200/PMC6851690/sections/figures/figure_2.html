 <caption> Time‐series data and trend estimates. Annual fluctuations and temporal trends in rain‐on‐snow (ROS) and reindeer population parameters in Svalbard are shown for the period used for population synchrony analyses (1997–2015). (a) Annual ROS (mm) recorded at five weather stations. (b–e) Annual reindeer fecundity (proxy), mortality (proxy), population sizes and growth rates based on summer ground and helicopter counts. (f, g) Linear trend estimates of ROS and reindeer population sizes over the study period. Whiskers indicate 95% confidence interval. In (a–e), solid black lines show ‘across Svalbard‐scale’ estimates from linear mixed regression models </caption>
