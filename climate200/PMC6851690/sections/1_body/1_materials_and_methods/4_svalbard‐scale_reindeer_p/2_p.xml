<p>Based on all 10 reindeer populations, we estimated overall annual abundances and vital rates, and their temporal trends. For consistency, and because most population time series were established in 1997, we restricted the study period to 1997–2015. Note that, because of missing years in some populations, simple averaging or adding of population sizes was not possible. For each population, we obtained annual proxies of ‘fecundity’ by dividing the number of calves by the total number of reindeer, and ‘mortality’ by dividing the number of carcasses by the total number of reindeer the previous year (see Peeters et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Note that carcass counts are likely to give underestimates of mortality rates, although presumably consistent between years. Annual estimates of the ‘across Svalbard‐scale’ fecundity and mortality (i.e. across all populations) were then obtained through linear mixed effects regression models of the local fecundity or mortality estimates (on a logit scale) as a function of year (as a fixed factor) and population (random intercept effect). These regressions were weighted by the population‐specific mean population size (over each time series) to allow larger populations to contribute more to the across Svalbard proxies than smaller ones. Estimates of across Svalbard‐scale proxies of relative abundance (‘population size’
