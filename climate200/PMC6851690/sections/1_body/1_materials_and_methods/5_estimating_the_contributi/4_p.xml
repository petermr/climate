<p>Although any (temporal variation in) spatially correlated monitoring efforts could ‘artificially’ increase the measured synchrony, the different monitoring methods between populations reduce this risk. For the counts performed on the ground, the accuracy seems relatively high (i.e. less biased and more precise; Le Moullec et al.,
