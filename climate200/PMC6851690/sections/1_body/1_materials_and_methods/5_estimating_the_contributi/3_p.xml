<p>Rain‐on‐snow and population density are clearly the main drivers of annual fluctuations in vital rates and abundance (Albon et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), and ROS and density effects may also interact (Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; see also Coulson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). More specifically, the ROS effect diminishes at very low population densities because available ice‐free patches per capita will anyways be sufficient, while at high densities, ‘all’ reindeer will suffer from a multiplicative effect of ROS on resource competition (Hansen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). We therefore tested the extent to which density‐dependent ROS effects contributed to the synchrony in fecundity, mortality and population growth rates by also estimating the correlations between populations 
 <italic>after</italic> accounting for this climate–density interaction effect, i.e. the correlations in model residuals. ROS

  <sub>t</sub>

 </italic> − April

  <sub>t</sub>

 <sub>+1</sub>), i.e. ln(mm precipitation + 1, to avoid log of zero) falling at temperatures ≥1°C. For each local population, we fitted generalized linear regression models of fecundity and mortality (quasi‐binomial family, logit link), and linear regression models of population growth rates, as functions of ROS

  <sub>t</sub>

 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we used a common ‘across Svalbard‐scale’ ROS

  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> estimate obtained from a linear mixed effects regression model of ROS
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> at the five weather stations as a function of year (as fixed factor), and with weather station as random intercept effect. The residuals from the population‐specific models of fecundity, mortality and population growth rates were then analysed for pairwise correlations and spatial synchrony across the range of distances. The contribution of density‐dependent ROS effects to the observed synchrony in fecundity, mortality and population growth was estimated based on the difference in nonparametric bootstrapped replicates of average synchrony (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,000) before and after accounting for the density‐dependent ROS effect.
