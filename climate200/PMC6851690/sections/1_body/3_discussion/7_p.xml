<p>Other snow pack changes than basal ice formation, notably snow depth (Tyler, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), may modify the effects of ROS events on winter‐feeding conditions (Peeters et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), and snowfall amount per se was also found to have a negative effect on both the Adventdalen and Brøggerhalvøya populations. Furthermore, a progressively longer snow‐free season (Albon et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and improved carrying capacity due to summer warming and ‘greening’ (which is likely highly autocorrelated in space; Milner, Stien, &amp; Van der Wal, 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) can have positive effects on population growth, both in the short and long run, as observed in Adventdalen (but see Fauchald et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref> for the low Arctic). As demonstrated in this study, the net effect of changes in environmental drivers linked with summer or winter warming could be expected to vary spatially due to local variation in climate trends and density‐dependent responses, decoupling
