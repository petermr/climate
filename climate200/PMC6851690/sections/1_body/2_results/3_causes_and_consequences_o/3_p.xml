<p>The differences in the relative magnitude of temporal change in ROS and summer temperature between populations contributed to the long‐term reindeer population trajectories in these two focal populations. Overall, the effects of local weather variables on population growth rates were broadly similar (i.e. similar signs, but with different strengths) in Adventdalen and on Brøggerhalvøya (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Thus, linear regression models (for a cross‐validation procedure, see Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>), which were run separately for each population due to the period/irruption factor on Brøggerhalvøya, suggested an overall negative ROS effect on population growth rates. The ROS effect was stronger at high reindeer densities, and, importantly, this interaction effect between ROS and density was stronger on Brøggerhalvøya than in Adventdalen (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In contrast, the positive effect of summer temperature was stronger in Adventdalen than on Brøggerhalvøya. Snowfall amount tended to have an overall negative effect, while there was no evidence of an influence of winter length in either population.
