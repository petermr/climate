<p>Can the same climate or weather parameters cause synchronous annual population dynamics while simultaneously causing diverging long‐term trends? Population growth rates were indeed positively correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> = .46, Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) between our two focal reindeer populations (i.e. Adventdalen [‘continental’] and Brøggerhalvøya [coastal], 126 km apart, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), from which we had both local weather data and long‐term, ground‐based count data. However, some small yet important differences in climate trends between these two populations have become evident since the 1990s (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a,b). Firstly, the linear regressions indicated a significant increase in the annual amount of ROS (on natural log‐scale) during 1978–2015 at the weather station on Brøggerhalvøya (i.e. Ny‐Ålesund; 
 <italic>β</italic> = .055, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 2.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but not at the station in Adventdalen (i.e. Svalbard Airport; 
 <italic>β</italic> = .030, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1.63, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .11). A regime shift with overall higher annual ROS since around year 2000 was detected in Ny‐Ålesund (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), but not at Svalbard Airport (see Peeters et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref> for a longer time span). Secondly, while linear regression models indicated a summer temperature increase over time for both Ny‐Ålesund (
 <italic>β</italic> = .028, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 3.09, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and Svalbard Airport (
 <italic>β</italic> = .053, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 4.85, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the slope was twice as steep at the latter station. Thus, a sudden regime shift with elevated summer temperature levels from around 1998 was detected at both weather stations, but in this case the increase was greater at Svalbard Airport (ca. 1.3°C) than in Ny‐Ålesund (ca. 0.9°C, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). We found no evidence for other differences between Adventdalen and Brøggerhalvøya in temporal trends of potential drivers of reindeer population growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), i.e. winter length (equally strong linear decrease in both areas) and total snowfall (no strong trends).
