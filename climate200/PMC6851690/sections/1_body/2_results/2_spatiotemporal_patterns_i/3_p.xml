<p>Rain‐on‐snow showed a high mean pairwise correlation between weather stations (

 <sub>ROS</sub> = 0.62 [95% confidence interval = 0.48, 0.76]), and the correlation decreased with distance (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Similarly, pairwise correlations between the reindeer populations in annual fecundity (mean pairwise correlation

 <sub>R</sub> = 0.23 [0.02, 0.43]) were generally positive and decreased with increasing distance between populations (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). When accounting for only an additive effect of ROS

 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.83 [0.76, 0.91]) and population growth rates (

 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.21 [0.01, 0.39]), but were lower for fecundity (
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.44 [0.28, 0.62]). However, when accounting for a density‐dependent ROS effect (

 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>, Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), correlations between populations were lower for population growth rates (
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.15 [−0.18, 0.48]) and, in particular, mortality (
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.67 [0.49, 0.88]), while less so for fecundity (
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.47 [0.26, 0.64]) (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d–f). Thus, based on whether the lower 5% percentile (i.e. an a priori expected change, ‘one‐tailed’) of the change in pairwise correlation obtained from bootstrapping was above or below zero (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14761-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g–i), this change in correlation due to the 
 <italic>N
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> × ROS
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> effect was far from ‘significant’ for fecundity (mean difference = 0.06 [−0.12, 0.26]), significant for mortality (0.44 [0.17, 0.79]) and marginally non‐significant for population growth rates (0.12 [−0.02, 0.25]). Note that synchrony models with other weather variables (analyses not presented) or with only density 
 <italic>N
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> included as covariate caused relatively little or no reduction in average regional synchrony (fecundity: 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.52 [0.31, 0.71]; mortality: 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.73 [0.60, 0.89]; population growth rates: 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>resid</sub> = 0.23 [0.01, 0.47]). Thus, we conclude that density‐dependent ROS effects were the main detected contributor to the observed synchrony in population dynamics, yet marginally non‐significant, and mainly operating through synchronization of mortality.
