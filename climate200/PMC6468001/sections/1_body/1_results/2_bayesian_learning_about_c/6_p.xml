<p id="Par17">Looking across scenarios, the flexible alternative is chosen most often in scenario A because discounting incentivizes delayed capital investments. This is not the case in scenario B because large economies of scale incentivize a single, large investment. In scenario C more modest economies of scale lead to high value of flexibility in the absence of discounting, highlighting differences in the value of flexibility across technologies. Across all scenarios, the flexible dam is expanded in no more than 10% of simulations, highlighting the low probability of reaching a climate that is hot and dry enough to incur substantial shortages.</p>
