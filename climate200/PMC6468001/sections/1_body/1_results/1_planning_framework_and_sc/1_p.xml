<p id="Par9">We demonstrate this planning framework, illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, with an application for Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the second largest city in Kenya with an estimated population of 1.1 million
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Urban water demand is currently estimated at 150,000 m
 <sup>3</sup>day
 <sup>−1</sup> and expected to grow to 300,000 m
 <sup>3</sup>day

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Mombasa has a warm, humid climate with average annual precipitation of 900 mm year
 <sup>−1</sup> and a mean annual temperature of 26 °C

 </sup>. While GCMs all project warming in the region, there is disagreement on the direction of precipitation change. This creates substantial uncertainty in future runoff and therefore the reservoir capacity needed to meet yield targets over its lifetime. We apply our framework to develop and assess a flexible infrastructure design. The flexible design enables extra storage capacity to be added if the initial dam becomes insufficient due to warmer, drier climates.
