<p id="Par42">CLIRUN II is calibrated using 14 years of monthly streamflow data. Only one streamflow gauge, RGS 3MA03, is available in the Mwache basin

 </sup>. However, it is directly upstream of the dam location, making it representative for this study. The same monthly temperature and precipitation data from CRU used in the Bayesian climate analysis is used to calibrate CLIRUN II for consistency. This temperature and precipitation data is different than the local data used in the previous World Bank study
