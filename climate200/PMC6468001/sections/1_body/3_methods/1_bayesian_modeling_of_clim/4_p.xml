 </sup>. Because our ultimate goal is to update our learning of regional climate in the Mwache catchment with respect to multi-decadal trends in precipitation and temperature, we choose to weight GCMs based on their performance in reproducing multi-decadal trends of precipitation and temperature averaged over the catchment area. Therefore, to implement the Bayesian uncertainty analysis in Mombasa, we use a total of 21 CMIP5 members whose modeling group and model run are included in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The 21 GCM simulations come from 10 different institutions and 15 different GCMs, with three GCMs providing more than one simulation. Models were selected based on the most readily available models at the time of the analysis, with 21 being in line with previous studies, providing a reasonable balance between computational limits and model diversity

 </sup>. All models are forced by the RCP 8.5 scenario, which is the high emissions scenario from the IPCC AR5. For each GCM, monthly temperature and precipitation values are averaged over 2–6°S and 38–42°E, overlaying the Mwache catchment; GCM projections are regridded from their original resolution following the approach in
