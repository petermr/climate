<p id="Par23">We extend the previous Bayesian model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> in three ways. First, we apply the model to annually averaged 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>T</italic> values separately, assuming that 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> are independent. This reflects that a model’s performance in estimating 
 <italic>T</italic> may be unrelated to its ability to estimate 
 <italic>P</italic>. Second, we apply the model to observed and projected change in 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> (i.e. Δ
 <italic>T</italic> and %Δ
 <italic>P</italic>) rather than absolute 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic> due to greater model skill in GCM projected changes in temperature and precipitation rather than absolute values
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. This is especially important in our application in Mombasa where there is less disagreement in temperature change than there is disagreement in hind-casted absolute temperature.
