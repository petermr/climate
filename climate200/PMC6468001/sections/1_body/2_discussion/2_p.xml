<p id="Par20">The results in the Mombasa application demonstrate the nuances and tradeoffs inherent in comparing flexible and robust approaches for planning under climate uncertainty. Although the uncertainty and learning is driven by the climate system, decisions about whether flexibility is a valuable tool in mitigating risk are strongly influenced by social, technological, and economic factors. The large economies of scale in earthen dams make flexibility less valuable; it is better to choose a robust alternative when it is not much more expensive to do so. Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination, however, is an inherent modular technology with modest economies of scale, lending itself more readily to flexible planning. The discount rate, which trades off future adaptation goals for immediate rewards, promotes flexible approaches. Flexibility often delays investment, which can be especially impactful in resource-scarce areas where unused capital could support other critical infrastructure services. The value society places on access to reliable, sustainable water supplies, and the damage of short-term outages is also influential.</p>
