<p id="Par21">Future extensions to other planning problems which have differences in degree and nature of uncertainty, hydrological sensitivity to climate change, and social context can be used to assess under what conditions flexible or static planning approaches are more appropriate. Future work combining this learning approach with bottom-up vulnerability assessments can address the limitations of GCM-based probability distributions

 </sup>. This framework shows promise in identifying areas where smaller, flexible infrastructure is reliable vs. those that require a traditional static approach, enabling billions of dollars of potential savings in climate change adaptation investments across civil infrastructure domains.
