<p id="Par19">We develop a method that integrates iterative Bayesian learning about climate uncertainty into a multi-stage stochastic infrastructure planning model in order to address a critical limitation of adaptive infrastructure planning in both water supply and other domains: estimating upfront how much planners can expect to learn about climate change in the future and therefore whether adaptive approaches are likely to be reliable and cost effective. Our approach quantifies, for example, the extent to which a wet trajectory over the next 20 years increases the likelihood of a wet trajectory 40 years into the future. By applying the Bayesian model to a wide range of discrete virtual future climate observations, we develop adaptive policies that take into account all future opportunities for learning. While all approaches that use GCM ensembles face limitations, this approach provides a reasonable quantitative estimate of future learning that enables better-informed assessment of tradeoffs between planning approaches. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of flexible planning, which relies on learning processes that remain unquantified in previous methods, rather than assuming a priori that flexibility is a worthwhile planning goal. This is especially important for infrastructure planning where planners must prepare in advance to take a flexible approach due to the large, irreversible nature of infrastructure investments.</p>
