 </sup>. A challenge faced by the aforementioned approaches is the difficulty in assessing opportunities to learn in the future. General circulation model (GCM, i.e. climate model) projections provide us with the best available estimates of how the global climate system will evolve under a given emissions scenario. However, as time passes and new climate observations are available, some GCM trajectories will prove to be more reliable than others. For example, suppose current regional projections estimate a range between 0.5 and 1.5 °C of change over the next 20 years. If after 20 years we observe 1.5 °C of change, this suggests the climate is warming in this region more rapidly than expected. We may now shift our projections of change upward for the following 20 years. While existing frameworks provide an iterative process for planners to change course in the future, they do not provide an upfront assessment of the opportunity to learn about climate change in the future. This upfront assessment is critical to deciding whether investments in flexibility are worthwhile or whether a traditional static approach is more appropriate. Existing flexible approaches either assume a priori that flexibility is needed
