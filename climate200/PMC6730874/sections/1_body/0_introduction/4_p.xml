<p>The first objective of this study was to determine whether the population characteristics and migration timing of adult spotted salamanders (
 <italic>Ambystoma maculatum</italic>), which migrate annually from terrestrial burrows to shallow, lentic habitats [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], responded to annual climate variation over a 23-year study. We specifically evaluated whether 1) the number of returning adults, 2) male to female sex ratios, 3) body size and 4) migration timing have responded to annual variation in climate during the seasonally active (spring migration and breeding; summer growth and larval metamorphosis) versus non-active (winter) times of the year. The second objective was to determine whether any of these attributes exhibited long-term population-level shifts, given the global patterns of rising temperatures and precipitation change associated with climate change.
