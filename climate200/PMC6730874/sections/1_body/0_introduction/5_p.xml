<p>We made four explicit predictions regarding the four attributes of migrating spotted salamander populations based on previously documented effects of climate on amphibians. First, we predicted that warm temperatures and low precipitation would result in small numbers of returning adults, given that higher thermal stress, desiccation, and hydrologic alterations have all been correlated with amphibian population declines [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Second, we predicted that warm temperatures and low precipitation would lead to skewed sex ratios with high abundances of males because females have lower probabilities of migrating when migration period conditions are suboptimal [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Third, we predicted that warm temperatures and low precipitation would lead to small salamander body sizes, due to the potential for increased metabolic rates [
