<p>Climate change impacts are likely to be profound for amphibians because they are ectothermic with life cycles and life history attributes that are tightly linked to climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Temperature regulates metabolic processes for amphibians, and increasing temperatures should result in higher energetic expenditures, decreased growth rates, and lower resource allocation during overwintering periods [

For amphibians that inhabit shallow, non-permanent wetlands (e.g., ponds and marshes), the hydroperiod of these habitats is tightly linked to patterns in snowmelt, seasonal rainfall, or evapotranspiration rates, all of which are predicted to change survival, recruitment, and population size [
