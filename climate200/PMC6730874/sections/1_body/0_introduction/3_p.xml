<p>Despite the sensitivity of amphibians to changes in climate, it has been difficult to make generalizations about the consequences of climate change because of species- and population-level differences in physiology, life history, and habitat use [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which make it difficult to predict amphibian responses to climate change and establish effective conservation strategies [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, there are considerable differences in how climate variables (temperature, precipitation, seasonal extremes) are changing at the local scale across different geographical regions as compared to trends at the global scale [
