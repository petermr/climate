<p>We sorted climate data into three ‘climatic periods’ of interest: climate conditions during the active summer season (hottest period), the non-active winter season (coldest period), and during the active spring migration. Summer (SU) was defined as the period from June 21-September 20 and winter (WI) was defined as the period from December 21-March 20. We focus on summer and winter conditions in particular because we expect these seasons to be the most thermally stressful [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The springtime migration period (SM) was defined as the period in which 95% of all salamanders were captured. Using the 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles eliminated the potential of outliers with very early migration dates from having an influence on results [

 <sup>th</sup> percentiles were highly correlated with first observed migration dates for males and females (both

 <sup>th</sup> percentiles had higher performance when predicting migration timing compared with first migration date. We only focus on the Spring migration period rather than the entire Spring season because 1) of the importance of local climate conditions during the actual migration period (e.g., precipitation; [
