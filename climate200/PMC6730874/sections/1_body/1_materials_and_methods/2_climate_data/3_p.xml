<p>We calculated the mean and the coefficient of variation (CV) for both minimum daily temperature and daily precipitation in the three ‘climatic periods’ to be used as predictor variables for the population-level response variables. The coefficient of variation was considered for these variables because seasonal climate variability may be important for explaining amphibian population trends [

Minimum daily temperatures were selected as the temperature metric because 1) minimum temperatures (i.e., nightly temperatures) are likely to be more important to the physiology and movements of nocturnal, fossorial amphibians like spotted salamanders [
