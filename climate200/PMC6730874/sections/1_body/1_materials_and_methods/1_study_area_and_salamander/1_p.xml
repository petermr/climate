<p>Spotted salamander populations were monitored annually during a 23-year period from 1995–2017 at the Bousson Environmental Research Reserve (BERR) in northwestern Pennsylvania. The reserve is a mixed deciduous-conifer old growth forest that has seen minimal to no habitat loss during the past century. Spotted salamanders were annually monitored at five ponds (41.598°, -80.042°;
