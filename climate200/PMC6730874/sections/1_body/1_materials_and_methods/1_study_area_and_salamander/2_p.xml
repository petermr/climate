<p>Adult spotted salamanders were captured during annual migrations from February to May using aluminum drift fences and pitfall traps. Separate fences surrounded ponds P1and P2, P3 and P4, and P5 (

Pitfall traps consisted of 4-liter buckets that were buried flush to the ground and positioned along the fences every 3–5 meters. Although the migration period varied from year to year, pitfall traps were opened on evenings with forecasted precipitation in late winter–early spring after the ground had largely thawed and ice had melted off the ponds, as these are important stimulants for spotted salamander movement [

We checked the traps each morning at daybreak (5:00–7:00) and recorded the trap location (pond), date, sex, body weight (g), total length (mm), and snout-vent length (SVL; mm) for all individuals. All salamanders were then released into the pond corresponding to their trap location. Handling and processing of salamanders was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Allegheny College.
