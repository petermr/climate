<p>Differences in the nature of each response variable required specifying different error distributions across the generalized linear models [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We used a negative binomial model (glm.nb function; R v.3.2.3) for discrete count data because annual abundance was highly over-dispersed (i.e., variance was very large relative to the mean). Similarly, the discrete data associated with migration date (day of year) and migration window length (number of days) were modeled with a Poisson distribution and a log-link function. Sex ratios and body sizes were analyzed with a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Model residuals and response variables were tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilks test and diagnostic plots were visually evaluated to ensure the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality for linear models were not violated. The CV of winter temperatures and the CV of migration period temperatures were log-transformed to meet these assumptions. Residual variation in models did not display any patterns of temporal autocorrelation, and thus we did not need to account for autocorrelation within the structure of these models.
