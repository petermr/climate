<p>Candidate models were evaluated using Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AIC
 <sub>c</sub>) because the response variable to predictor ratio was small [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Best candidate models for each time-lag analysis were ranked according to ΔAIC
 <sub>c</sub> (low values being better fit) and Akaike weights (
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>i</sub>). We only considered models with 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> ≥ 0.1 for interpretation. We calculated an evidence ratio (ER; [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) by dividing the top ranked models 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> by the second ranked models 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> for each time-lag. The ER provides an estimate for the likelihood of the hypotheses associated with the top ranked model over the hypotheses of the second ranked mode, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of support for the first model over the second. We also calculated pseudo-
 <italic>R</italic>-squared values for the best candidate Poisson and negative binomial models to quantify the amount of variation in salamander population characteristics explained by climatic variables. The significance level of all tests was set to α &lt; 0.05.
