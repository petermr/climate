<p>We also tested for time-lag effects in abundance, body size, and sex ratios to better evaluate the potential for delayed changes yet to be observed in population characteristics, since climatic effects may not be immediate [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We thus performed three separate information-theoretic analyses for these population characteristics: one for seasonal climatic conditions prior to spring migrations (
 <italic>t</italic>), one for seasonal conditions two years prior to annual migrations (
 <italic>t</italic>– 2), and one for seasonal conditions three years prior (
 <italic>t</italic>– 3). Models were only compared for the same time-lag and not across time-lags because sample sizes differed for each approach (i.e., data on springtime migration conditions were not available for the years prior to beginning our study). Two- and three-year time-lags were tested because this is the time to sexual maturity for spotted salamanders [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Finally, we also included abundance as a covariate in models testing for body size effects, since density-dependent effects may be more important than climate for explaining body size changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. All candidate models considered are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222097.s003">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222097.s004">S2</xref> Tables. All of the climate variables were treated as fixed effects and none were highly correlated with each other (all Pearson’s |
 <italic>r</italic>| ≤ 0.54).
