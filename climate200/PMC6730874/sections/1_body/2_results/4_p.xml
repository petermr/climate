The top ranked model for female body size with no time-lags included all summer climate variables, which had 8.9 times more support than the second ranked model. Notably, the coefficient of variation in summer minimum temperature was a strong predictor of both male and female body sizes, with high variations in summer temperatures correlated with small body sizes of males (
