<p>Although we did not observe a trend towards earlier migration dates across the 23 years in the ARMA models, winter temperatures had a significant effect on migration timing (
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Both males (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.59, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and females (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.38, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) were more likely to migrate early following warm winters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Coefficient of variation in minimum winter temperatures also had a significant effect on migration timing, with high variability (i.e., uncertainty) in winter temperatures associated with early migrations for females (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.47, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and males (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.53, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The coefficient of variation in precipitation during the migration period was the most consistent predictor of migration window length, and was positively associated with the breeding window length of both male (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.42, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and female salamanders (pseudo-
 <italic>R
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.37, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Hence, large variation in precipitation associated with more periods of no rainfall resulted in more migration delays.
