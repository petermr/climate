<p>There were no long-term shifts in sex ratios, body size or migration timing of spotted salamanders across the 23-year study based on the ARMA models (all 
 <italic>P</italic> ≥ 0.105). There was a weak trend of increasing abundance in male salamanders across the study period (value = increase of 11.6 males per year, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 2.15, SE = 5.42, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.044), but no trend for female salamanders (value = 5.7, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1.64, SE = 3.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.116; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Despite increasing summer minimum temperatures across the study period (value = 1.0°C increase per decade; 
 <italic>t</italic> = 2.45, SE = 0.03, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.023; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), there was no increase in winter temperatures (value = -0.1, 
 <italic>t</italic> = -0.39, SE = 0.19, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.699; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The only other climatic change observed through time was decreasing variability in summer precipitation (value = -0.02, 
 <italic>t</italic> = -3.69, SE = 0.01, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). To better evaluate changes during the winter-spring transition period when the salamanders migrate, we evaluated trends in minimum temperature and precipitation during 30 days prior and 30 days after the median arrival date of salamanders for each year. There was again no increase in minimum temperatures (value = 0.06, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1.55, SE = 0.04, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.136) or a change in precipitation (value = 0.01, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0.14, SE = 0.03, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.894; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) during the winter-spring transition when migration occurs.
