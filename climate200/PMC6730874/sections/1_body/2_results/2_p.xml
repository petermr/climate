<p>The annual abundance of migrating adults was most consistently explained by the amount of precipitation during the migration period (

  <sup>2</sup>

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222097.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which was 45 times better supported than the second ranked model. There was also a negative relationship between variability in summer precipitation and migrant abundance for the three-year time-lag (pseudo-
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.21, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021) and a weak positive effect of minimum previous summer temperatures on migrant abundance (pseudo-
