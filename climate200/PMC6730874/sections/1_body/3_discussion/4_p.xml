<p>Similar patterns were observed for how inter-annual variation in climate influence body size, despite the absence of an overall body size shift during the study period (

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] used biophysical modeling to show that salamander metabolic expenditure has increased through time due to rising temperatures, and thermal stress is a likely physiological mechanism for body size reductions. However, maximum summer temperatures across all study years (range: 24.2–28.1°C) never approached the reported thermal critical maxima for spotted salamanders and were thus probably rarely thermally stressed (~35°C [
