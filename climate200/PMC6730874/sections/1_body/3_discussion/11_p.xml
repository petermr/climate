<p>In conclusion, more attention should be given to understanding how seasonal climate change differences can explain the responsiveness of amphibians to climate change. Many studies have identified climate-induced changes in amphibians, which reflect the sensitivity of this taxonomic group to climatic factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite that sensitivity, idiosyncratic responses are prevalent throughout the literature because the responsiveness of a given species to climate change will depend on how the ecology of the species (e.g., phenology, life history) interacts with climatic changes at a given location [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Linking fine-scale, localized climatic changes (e.g., seasonal) to species or populations should thus improve our ability to explain why there is so much variation in responses across amphibian taxa [
