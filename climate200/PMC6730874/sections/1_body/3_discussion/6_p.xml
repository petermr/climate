<p>The strongest response we observed was a significant negative relationship between salamander body size and within-year fluctuations in summer temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222097.g003">Fig 3</xref>), a climate variable that has not experienced a change through time (value = -0.02, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0.38, SE = 0.01, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.712). Although the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unknown, one hypothesis is that the energetic costs associated with maintaining optimal metabolic temperatures should be higher under fluctuating rather than constant external temperatures. Amphibians have low resting metabolic rates, which make them well adapted for storing energetic reserves [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, alternating between high and low metabolic states or constantly acclimating across temperatures could require significant energetic expenditure and can have profound physiological consequences during both active and hibernation periods [

Identifying the mechanisms of how climate change and temperature variability within seasons impacts the physiology and body size of amphibians is likely to be important for understanding how climate variability affects amphibians (e.g., seasonal extremes; [
