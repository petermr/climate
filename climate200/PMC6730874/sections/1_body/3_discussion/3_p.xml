<p>The consequences of altered migration timing include a decoupling of community dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and asynchrony in the arrival time of sexes [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is well documented that male ambystomatid salamanders arrive earlier than females to breeding ponds [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and that males and females have different temperature thresholds for initiating migration [
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Given that higher variability in migratory precipitation and temperature cues resulted in longer breeding windows (i.e., migratory delays; 
 <xref rid="pone.0222097.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), extended dry periods in the early versus late migration window will have disproportional effects on each sex. Extended drying during migrations may be most likely to affect the migration of females, which frequently skip breeding during years of sub-par migration conditions (i.e., low precipitation; [

 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). However, in our study, the pattern of early arrival during warm winters was very similar for males and females (
