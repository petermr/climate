<p>A striking difference between our results and those of other studies with ectothermic taxa is the absence of a multi-decadal trend towards advanced migration timing [

We observed early salamander migrations in warm winters, which is consistent with the prediction that long-term warming would lead to earlier migration. However, we did not observe a long-term warming trend during winter at our study site (
