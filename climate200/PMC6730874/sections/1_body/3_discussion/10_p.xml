 <xref rid="pone.0222097.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] will be critical in helping ecologists formulate stronger inferences about climate-induced changes in amphibians. Although a caveat of our study is that we only evaluated a single species at a single location, our results are in general agreement with the conclusion of strong idiosyncratic responses in amphibians. Even though spotted salamanders were highly responsive to annual variation in seasonal climate, the absence of consistent long-term changes in important climatic variables appears to have precluded long-term changes in population characteristics and migration timing.
