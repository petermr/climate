  <title>Trends and relationships between seasonal climatic variables and salamander population characteristics.</title>
  <p>Annual variation in winter-spring transition precipitation (A), minimum winter temperatures (C), and minimum summer temperatures (E). Variation in the total numbers of male (closed circles) and female (open circle) salamander migrants as a function of migration period precipitation (B). The migration start date for male (closed circles) and female (open circles) salamanders based on the 95
   <sup>th</sup> percentile arrival day of year (DOY) as a function of minimum previous winter temperature (D). Male (closed circles) and female (open circles) snout-vent lengths (SVL) as a function of minimum previous summer temperatures (F).
