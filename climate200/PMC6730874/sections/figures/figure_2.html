 <caption> Trends and relationships between seasonal climatic variables and salamander population characteristics. Annual variation in winter-spring transition precipitation (A), minimum winter temperatures (C), and minimum summer temperatures (E). Variation in the total numbers of male (closed circles) and female (open circle) salamander migrants as a function of migration period precipitation (B). The migration start date for male (closed circles) and female (open circles) salamanders based on the 95 th percentile arrival day of year (DOY) as a function of minimum previous winter temperature (D). Male (closed circles) and female (open circles) snout-vent lengths (SVL) as a function of minimum previous summer temperatures (F). </caption>
