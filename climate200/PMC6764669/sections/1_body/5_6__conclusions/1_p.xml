<p>Perhaps one of the main findings of this study is that impacts on yields, even large ones, produced by changing climate patterns do not necessarily translate to large impacts in population suffering food insecurity. This result has a direct implication for food security policies in the context of climate change. Advances in crop sciences, like improvements in heat and drought tolerance of major crops represent a very important contribution to the resilience of global agri-food systems. These scientific advances should also help in the expansion of the agricultural frontier as both yields and area continue to contribute to the required increases of food production towards 2050 and beyond [

This research shows that the best way to reduce poor householdsâ€™ vulnerability to climate change is to affect those variables that reduce vulnerability more broadly. In the case of Peru, these policies are those that have been generally emphasized in the literature before the rise in CC awareness, like investment in public goods (education and infrastructure) as a way to alleviate market imperfections, while supporting the most vulnerable population with well-targeted social protection schemes. In other word, CC does not appear to change the best strategies to combat vulnerability to hunger, and these strategies are country/context specific.
