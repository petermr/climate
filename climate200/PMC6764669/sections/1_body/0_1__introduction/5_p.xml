<p>Micro studies, link with varying degrees of sophistication the impacts of climate on welfare by fitting microeconomic models using household surveys and weather or climate information, and mimic the impacts of climate change by simulating shocks on weather variables. In Nicaragua, for example, a low-latitude country, additional warming of average temperatures has a significant negative impact on household agricultural income, as well as food security vulnerability [

 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] found that households, particularly in semi-arid regions were vulnerable to negative precipitation shocks; and also, in a finding related to what is argued in this paper, found that across regions, those with less assets were more vulnerable to weather shocks. [
