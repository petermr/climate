 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These models generally predict future weather with General Circulation Models, which impact agricultural yields through Global Gridded Crop Models, which in turn affect Global Economic Models that make predictions about income and food consumption [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A good summary of what we learn from these models is available in [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, a few highlights are important to stress here. Yields are expected to rise (particularly when carbon fertilization is included) in some global regions and fall in others, but the overall global net (average) effect appears to be negative, as a result of the marginal effect of CC. This is in spite of the fact that overall towards 2050, both area and yields are expected to continue their historical trends of growth. Models tend to agree that the most serious impacts on FS are expected to occur in low latitude areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Crop-specific yields are predicted to fall as much as 30% [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as a result of CC, however, after allowing for these models to predict reallocation of area and crops, the overall net (marginal) impact on yields is more centered around (negative) 7–10% [
