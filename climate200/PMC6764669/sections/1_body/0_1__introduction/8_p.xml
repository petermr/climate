<p>In the work presented below, we estimate the impact of CC on agricultural yields, and find results consistent and fully bounded within what the literature that performs global simulations has found (i.e. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), with yields falling up to 20% in some regions. However, we show that these drops (and increases) in yields translate to much smaller changes in food consumption, and also surprisingly, to very minor impacts on vulnerability to food insecurity. The document explores what explains this surprising result, showing that characteristics that are specific to Peru, but also household and market mediating mechanisms more generally, explain how changes in yields, and corresponding farm incomes have a reduced impact in vulnerability to food insecurity.
