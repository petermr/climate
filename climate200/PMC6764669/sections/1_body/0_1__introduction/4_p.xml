<p>On the other hand, we learn from the Global Gridded Crop Models, that the weather data derived from global circulation models (and other similar approaches) produce very poor predictions that are highly divergent from that obtained from control real weather data [

The other criticism widely posed against these global models relates to its scale of analysis, they are unable to disentangle what are believed to be important sub-national variations in the impacts [

Hence, these models cannot inform local policymaking in terms of identifying the types of households most at risk, or the most successful adaptation practices on the ground. This is the type of microanalysis carried by another (smaller) strand of the literature to which this paper contributes.
