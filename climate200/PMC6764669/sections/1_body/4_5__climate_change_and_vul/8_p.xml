<p>The table of the main determinants of vulnerability offers some clear policy access-points. The two primary characteristics, rate of economic dependence of the household and agricultural household (the rate of economic dependence is the ratio of household members that do not work over to the total number of people in the household), are the result of rural markets that are not completely developed. If the labor markets and agricultural products markets functioned perfectly (instead of working imperfectly due to communication, information, and/or infrastructure failures), it should not be significant whether the household was or was not agricultural, but only the quantity of perceived income (monetary and non-monetary) would matter. In this case as we are controlling for income sources (farm and non-farm), in the probit model, the large impact of being an agricultural household is larger than the value of all the agricultural income generated. If labor markets worked perfectly farmers would assign effort to farm and non-farm activities such as to equate marginal returns, and it would not matter the source of income. The economic dependence (proportion of the members of the household who don’t earn income) is an indicator of a lack of employment, which could be due to little job creation or poor integration of labor markets, for example due to poor infrastructure and communications, and the stage of the demographic transition of Peru. Household size is more difficult to interpret, it can be an indication that rural households prefer to have larger households, or that they do not have access to family planning services. There is an extensive discussion of this in the literature, see for example, (López and Valdés 2000). Infrastructure availability (index), living in the rainforest, and sierra regions, reinforces the message about the importance of infrastructure and where it is most needed: in the Andes and the Amazonian rainforest. The public policies of social protection are also important, when they are well targeted (e.g. soup kitchens), and education is important but requires a focalized intervention on the most vulnerable which many times respond with school absenteeism as a household strategy (to supplement labor shortages in the household).</p>
