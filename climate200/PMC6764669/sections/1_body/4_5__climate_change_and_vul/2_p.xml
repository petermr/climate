<p>Peru possesses fundamental characteristics that strengthen its resilience when facing climate change: the agro-climatic heterogeneity and the diversification of income generating activities. First, the agro-climatic heterogeneity of Peru means that the changes in climatic variables do not imply a univocal relationship between climate and agricultural productivity. To the contrary, it implies the coexistence of gaining and losing eco-regions in terms of agricultural yields (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), these gains and losses countervail each other giving way to a moderate mean national impact, the same occurs at the department level of each eco-region. Additionally, this agro-climatic heterogeneity occurs within small geographic areas, which offers high potential for adaptation. In realizing the simulation, we assume that the farmers produce the same crops that they produced before, ignoring the potential for adaptation of their farming strategies. However, this assumption is not realistic, it is highly likely that an adaptive response to changes in climate exists for crops, either through intensified use of land for crops benefited by the climate or by changing the choice of crops produced, by altering the timing of agricultural activities, among other adaptive agricultural practices, [
