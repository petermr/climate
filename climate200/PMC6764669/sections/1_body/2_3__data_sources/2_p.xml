<p>The ENAHO (National Household Survey) allows us to satisfy the information requirements related to the measurement of: i) agricultural productivity, ii) food security, iii) factors that determine vulnerability to food insecurity of rural households. Information is obtained from the survey modules related to agricultural and livestock production (and related incomes): agricultural, livestock, and forest production, the input costs, and related variables (number, size, and use of parcels, tenure, and irrigation system, for example). Based on this information, we construct the key variables for the agricultural productivity model: production, yields, prices, and value of production indexes, using TÃ¶rnqvist indexes. The reference period for agricultural income is the last 12 months. Additionally, we use available information about the socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural profiles of the rural household as explanatory factors of vulnerability to food insecurity.</p>
