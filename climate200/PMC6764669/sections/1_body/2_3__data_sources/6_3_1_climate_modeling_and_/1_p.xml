<p>The climate data used here is a new dataset of climate projections for Peru, derived from the downscaling [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] of global climate projections of three Earth System Models (ESMs) from the Fifth Assessment of the IPCC [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The statistical downscaling of climate projections for different Green House Gases (GHG) emissions scenarios was carried out by the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service of Peru (SENAMHI) for the purpose of this study [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three ESMs used are CanESM2 (Canadian Earth System Model), CNRM-CM5 (National Meteorological Research Center of France) and MPI-ESM-MR (Max Planck Institute for Meteorology). The global temperature and precipitation projections on coarse grids through the year 2099 at the daily scale under two GHG (greenhouse gases) concentration scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways—RCP4.5 and 8.5) were statistically downscaled to weather station locations in Peru after calibration with historical meteorological data (1971–2010). The calibration of statistical methods used 105 stations for maximum temperatures, 102 stations for minimum temperatures, and 265 stations for precipitation. These stations were selected after taking into account a percentage of lost, missing, or non-collected data in the period 1971–2000 and 1981–2010 below 20%.
