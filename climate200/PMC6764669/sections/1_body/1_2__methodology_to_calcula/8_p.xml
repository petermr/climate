<p>In the second step expected household food consumption and its variability is estimated. In this case, heteroscedasticity of consumption is expected,

 <italic>e</italic>. variance is not constant, but rather it reveals the level of vulnerability of a household due to the variability of expected consumption, which instead of being constant, as traditional econometrics assumes, is specific to the household. In the second step (II) we approach said heteroscedasticity utilizing Just and Pope’s model, which estimates both equations i) Caloric consumption equation and ii) Variance of caloric consumption equation in its log-linear form by generalized least squares, GLS (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222483.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In this work, we estimate both models jointly by maximum likelihood, which is equivalent to iterating Just and Pope’s recursive model until the regression parameters converge, see details in [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is important to stress that this methodology not only deals with the problem of heteroscedasticity, but also deals with the perhaps a more relevant problem, the endogeneity of the variance of expected consumption.
