<p>In this work we address the potential impact of CC on social welfare by modeling and measuring how changes in weather patterns alter agricultural productivity and how these impacts ultimately affect food security. We study the impact of climate change through agriculture both for the importance the sector has on the economies of rural households, 75% of which declare agricultural incomes, and because it is expected to be one of the economic activities most affected by CC. The impact of CC on agriculture will be strongly related to the characteristics of each socioeconomic system, as well as the mitigation and adaptation capacity those systems [

For example, a reduction in the amount of precipitation or a change in its distribution will likely affect more those households which are more dependent on rainfed agriculture as opposed to those who have access to irrigation infrastructure.
