<p>Empirically, the caloric deficit differs considerably from the vulnerability as can be observed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The groups that present caloric deficit or vulnerability, but not both at the same time, represent 14.8% and 16.3% of the population respectively. While the proportion of vulnerable households and those that suffer caloric deficits are a similar quantity +/- 33% of the population, they are distinct groups as almost half of the vulnerable population did not experience caloric deficit in 2012.
