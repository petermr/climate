<p>Here we focus on the vulnerability results, but it is important to note that the impacts on caloric deficits are more pronounced. In the base line, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, the sierra (Andes region) presents the highest average probabilities of being undernourished (30â€“40%), in contrast with the coast, where the probability ranges between 22 and 25%. On the coast, the lower vulnerability is explained by the fact that the population is located closer to urban centers and enjoys higher public infrastructure development, among other factors that diminish vulnerability.
