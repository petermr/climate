 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows that the observed changes in vulnerability as a result of the climate simulations, both nationally, and at the regional levels are very small. Under the moderate 4.5 scenario countrywide vulnerability hardly changes on average, -0.09% (0.03% inter climate model mean, with 0.1% standard deviation). However, opening the average to geographic regions, a decrease in vulnerability is observed on the coast and the mountainsâ€”both zones experience an increase in agricultural yields under this model. Likewise, the selva / jungle region shows an increase in the observed vulnerability, a result in line with the fact that the rainforest is the only region where there is a predicted decrease in yields in the moderate emissions growth scenario.
