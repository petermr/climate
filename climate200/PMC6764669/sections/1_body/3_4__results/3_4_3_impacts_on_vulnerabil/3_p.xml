<p>To measure the effect of climate on vulnerability the predicted climate from the climatic simulation models was used (see details above). The climate affects food consumption through agricultural yields, agricultural income, and production for own-consumption. The climatic model presented throughout this section is CanES in the two GHG emission scenarios, moderate climate change 4.5 and greater than expected climate change 8.5.</p>
