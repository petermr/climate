<p>The results of the impacts of CC on vulnerability are not univocal; the impacts depend on how the climate affects the crops typical to the area (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, the result that climate change has a very moderate effect on vulnerability to food insecurity is one of the most robust and relevant result presented in this study. This result of moderate impact is robust across climate models as can be checked in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222483.s015">S14</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222483.s016">S15</xref> Tables. Nevertheless, this result should not be interpreted as climate change not having a considerable impact on agricultural yields (and their corresponding incomes, as shown above), but rather that the transmission to food consumption of this impact is lessened by a series of factors that mediate the relationship between agricultural productivity and food security, as is discussed in the next section.
