<p>The estimation of this agricultural productivity model is done through ordinary least squares, and includes agricultural producers: 32,466 observations with complete information. The impact of distinct groups of variables on productivity is briefly discussed. The agricultural inputs, as expected, are key to crop yields, principally labor, variable inputs and physical capital; and, as expected diminishing returns to scale are estimated. All the continuous variables of agricultural inputs of farming households are expressed per-unit (ha) of agricultural (operated) land to indicate the intensity in the use of inputs. Spending on hired labor is positive and significant, but not the number of household workers. Additionally, agricultural spending is positive and significant, signaling the importance of variables inputs: fertilizers, and other agrochemical products. Physical capital is approximated from variables such as, animals, motorized vehicles and an (local area) infrastructure index. Both the infrastructure and household assets index, are principal components indices. The infrastructure index is composed of indicators of connectivity and proximity to services, like distance to health center, telephone and electricity connection, and public trash collection services. The presence of motorized vehicles and the infrastructure index presents a positive effect on the yield per hectare, however no type of animal appears to be related to agricultural productivity.</p>
