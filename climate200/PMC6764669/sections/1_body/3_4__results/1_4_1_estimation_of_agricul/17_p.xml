<p>Through the present model, the climatic variables affect the crops yields, which is how climate change influences household wellbeing. Agricultural yields can also be predicted under different scenarios of CC, using the predicted climate for different ESMs and GHG emission growth scenarios. 
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the percentage changes of agricultural yields under different future emission scenarios. It is shown, in column 5, that the yield index increases, on average, 1.6% for the RCP 4.5 scenario of moderate GHG emission growth (0.1% inter model mean, with a 4.5% standard deviation). However, these modest averages hide a pronounced heterogeneity, by geographic region the yields per hectare changes between -20% and 24.7%, the southern mountain and the southern coast being the geographic regions most affected. Additionally, it is possible to observe that the changes are sensitive to the intensity of CC, for example, the impact changes from positive to negative in all of the mountain regions (column 6 and 8).
