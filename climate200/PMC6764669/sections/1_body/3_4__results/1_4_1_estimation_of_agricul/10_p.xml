<p>The dependent variable 
 <italic>Y</italic> provides the crop yields per hectare. When analyzing agricultural productivity, we face the challenge of appropriately aggregating in an index the hundreds of crops that exist in a country with the agro-climatic diversity of Peru. On the other hand, it is necessary to consider that the choice of each crop is endogenous, which is to stay, determined in the biophysical context, of prices and preferences, which implies that to analyze each crop separately could distort the results of the impact of CC as the farmer optimizes the input assignments in an optimum mix of distinct crops. We offer a solution to these problems through the construction of a Törnqvist [
 <xref rid="pone.0222483.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] production quantity index. This index was chosen (and others rejected) as in its construction it considers each crop according to the product’s share in the total value of production of a representative producer (we use the average of the quantities between producers as the representative producer), but also considering the share of the same crop in the total production of each farmer. Thus, a better index is constructed in contexts such as the case of a particular crop that could be the only source of income for a particular farmer, but irrelevant on the national scale. The index is also comparable between years as prices were deflated, and the representative farmer is calculated between farmers and years that the study covers.
