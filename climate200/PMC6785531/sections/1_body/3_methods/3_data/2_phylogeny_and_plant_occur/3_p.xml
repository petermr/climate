<p id="Par32">We then filtered out occurrences of species that are not native to island polygons using the eMonocot database which provides information on a species’ “native” or “non-native” status. To do so, we attributed a Taxonomic Databases Working Group polygon (TDWG; scale used in the eMonocot database
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>) to each island polygon used in our analysis
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. All GBIF occurrences associated with a TDWG polygon and corresponding to a non-native species in the eMonocot database were excluded, which could sometimes lead to the exclusion of a genus.
