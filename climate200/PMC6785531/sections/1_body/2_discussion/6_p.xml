<p id="Par17">In the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), PD is now recognised as a key indicator of one of “Nature’s Contributions to People” (NCP 18 - maintenance of options)

 </sup>. Indeed, PD provides options for future generations and for organisms to adapt in a changing environment

 </sup>. The IPBES therefore highlighted that the loss of phylogenetic diversity implies irreversible losses of options to humanity
