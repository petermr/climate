<p id="Par42">We estimated the vulnerability of each island to each threat, i.e. sea level rise, shift in temperature and shift in rainfall. For each factor associated with a particular threat related to climate change, islands were ranked according to the expected influence of that factor on island vulnerability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). We then attributed a score between 1 (low rank) to 5 (high rank) to each island depending on its position in the ranking. For each threat, each island was given 4 or 5 scores (for shifts in temperature/rainfall and sea level rise respectively) (see above; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The vulnerability of an island to a threat is quantified as the mean of these scores.
