<p id="Par8">By removing the effect of richness on the ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> using null models (see methods), we found that the most significant losses were predominantly expected at low latitudes and eastern longitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Islands with highly significant ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> were, among others: Madagascar, Borneo, New-Guinea, Tasmania, Sri Lanka, but also Cuba and Tierra del Fuego. For insular endemic genera, significant ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was found, among others, for Madagascar, Indonesia (Sumatra, Borneo, New Guinea, Sulawesi), the West Indies (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola), Honshu, Sri Lanka, and Tasmania (Fig.
