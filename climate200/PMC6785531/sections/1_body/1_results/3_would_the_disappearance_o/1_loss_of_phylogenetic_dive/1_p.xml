<p id="Par9">We found that, on average, the ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> for each category of vulnerability was very similar across the four types of threats (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, the highest values of ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> were found for islands with moderate vulnerability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Notable exceptions include Cuba and New Guinea, which were highly vulnerable to predicted sea level rise and shifts in rainfall, respectively, and whose disappearance would cause large ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic>. Significant ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic>, i.e. higher than expected by chance (p_value
 <sub>ind</sub>), was found for only a small proportion of islands among all categories of vulnerabilities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For shifts in temperature and sea level rise, the median p-value
 <sub>ind</sub> was highest in the “very high vulnerability” category (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). When considering only endemic genera, the highest ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was predicted to occur mainly for islands in the “moderately vulnerable” category (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, only a small proportion of islands had significant ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and they generally had a low or moderate vulnerability to climate change (e.g. Madagascar, large Indonesian islands).
