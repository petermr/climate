<p id="Par48">The third step of the analysis was to link island vulnerability (step 1) to the expected loss of PD (step 2). We first estimated the 
 <italic>absolute</italic> ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> per island per category of vulnerability. Due to the high number of vulnerability scores we defined 4 categories of vulnerability: low (1 ≤ vulnerability score &lt; 2), moderate (2 ≤ vulnerability score &lt; 3), high (3 ≤ vulnerability score &lt; 4) and very high vulnerability (4 ≤ vulnerability score ≤ 5). From this we identified the islands and the categories of vulnerability where ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> would be the highest.
