<p id="Par49">Second, we linked the 
 <italic>significance</italic> of ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> when islands were lost independently to the category of vulnerability they belonged to. We calculated the distribution of p-values
 <sub>ind</sub> (i.e. the departure from the null model described above) and the median p-value
 <sub>ind</sub> per vulnerability category. We identified in this way the categories where significant ExpPD
 <italic>loss</italic> was most frequent.
