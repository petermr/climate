<p id="Par2">It is now widely accepted by the scientific community that the Earth is undergoing drastic climate change due to increased greenhouse gas emissions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Changes in global climate have occurred several times throughout the Earth’s history but have stretched over very long periods of time whereas currently these changes are taking place over the space of a century or less
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. This rapid change, associated with other threats resulting from human activity related to production and consumption
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>, are having a strong impact on biodiversity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, climate change may lead to direct alterations of natural habitats, forcing species to move from their historical range, adapt to new environmental conditions, find refuge in unaltered microhabitats or may lead to species extinction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Importantly, climate change acts in synergy with other human-induced threats, such as land use intensification or biological invasion, increasing their effects.
