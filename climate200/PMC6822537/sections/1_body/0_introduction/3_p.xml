<p>Temperature affects the chemical and physical properties of animals and their environment, such as the rates of biochemical reactions within an animal and the density of fluids an animal moves through. Standard performance curves can be used to describe the change in performance with temperature, indicating the maximal performance, the optimal temperature for maximal performance (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>opt</sub>), and the performance breadth, which is the range of temperature over which a specified level of performance can be attained (

 <sub>opt</sub> of a specific enzyme between species or populations (
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Hochachka and Somero, 2002</xref>). Such enzymes exhibit relatively rapid declines in performance at higher than optimal temperature with inactivation and eventual denaturation occurring. Therefore, both increases and decreases in environmental temperature due to climate change could result in reductions in performance.
