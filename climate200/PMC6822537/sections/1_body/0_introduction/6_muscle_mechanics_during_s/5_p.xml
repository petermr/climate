<p>Work loop experiments were developed to allow closer 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> simulation of the type of muscle actions that occur 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> during power-producing activities (

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Caiozzo, 2002</xref>). The force generated by the muscle is plotted against the length change to produce a work loop, the area of which represents the work done during a length change cycle (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The power generated by the muscle can be determined as the sum of work done divided by the time taken to do that work. As temperature rises up to normal body temperature, there is an increase in work loop power output, in muscle isolated from amphibians, fish, mammals, and reptiles (

 </xref>). As temperature rises, work loop power output can be enhanced by a combination of increasing the maximal shortening velocity of the muscle such that maximal power output is achieved at a higher cycle frequency and by increasing the area of the work loop via the following: (i) reducing the time taken to generate force and to relax; (ii) enhancing the muscle's ability to produce force while shortening; and (iii) a reduction in the passive resistance to lengthening (

 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">James, 2013</xref>). Thermal sensitivity of muscle power output varies between species with, in general, higher thermal sensitivity in skeletal muscle from endotherms. Importantly, power output determined by work loops also indicates that increased temperature above, or below, that normally experienced can result in a decrease in power output, such that the optimal temperature for skeletal muscle power output generally seems to be about the normal active body temperature.
