<p>These studies on hibernation reinforce the findings on aestivation to demonstrate that some species are able to spend substantial periods of time in a dormant state to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions without appreciable effects on subsequent mechanical performance of skeletal muscle, which is particularly important as post-dormancy such species tend to focus on fitness-related behaviours, such as finding and securing a mate. It is possible that further climate change could extend the periods of dormancy required. However, the possible duration of dormancy is limited, not least by the supply of stored energy required to maintain survival (
