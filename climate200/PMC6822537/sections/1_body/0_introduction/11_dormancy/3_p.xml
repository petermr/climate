<p>While climate change is more likely to cause regions to be on average warmer than colder, extreme weather events are likely to be more common and some of the overall findings from studies on hibernation may provide useful insight into dormancy in general. Up to 4 months of hibernation, while submerged in water, in the common frog, 
 <italic>Rana temporaria</italic>, had no effect on maximal isometric force, force–velocity relationships from isovelocity experiments, or work loop power output in sartorius muscle (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>). In the 13-lined ground squirrel, 
 <italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>, 3 months of hibernation did not cause a change in the maximal power output of soleus muscle (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Previous studies on ground squirrels have indicated little or no change in skeletal muscle fibre type but a decrease in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration rates, which would help explain the mechanical properties observed (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Many other hibernating mammals, such as bears, bats, and various rodents, undergo limited muscle atrophy, with no change in muscle fibre type or small shifts toward more oxidative fibres and little or no changes in the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle (
