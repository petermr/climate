<p>Further work needs to be done to better simulate the effects of prolonged locomotor activity in isolated muscle preparations to clarify the effects of temperature on sustained mechanical performance of skeletal muscle. As most previous studies have focused on thermal effects on one level of organization in a species removed from its environment, it is difficult to fully comprehend how important the broader effects of climate change on muscle mechanics will be in influencing local extinction rates of species. Therefore, additional work is needed to better understand the effects of temperature-induced changes on the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle on fitness-related whole animal performance, behaviour, and in turn the ability of a species to maintain its geographical range. Further work is also needed to investigate whether different climate changeâ€“related variables interact in their effects on skeletal muscle and whole animal performance, e.g. changes in ocean pH, habitat fragmentation, dehydration (more likely during periods of drought), and effects of pollutants (such as plastics, etc).</p>
