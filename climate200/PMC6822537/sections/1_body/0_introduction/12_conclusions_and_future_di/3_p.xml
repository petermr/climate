<p>While many journal papers considering effects of temperature on skeletal muscle and locomotor performance set such studies against a background of climate change, there are not enough data to indicate whether increases or decreases in environmental temperature, of the magnitude likely in climate change scenarios, will cause meaningful effects on skeletal muscle mechanics, locomotor performance, and behaviour in the species studied as few studies have estimated the likely remaining capacity of a population to buffer against such changes. Responses of a species to climate change would ideally also need to be considered in terms of their wider ecosystem to account for climate change effects on such aspects as predator–prey interactions (
