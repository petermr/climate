<p>While the published literature is relatively sparse, it seems likely that colder or hotter environments will affect the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle and could in turn influence aspects of animal performance and behaviour, but further work is needed to better elucidate such relationships. What is clear is that some species are able to respond to changes in environmental temperature by undergoing acclimation of physiological processes or spending time in a ‘dormant’ state.</p>
