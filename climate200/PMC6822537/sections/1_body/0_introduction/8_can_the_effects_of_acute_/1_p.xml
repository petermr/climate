<p>A key question as to whether changes in skeletal muscle performance are important to survival of individuals or species is whether there is a direct link between variation in the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle, changes in locomotor performance, and subsequent alterations in behaviour. Modelling conducted by 
 <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Seebacher 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2015
 </xref>) demonstrated that individual variation in the mechanical performance of isolated skeletal muscle could partially explain observed differences in the overall swimming performance between those individual zebrafish, which in turn explained the time a fish was active in a novel environment and in turn an individual’s boldness in approaching a novel object. Thus, simplistically, longer, lower-weight fishes that had muscle that produced higher force at a quicker rate were more likely to have higher sustained and sprint swimming performance, such that they were more likely to spend more time active and to cover a greater distance in the behavioural test in the novel environment and were in turn more likely to show higher boldness in approaching a novel object (
 <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">Seebacher 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). These findings suggest that variation in the mechanical performance of skeletal muscle can explain differences observed between individuals in locomotor performance and, in turn, behaviour. Thus, could effects of temperature on muscle mechanics and locomotion alter behaviour?
