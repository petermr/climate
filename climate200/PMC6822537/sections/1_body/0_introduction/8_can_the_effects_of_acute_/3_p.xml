  <italic>et al.</italic> (2018
 </xref>) demonstrated that behaviour of individuals of delicate skink, 
 <italic>Lampropholis delicate</italic>, was linked to thermal sensitivity of performance such that a distinct ‘hot’ group of individuals had higher preferred body temperature, lower breadth of selected body temperature, higher optimal performance temperature, and lower thermal performance breadth than the ‘cold’ group; the hot group, when at a common temperature, spent more time active, spent more time exploring and less time hiding when in a novel environment, and had faster maximal sprint speeds than the cold group. These findings suggest that thermal physiology can constrain behaviour in predictable ways, affecting the way that individuals use niches within a habitat.
