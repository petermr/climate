<p>Usually, acclimation occurs when the seasonal change in temperature is predictable and large when compared to daily variation in temperature. In contrast, species that live in environments with relatively high daily variation in temperature may have lower thermal sensitivity enabling them to perform reasonably well over a comparatively broad range of temperatures (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). For example, amphibian tadpoles, which often live in relatively small volumes of water that can be subjected to high daily thermal variability, on the whole seem unable to acclimate, instead having comparably low thermal sensitivity such that locomotor performance is near maximal across a broad range of temperatures (

 <italic>Limnodynastes peronei</italic>, when acclimated to 10°C achieved about 50% greater maximum swimming velocity and acceleration, at a relatively low temperature of 10°C, in comparison to those acclimated to 24°C. When acclimation period at 10°C was increased from 6 weeks to 8 months, there was also a marked reduction in swimming performance at 24°C (

 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Niehaus 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2011
 </xref>) tested whether daily thermal variation around a mean acclimation temperature caused differences in thermal sensitivity of performance in striped marsh frog. They found that swimming performance and skeletal muscle lactate dehydrogenase (a marker enzyme for anaerobic metabolic capacity in skeletal muscle) activity showed the same thermal sensitivity across a temperature range of 14–34°C regardless of the acclimation treatment, demonstrating that large daily thermal variation does not affect acclimation response in some species (
