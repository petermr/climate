<p>Some studies on thermal acclimation indicate that the capacity to acclimate to temperature change varies between species and can vary between populations within a species, possibly determined by the long-term variability in temperature that a population or species is subjected to (

Species with the capacity to acclimate in response to temperature change have, in some studies, been shown to alter the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle via mechanisms, such as changes in myofibrillar ATPase activity, differential expression of contractile protein isoforms, or changes in calcium handling (

Such species that are able to acclimate may be better equipped to deal with, at least, small long-term changes in environmental temperature that can occur as a result of climate change. However, it is unclear whether these species can deal well with an overall more variable climate, particularly as such variability could mask the cue to acclimate.
