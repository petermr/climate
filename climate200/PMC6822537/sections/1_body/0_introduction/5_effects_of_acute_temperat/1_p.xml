<p>Changes in temperature can have profound effects on skeletal muscle mechanics. Studies, using skeletal muscle isolated from vertebrates, have generally demonstrated that up to an optimal, often relatively high, temperature, increased temperature causes greater force production, faster rates of force generation and relaxation, higher shortening speed, and enhanced power output (
