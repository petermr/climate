<p>Many previous studies focusing on the effects of global climate change on animals have considered the effects of altered temperature. Such studies have demonstrated that changes in temperature have been linked with shifts in geographical range of species, effectively causing local extinctions. For example, the movement of most species of fish in the North Sea to more Northern and/or deeper, therefore colder waters (

 </xref>). Some modelling studies have considered that rising temperatures could restrict the amount of time that individual animals can be active in their environment, thereby reducing the time available to partake in fitness-related behaviours (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). However, more attention needs to be given to the effects of temperature on the actual performance of animals while they are active to improve modelling of the effects of climate change on animal species survival and distribution.
