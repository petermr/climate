<p>As environmental temperature alters over time, individuals may be able to continue to be active and survive at that temperature, if their thermal sensitivity is sufficiently low, or may undertake a physiological response, such as acclimation or dormancy, or may be forced to move to an environment with a more favourable temperature.</p>
