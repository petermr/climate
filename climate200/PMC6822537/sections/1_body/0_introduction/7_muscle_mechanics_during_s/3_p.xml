<p>Ambiguity in findings make it difficult to make comparisons between studies, and such disparity is likely to arise, at least in part, from methodological discrepancies, including whether the test temperature was close to normal body temperature, relevance of the fatigue protocol with respect to real-world function, and the complexity around aetiology of fatigue. As an example, previous work defines fatigue by an arbitrary decline in performance relative to a pre-fatigue maximal (

 </xref>) or over an arbitrary number of predefined activations (ranging from 10 to 105 activations) (

 </xref>) and is either measured during maximal or sub-maximal activation, force, or power-generating conditions. Fatigue occurs as a two-phase decline, whereby the initial rapid decline in muscle function may take longer and be attenuated at higher temperatures, but an increased temperature may cause performance to decline more rapidly in the latter phase where the loss of force occurs more slowly (

 </xref>,

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). These distinct phases are not always considered in previous work and may be apparent without a temperature-induced change in the end point of fatigue (
