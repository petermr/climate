<p>While other mechanical variables show a typical trend of a temperature-induced improvement in performance, this is not consistently shown in the literature considering sustained muscle activity. Work by 
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">James 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2012
 </xref>) reported that the endurance of iliotibialis muscle isolated from 
 <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, measured via a change in maximal work loop power over a protocol of repeated activations, increased with temperature (
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). A temperature-induced improvement in fatigue resistance has been reported in previous work using both protocols of repeated isometric tetani and cycles of active shortening (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). Conversely, there is conflicting evidence that increased temperature has limited effects on fatigue resistance (
