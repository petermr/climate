<abstract abstract-type="teaser">
 <p>Changes in temperature, caused by climate change, can alter the amount of power an animal’s muscle produces, which could in turn affect that animal’s ability to catch prey or escape predators. Some animals may cope with such changes, but other species could undergo local extinction as a result.</p>
