 <caption> Effect of temperature on the maximal isometric stress (force normalized to muscle cross-sectional area) generated by isolated mouse diaphragm muscle. Each data point represents the maximum stress generated by one muscle at that temperature. Eight muscles were subjected to four different temperatures each. Temperature was randomized for each muscle. Based on data presented in James etÂ al. (2015 ). </caption>
