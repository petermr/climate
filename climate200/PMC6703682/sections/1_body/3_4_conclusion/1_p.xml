<p>Our results can inform policymaking, as they shed light on the effect of climate change while incorporating endogenous adaptation of actors. Seemingly beneficial climate impacts, such as a cost reduction due to climate-induced movement of fish stock, may turn out negative, as they increase the propensity to over-fish. When policymakers consider climate change impacts on their fishing sectors, they should not stop at an analysis of catch potential. Even if a fishery currently makes a considerable food and income security contribution under open access and the catch potential would not decrease, climate change might alter the open-access equilibrium to the point where the species is pushed toward extinction. In other words, climate change may alter the need for resource management in a fishery. For the fishery in question, it is clear that without intervention, sustainable resource use is not likely. Moreover, our findings reveal large uncertainty of outcomes with respect to different climate projections, even when qualitative patterns of the climate trajectories are preserved and the differences seem small in the original climate data. Thus, the results underline the need for careful comparative evaluations with different climate projections, and can help policymakers to be on the look-out for important projection traits that may explain outcome differences.</p>
