<p>To grasp the severity of climate change impacts fully, it is important to consider complementary future changes, such as those in market development and technological progress. Future market, technology, and factor price development are part of our analysis. Our results show that on aggregate, they accelerate the unsustainable use of the resource. The counteracting increase in fuel prices due to the increase in world market oil prices is not sufficient to turn the tide. Thus, if economic development is neglected in climate change simulation studies, impacts may be underestimated.</p>
