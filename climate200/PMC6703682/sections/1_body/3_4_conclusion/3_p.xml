<p>We show that abolishing fuel subsidies leads to more sustainable use of the resource. In monetary terms, this is beneficial for the sector as a whole, but also for each of the two factions—consumers and fishers—separately. We conclude that this policy should be considered to enhance overall welfare and to help the sector adapt to climate change. However, this policy alone is not sufficient. It can buy time to implement a proper resource management, such as quotas or—if these are not feasible—more refined effort restrictions. If such a system were successfully implemented, the gains could be large; climate change reduces harvesting costs for a considerable time period. Biomass growth is either unaffected or increases, depending on the climate projection. If over-fishing could be eliminated, the sector would yield a contribution to income and food security that could exceed even current yields. Necessary avenues of future research include the extension of the model to linkages with stocks and fisheries in neighboring Mauritania, as well the inclusion of further fleets and species interactions, once data becomes available. Furthermore, tipping points may play a role: For example, if SST finally becomes too high in nursery areas that can not be compensated by an earlier start of the nursing season, this may threaten larval survival and lead to extinction of the sub-population within a few short years. Further experimental research on such tipping points could shed light on the likelihood of such disastrous events.</p>
