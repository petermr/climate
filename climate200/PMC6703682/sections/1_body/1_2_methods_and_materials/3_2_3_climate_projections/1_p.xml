 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. For example, while there is general support among climate models for a continuation in the rise of SST throughout the 21st century, the extent of this rise varies among them [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. To consider this model uncertainty, we use the output of two different earth system models with two different formulations per model, to investigate the consequences of the model spread for artisanal fisheries. This comparison allows us to analyze the importance of certain traits and differences for the fishery. The use and comparison of different climate models can improve the overall understanding of climate impacts and the variability of outcomes, as weaknesses are partly compensated for and greater reliability is achieved [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The two other projections (NESM-o and NESM-bc) are based on the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), as described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. ECE-o and NESM-o are the original model versions, whereas ECE-bc and NESM-bc are bias corrected. For ECE-bc, bias correction is achieved through adaptation of the ocean-mixing parameter in the ocean model part. For NESM-bc, bias correction is applied by replacing SST from the ocean model part with anomalies before running the atmospheric model, and vice versa with wind stress. The estimated bias is projected into the future. All models use the representative concentration pathway 8.5 as a basis for radiative forcing, that is, business-as-usual continued forcing.
