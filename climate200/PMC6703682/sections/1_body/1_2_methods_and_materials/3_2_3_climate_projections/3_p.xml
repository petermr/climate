<p>In Section H of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</xref>, we compare the four projections concerning mean, trend, standard deviation, and cyclical behavior of key impacts. On average, both winter and fall upwelling show a slight decrease over time for all four models, and are predicted to be stronger under NESM-o and NESM-bc than under ECE-o and ECE-bc. All mean values for winter upwelling for the period 2014–2079 lie below the average observed value during the estimation period (2001–2013). The upper level of the 95% confidence interval falls below the maximum observed value. For fall upwelling, only NESM-o and NESM-bc averages lie above the estimation period mean. For these two, the 95% confidence interval falls fully within the span of observed values. ECE-o and ECE-bc show substantial variability in inter-annual upwelling.
