<p>To evaluate policy alternatives, we consider two scenarios. The development of the mean annual fuel price over time for each of the scenarios is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The first is the business-as-usual case (BAU). A proportionate subsidy of 30.7% [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] in the form of tax exemptions has formed the most important component of subsidies [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] since the 1960s. The second scenario considers the case in which the tax-exemption is linearly decreased over 15 years until subsidies are fully eliminated (“melt-down,” md), which enables a gradual transition for fishers and consumers. The price plateaus in 2034, but its level is about 600 FCFA higher under the reform scenario than under the BAU scenario.
