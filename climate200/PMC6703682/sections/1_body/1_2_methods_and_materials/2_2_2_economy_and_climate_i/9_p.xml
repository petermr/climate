<p>Climate enters the economic model in two ways: It affects the growth of the stock and changes the amount of fish that can be harvested sustainably. Higher stock levels decrease harvesting costs. Second, SST has a non-linear, convex impact on harvesting costs, as it affects the spatial distribution of the stock. Thus, an increase in SST can increase the propensity to over-fish.</p>
