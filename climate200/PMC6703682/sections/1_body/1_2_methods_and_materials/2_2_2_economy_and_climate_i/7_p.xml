<p>According to the model assumptions, fishers minimize costs subject to the prices for capital, labor, and fuel. Capital and labor are supplied on local markets and are not flexibly adaptable following Quaas et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Hence, we assume increasing and convex iso-elastic inverse supply functions: in equilibrium, wages and the cost of capital increase with the amount of capital and labor used by the fishery. In previous climate change adaptation studies on agriculture, access to financing has been found to be a major determinant [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Fuel supply is perfectly elastic, and prices are determined on the world market. We specify the resulting equilibrium cost function as quadratic, following [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] (see Section G of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</xref> for robustness). Fuel prices already explain a large part of the strong cost trend found in the previous literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A linear cost time trend is added to include remaining unobserved trends in factor prices and the size of factor units. The trend parameter is estimated to be positive at the 1% level. Net linear time trends in total, ceteris paribus, lead to a monthly increase in fishing pressure of 0.8â€“1.0%; however, this result is pitted against rising fuel prices, market development, and changing climate conditions. With continued market development, equilibrium harvest becomes more sensitive to input changes, particularly biomass. As consumers become less dependent on fish supply, prices remain stable across large ranges of biomass. The cost-reduction effect of larger biomass becomes more important in relative terms. For the subsequent simulation, we need to model how population density as well as fuel prices develop in the future. Data on population density as described earlier in this section and data on Brent oil prices, available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], are used to estimate linear trends into the future. Thereafter, the trend parameters are assumed to decline linearly over a period of 20 years, as is standard for economic models, such as DICE [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. For population density, we observe lower growth rates for more dense regions, in line with decreasing UN population projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. We also observe a lower productivity trend rate for the longer time horizon (see Section G of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</xref>) and a decreasing trend in energy prices worldwide.
