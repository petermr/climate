<p>We infer the following results from the estimation. The output elasticity of the capitalâ€“labor composite is 0.815 (significant at 1%). The resulting output elasticity of 0.185 for fuel means that fuel expenses constitute 18.5% of total fishing costs. Harvest production also depends on biomass at an estimated elasticity of 0.222 (significant at the 1%-level): harvest increases biomass, but the elasticity is rather small, as should be expected for a schooling fishery. Fish are located more easily at a larger biomass, but as fish form schools, this effect is comparatively weak; once a school is located, a large catch can be made without searching further. We estimate there is a positive linear time trend on catchability at a monthly rate of 0.9% (significant at the 1%-level), which we interpret to reflect technical progress. Furthermore, we estimate monthly dummies and find that catch productivity is highest in spring and winter, and lowest in late summer. Monthly dummies are all significant at least at the 10% level.</p>
