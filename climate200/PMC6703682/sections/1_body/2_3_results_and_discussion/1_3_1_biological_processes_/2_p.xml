<p>SST and monthly dummies enter the harvest function in a jointly multiplicative term. Hence, the SST effect on harvest pressure is strongest during the high season between February and May. These months, especially April and May, have particularly high catchability, also due to biological processes uncontrolled by SST. Section I of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220433.s001">S1 File</xref> provides a figure showing the development of harvest pressure over time for 4 exemplary months. During the high season, the fishery becomes cheaper over time, as the SST approaches the optimum temperature. The fish remain in the close-to-shore area for a longer period than before, where they are easily caught. Between June and December, the temperature increase leads to a decrease in catchability from 2040 onwards under all climate projections. Fish leave the close-to shore area slightly earlier than before. However, these months are generally less important for the fishery anyway. For both periods, the impact is stronger for ECE-o and ECE-bc, as is the variability. Overall, we observe a severe increase in catchability induced by the SST trend. Toward the end of the time horizon, this trend is either approximately stable (ECE-bc, NESM-o, and NESM-bc) or reversed (ECE-o), when SST already lies above the optimum point during spring. Then, the Senegalese waters finally become too warm for the species, which would permanently relocate northwards. These results are summarized as follows.
