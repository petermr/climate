<p>The main effect of climate change concerns the spatial stock distribution: biomass becomes more vulnerable to Senegalese purse seines over a certain time horizon, because the fish spend more time in the close-to-shore area. Abolishing fuel subsidies could buy time to bridge this transition period. The effectiveness of this measure depends on the climate development. It would be particularly effective under low variability and a weak SST trend, i.e. with a moderate extinction risk. If either variability or the SST trend proved too strong, this measure would be insufficient. A proper resource management system that goes beyond the mere abolition of subsidies, such as a binding limit on annual harvest, would be needed to ensure sustainability in the long term. Nonetheless, there is good news: productivity remains high under all projections except NESM-bc, such that rents and yields remain high if a proper management is installed. However, if the spatial stock redistribution effect crosses national boundaries, such a management would require multinational cooperation.</p>
