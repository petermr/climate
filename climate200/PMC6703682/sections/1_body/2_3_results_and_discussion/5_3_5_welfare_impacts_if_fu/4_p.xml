<p>We quantify this effect to analyze intervention effectiveness. The beneficial effect of removing fuel subsidies is not equally large across climate projections: The rent difference between policy scenarios varies between 33 billion and 62 billion FCFA, that is, 12â€“21% of the BAU rent value. Intervention effectiveness depends not only on the cost share of fuel for fishers or the size of the intervention. More important is how climate influences the extinction risk. A low stock may result from a system with overall low productivity (e.g. NESM-bc), with SST-induced over-harvesting incentives or from variability, for example after a sequence of unfavorable upwelling years (e.g. ECE-o). If the stock is low, a small difference in catches due to abolished fuel subsidies can be decisive for whether the resource goes extinct or whether it continues to contribute to food security. The benefit of saving the resource from extinction is even larger if the period of unfavorable climate is only temporary and followed by a more favorable climate with a high equilibrium stock and large sustainable catch potential.</p>
