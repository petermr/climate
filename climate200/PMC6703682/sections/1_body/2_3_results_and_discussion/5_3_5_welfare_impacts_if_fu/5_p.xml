<p>Gains due to increased survival time are positive for all scenarios, but largest under NESM-o. Under NESM-o, the abolition of fuel subsidies suffices for the resource to survive for a substantially longer amount of time. For NESM-bc and ECE-bc, policy gains are positive but small, because the intervention is not strong enough for the stock to survive the projected increase in harvest pressure. Under ECE-o, the mean survival year profile becomes more right skewed than in the case with fuel subsidies. This means that the intervention can help to decrease the extinction risk in late years, while it is not sufficient to save the resource in early years (keep in mind that the system is partly stochastic). Due to discounting, these long-run gains have a relatively low weight. Therefore, rent gains per additional survival year are low.</p>
