<p>The deterministic, average results are subject to additional pressure from climate variability. A particular consequence of variability is greater propensity to collapse. More variable climate conditions, such as under ECE-o and ECE-bc, may lead more often to situations in which stock survival is threatened. This depends particularly on the bio-economic equilibrium biomass around which the actual stock fluctuates driven by the variable climate. If this equilibrium stock size is large, it works as a strong buffer against climatically unfavorable years.</p>
