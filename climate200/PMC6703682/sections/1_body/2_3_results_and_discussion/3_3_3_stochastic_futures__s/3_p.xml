 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows one scatter plot for eight different modelsâ€”the combination of four climate projections and two policy scenarios. The mean time of survival is indicated on the y-axis. To compare welfare across climate projections, we use the mean net present value (NPV), indicated on the x-axis. The welfare impact is discussed in the next subsection, 3.4.
