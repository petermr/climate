<p>We calculate an average FS of 8.77 billion FCFA in 2014 and an average CS of 5.47 billion FCFA. At a typical price of 1,145 FCFA for a 5-kg basket of local grains, this amounts to 946 baskets yearly for each of the roughly 8100 fishers involved, and 1.96 baskets per inhabitant of the coastal region studied (2.4 million, about 21% of the total Senegalese population). These baskets constitute an additional gain for the fishers (consumers) over the situation in which the resource would not be available to them and they would have to work in different sectors (consume different products). Using observed harvest and prices, we calculate a mean yearly total rent value of 14.97 billion FCFA for 2004â€“2013. This compares well with the summed benefits from 2014, namely, 14.24 billion FCFA. We conclude that our simulation produces plausible results.</p>
