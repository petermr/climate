<p>If fuel subsidies were (gradually) abolished, harvest pressure would be lower, such that a higher equilibrium biomass would result (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220433.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Unsustainable years occur less often, particularly under NESM-o. Ensuring survival under ECE-bc and NESM-bc would prove very difficult in the medium term, when productivity is still relatively low and harvest pressure high, and even under the melt-down scenario, numerous unsustainable years arise.
