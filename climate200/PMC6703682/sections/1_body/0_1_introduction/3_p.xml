<p>Both climate projections and economic changes are important for policymakers to consider. Therefore, this study aims to simulate the impact of climatic changes on an artisanal open-access fishery under endogenous economic adaptation and (exogenous) economic development. High uncertainty exists with respect to climate change projections, particularly those concerning the amplitude of climate change and the extent of climate variability. Hence, for a robust understanding of climate change adaptation, it is necessary to compare how a fishery develops under different projections and to explore which climate scenario traits are important determinants.</p>
