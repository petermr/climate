<p>Owing to the complexity and global nature of the research, studies rely on simplifying assumptions, such as constant per capita consumption and landings according to biological catch potential or economic growth [

In open-access artisanal fisheries, in which local market feedbacks are typically strong, such adaptation processes are important. For example, fishers may adapt by changing the used amounts of fuel, capital, and labor in fishing. As a result, over-fishing may increase or decrease with rising harvest potential. Non-linear changes in equilibrium harvest and fish prices arise. While this is scarcely analyzed in fisheries models [

 <xref rid="pone.0220433.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] explicitly modeled adaptation in a crop model, which turned negative impacts of climate change into positive crop yield gains. Apart from climate change, economic changes over time also shape future fish harvest and prices. Market development and urbanization change consumer dependence on fish [
