 <caption> Zonal dependence of the typical stretching rates. The ensemble mean 〈 h λ, s 〉 of the zonal-seasonal mean h λ, s of the stretching rate h for the PlaSim ( a, b) and for the CESM climate realizations ( c, d) in JJA ( a, c) and DJF ( b, d) for years 30–49 (in the shades of violet) and for years 50–150 (from blue to red) for PlaSim, and for years 1990–2005, 2026–2035 and 2071–2080 (from blue to red) for CESM realizations. Each line connects the mean of the different latitudes for a given year. The values of the years 30 to 49 (representing the stationary climate) in the panels a,b are shifted by +0.1 day −1 for clarity. </caption>
