<p id="Par7">The results based on the climate realizations of CESM are also analyzed in order to compare with the PlaSim outcomes. In this study 35 members of CESM–LE have been used. For these realizations the ensemble mean of the global mean surface temperature from 1990 to 2080 increases by about 3.5 °C. For the transport simulations the velocity fields of the years 1990–2005, 2026–2035 and 2071–2080 are used in 6 h time resolution (required for the transport calculations). Since the vertical velocity is not available, 2D transport simulations are carried out.</p>
