<p id="Par21">To summarize, in this study we investigated the large-scale spreading in an ensemble approach. Our results reveal that in order to gain the typical features of spreading under different climate conditions, it is unavoidable to use the ensemble framework proposed here. For an improvement, higher resolution meteorological fields and ensembles of climate realizations of at least hundreds of members would be needed.</p>
