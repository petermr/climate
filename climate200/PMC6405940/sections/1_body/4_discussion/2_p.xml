<p id="Par20">The results obtained by using the meteorological fields of both models agree in the fact that the ensemble mean of the areal-seasonal mean of the stretching rate and that of the absolute value of the relative vorticity change in parallel, and there is a clear linear dependence between them with an average slope of [6–7] × 10

This relationship may help estimate the changes in the intensity of spreading for arbitrary ensembles utilizing only meteorological variables (i.e. relative vorticity or velocity data) operationally computed and stored by the climate models, without carrying out numerous computationally demanding dispersion simulations. It is interesting to note that a similar relation between some kind of stretching, i.e., the relative dispersion of particle pairs (the analogs of Lyapunov exponents in the language of dynamical system theory describing the local, short term stretching) and enstrophy was recognized even in the early 70’s
