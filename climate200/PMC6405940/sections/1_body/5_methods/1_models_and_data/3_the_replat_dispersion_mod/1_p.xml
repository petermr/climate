<p id="Par25">For the simulation of the spreading of the pollutants in the atmosphere the RePLaT model is used. RePLaT is a Lagrangian trajectory model that tracks individual spherical particles with fixed, realistic radius and density. The velocity of a particle is given by the Newtonian equation of motion of the particle, and in the vertical direction deposition is also taken into account. RePLaT can reckon with the effect of turbulent diffusion on the particles as a stochastic term in the equations of motion, and it can simulate the scavenging of particles by precipitation as a random process that results in a particle being captured by a raindrop with a probability depending on the precipitation intensity and the collision efficiency of raindrops and aerosol particles.</p>
