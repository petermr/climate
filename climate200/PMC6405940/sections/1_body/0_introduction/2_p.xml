<p id="Par3">In general, analyzing historical meteorological reanalysis data, time series analysis is the only tool available to identify trends and to determine correlation coefficients between variables. However, if one intends to perform predictions for the climate system characterized by complex (chaotic), non-stationary dynamics, it has been established that the only way to gain appropriate statistics is evaluating them over an ensemble of parallel climate realizations

 </sup>. As a consequence, it might be misleading to study one single time-series, therefore, even the analysis of large-scale spreading needs to be reconsidered. Recent studies, see e.g. ref.

 </sup>, reveal that the analysis of single time-series is not representative, they might exhibit properties being atypical in the whole ensemble. Furthermore, to be able to use any temporal averaging technique one needs stationarity, a condition that does not apply for a changing climate. Therefore, in this paper we turn to the use of ensembles in the sense of the so-called snapshot (or pullback) attractor approach
