<p id="Par15">The position of the 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> particles of a filament is determined by the local velocity of the atmospheric flow in the consecutive time instants. Therefore, the length of a filament (computed from the particle positions), and hence the stretching rate 
 <italic>h</italic> of a filament are Lagrangian quantities determined by the velocity values along the filament over the investigated time interval. However, if one intends to estimate the change in the intensity of large-scale spreading based on only the meteorological fields of a climate realization, without carrying out transport simulations and knowing the exact trajectories which the 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> particles would follow, only Eulerian characteristics from the gridded meteorological data can be calculated. Therefore, the relationship of an Eulerian quantity to the stretching rate is investigated in this study. (As an outlook, in the Supplementary information in Section 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> we also present a brief study in which the relationship of 
 <italic>h</italic> to a meteorological quantity calculated along the filaments is investigated). In a previous research
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, not using meteorological ensembles, the connection with numerous meteorological quantities was analyzed, and it was found that the correlation is the strongest between the stretching rate and the absolute value of the relative vorticity |
 <italic>ξ</italic>|. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the relationship of the stretching rate with only this quantity. Note that |
 <italic>ξ</italic>| is also a quantity directly linked to the velocity differences of the atmospheric flow that cause the stretching of the filaments. A further advantage of relative vorticity is that it is easy and clear to determine based on velocity fields operationally produced by the climate models.
