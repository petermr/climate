  <italic>λ</italic>,

The largest stretching rates appear in the respective winter season of the hemispheres, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. Based on these curves, the overall changes are much easier to describe: they show that during years 30–49 〈

 <sup>−1</sup> characterizes almost the whole globe in both seasons except a small band of width of 10° around the Southern Pole in JJA and a band with width of 40° at the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.
