<p id="Par10">In this study, the filaments are tracked for a 10-day-long time period, characteristic to continental and global transport processes. The stretching rate is determined by fitting a linear function to the time evolution of the natural logarithm of the length of a filament from day 3 to 10. (For the technical details, see section Methods). Filaments of initial length of 6° (for PlaSim) and 3° (for CESM–LE) are initialized in the free atmosphere at the level of 500 hPa, so that even the initial length of the line segments exceeds the grid size of the meteorological fields. In order to be able to study the geographical dependence of the stretching rate, in each simulation 12 × 17 filaments are initialized uniformly distributed over the globe from 150 °W to 180 °E and from 80 °S to 80 °N. These simulations are started in every 10 days for June–July–August (JJA) and December–January–February (DJF) for the years 30–150 for each of the 110 PlaSim climate realizations and for the years 1990–2005, 2026–2035 and 2071–2080 for each of the 35 CESM realizations.</p>
