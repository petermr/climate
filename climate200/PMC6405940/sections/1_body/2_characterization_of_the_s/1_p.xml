<p id="Par9">To characterize the intensity of pollutant spreading, the so-called stretching rate is used. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates exemplary “pollutant clouds” (ensembles of 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> particles) initiated as 1-D filaments distributed along a meridian in a single climate realization. It shows that pollutant clouds typically spread in a more and more stretched, filamentary structure in the atmosphere. After a few days, the length 
 <italic>L</italic> of a filament can be approximated by an exponential function over time 
 <italic>t</italic>, that is, 
 <italic>L</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>)~exp(
 <italic>ht</italic>), where the exponent 
 <italic>h</italic> is called the stretching rate. It corresponds to the topological entropy in dynamical systems theory

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. This quantity is a measure of the chaoticity, and, therefore, is closely related to the unpredictability of the spreading and the complexity of the structure of a pollutant cloud. In general, the larger the topological entropy, the faster a pollutant cloud grows and the more foldings and meanders it displays. For more details on the topological entropy, see refs
