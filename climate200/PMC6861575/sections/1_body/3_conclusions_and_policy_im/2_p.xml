<p id="p0120">The impact of climate change on agriculture is evident and well documented. Farmers over the years have resorted to the adoption of adaptation strategies that could either reduce or spread the risks from climate change. Thus, research on climate adaptation mechanisms among gender groups remain worth undertaking, especially, at the micro (local) level. This study analyzed the adoption of climate adaptation strategies by farmers in Ghana, considering one district each from the southern and northern parts of the country. Also, this study moves the frontier of gender climate adaptation analysis by defining four gender groups other than the binary definition (i.e. male and female) assumed by most previous studies. The study established that female heads reported significant severer impacts of climate change on their farms than the other gender groups. Also, from the farmersâ€™ own assessment of their climate adaptation levels, it is concluded that the males, particularly, the male household members followed by male heads had higher climate adaptation levels than the other gender groups. This is confirmed by the adoption intensity by the farmers which showed that more male members than the other gender groups adopted more than half of the total number of adaptation strategies considered in this study.</p>
