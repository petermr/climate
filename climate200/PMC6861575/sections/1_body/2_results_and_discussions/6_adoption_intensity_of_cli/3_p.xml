 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the percentage of farmers who adopted a combination of specific number of adaptation strategies. This is to show within a gender perspective, whether or not few farmers adopted a combination of a small number of adaptation strategies or vice versa. In terms of the pattern of the adoption intensity of male heads, the minimum adoption intensity was 4 and the maximum intensity was 20. The percentage of adoption intensity for the male heads increased from 4 to 7 strategies, declined at 8 strategies and again peaked at 11 strategies. For male household members, the minimum number of strategies adopted was 6 strategies. The percentage of adoption intensity was highest at 7 and 12 strategies. For female heads, the minimum adoption intensity was 5 and the maximum adoption intensity was 18 strategies. About 23.5% of the female heads simultanously adopted 7 strategies. The percentage of female members by adoption intensity shows an increasing percentage that peaked at 7 strategies, declined at 10 strategies and again peaked at 11 strategies. Only 1.1% of the female household members adopted all 20 strategies simultaneously. The implication is that the adoption intensity is highest for male members than the other gender groups. Specifically, 67.9% of male members adopted 10–20 strategies simultaneously while 55.3% male heads adopted 10–20 strategies. For females, the percentage that adopted 10–20 strategies was less than 50%; 47.7% for female members and 20.6% for female household heads. Empirically, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Assan et al. (2018)</xref> observed that while 75% of female household heads adopted strategies to curtail climatic shocks, as high as 95% of male household heads adopted strategies in response to climatic shocks, and this supports the findings of this study.
