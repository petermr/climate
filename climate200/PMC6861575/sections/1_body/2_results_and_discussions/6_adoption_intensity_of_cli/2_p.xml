 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the adoption level of each adaptation strategy was presented. The findings show that the adoption of the strategies is not mutually exclusive. Therefore, there is the need to understand the adoption intensity of climate adaptation strategies within the various gender groups. The analysis of the data revealed a mean climate adaption of 10.3 for male heads, 12.5 for male household members, 8.6 for female heads and 10.0 for female household members. A test of significant difference of the mean adoption intensities revealed an 
 <italic>F</italic>-value of 4.96 and a 
 <italic>P</italic>-Value of 0.0023. This implies that there is a statistically significant difference in the adoption intensity among gender groups. Thus, the males have a significantly higher adaptive potentials than the female farmers. This is consistent with 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Solomon and Edet (2018)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Deressa et al. (2009)</xref> who found that male farmers had higher probabilities of adopting climate adaptation strategies than their female counterparts. 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ngigi et al. (2017)</xref> argued that the adoption of climate adaptation strategies by gender is interplayed with responsibilities, social norms and access to resources.
