For the result, 54% of males and 59.4% of females engaged in zero tillage while 69% and 70% respectively of male and female farmers engaged in intercropping. These findings are not surprising since female farmers either do not have access to tractors for ploughing large farm lands and also engage in the production of crops that necessarily meet household food needs of the farmers. Therefore, these could not be voluntary adaptation by the female farmers but due to socioeconomic conditions. Related to this study,
