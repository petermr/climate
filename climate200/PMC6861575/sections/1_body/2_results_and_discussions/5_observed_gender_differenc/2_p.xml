The identified strategies were provided to the farmers to indicate which of them they adopted and have been practicing up till the 2018 production season. The results in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> show the various climate adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers within a gender perspective. These strategies involved various on-farm strategies that farmers use in crop production and had practiced in the 2018 cropping season. A total of 20 strategies were identified and presented to the farmers to indicate their adoption of each strategy. The ANOVA test results show that there are statistically significant differences in the adoption levels of crop rotation, land rotation, repeated sowing, tractor ploughing, animal ploughing, cover cropping, mulching, bunding and organic farming between the gender groups.
