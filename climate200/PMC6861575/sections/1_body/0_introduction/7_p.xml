<p id="p0035">However, the significant roles of women in climate adaptation cannot be underrated. This is particularly due to the fact that women are important agents of change. Empirical studies such as 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Sundstr√∂m and Mccright (2014)</xref> observed that women are more concerned with the environment than men. This implies that the quality of the environment is more a priority to women than men, an indication that women may adopt more mitigation strategies than adaptation strategies. However, considering the localized effects of climate adaptation compared with mitigation, there is the need to improve climate adaptation of females, especially in agrarian settings such as Ghana. The first step to this objective is to identify the existing gender differences in climate adaptation in order to identify specific areas that need to be given more priority. Therefore, this study analyzed the gender perspectives of climate adaptation in Ghana. This study is different from previous studies that considered gender and climate adaptation because the former defined gender within a binary (e.g. male heads vs female heads) framework and this has led to nuance results. For instance, the vulnerability of a female household head who controls the resources of the family may be less than the vulnerability of a male household member whose use of family resources is subject to the decision of the household head. Similarly, defining gender as male and female assumes that the male farmers, irrespective of their access to resources such as finance and information on new technologies, have high adaptive capacity to climate change than females. This assertion may not often be valid. In this study therefore, both inter- and intra-household gender definition are adopted to minimize the limitations from the binary definition of gender in the form of male and female.
