<p id="p0040">This study was carried out in South Tongu and Zabzugu districts of the Volta and Northern regions of Ghana, respectively. The South Tongu district is in the southern part of Ghana and occupies a land area of 643.57square kilometer. Its capital is Sogakope. The district is a coastal district with associated climate change impacts. There are two rainy seasons in a year in the district, the major and minor season, characterized by different raining intensities. The major occupation of the people is farming, particularly, maize and rice crop farming. Zabzugu district is in the Guinea savannah zone (northern Ghana) and covers an area of 1,100.1 square kilometer. Unlike South Tongu district, the Zabzugu district experiences a unimodal rainfall distribution with a mean annual rainfall of 1,125mm. Majority of the households in the district also engage in agriculture and produce crops such as maize, rice and groundnut. Also, these two districts were involved in a climate adaptation strategy program that was led by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Therefore, farmers in the district are largely aware of most climate adaptation strategies in the area.</p>
