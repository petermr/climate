<p id="p0055">The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (means and percentages) and the results presented in tables. Because the sample groups were more than two, the use of student's t-test to determine the significant difference between the groups mean values is inappropriate. Therefore, the study proceeded to estimate the analysis of variance (ANOVA) that allows to compare the mean values of four sampled groups. This was based on the null hypotheses that the mean values were statistically the same. The estimation of ANOVA was justified by the normal distribution of the sample.</p>
