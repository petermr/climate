 <caption> Plasticity of r i in response to initial r i , mass, and temperature. a The spectrum of plastic responses in which individuals with low r i at the beginning of the experiment (Initial r i ) exhibited the greatest increase in r i by the end of the experiment and individuals with high r i did not exhibit plasticity. b Large individuals in the warm treatment (in red) increased r i to the greatest extent relative to individuals in the cool treatment (in blue). Mean responses with 95% confidence intervals are plotted </caption>
