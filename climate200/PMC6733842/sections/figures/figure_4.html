 <caption> Skin resistance modules and candidate genes associated with plasticity in r i . a The module negatively associated with r i . b The module positively associated with r i . These modules provided insight into the mechanisms underlying acclimation of r i by guiding subsequent analyses on gene ontology enrichment and hub gene identification. The figure also identifies four genes ( CHRM3 ( c), TRIM63 ( d), ALOXE3 ( e), and PDE4B ( f)) within the skin resistance modules that correlated to plasticity in r i and were associated with GO terms related to water loss regulation. Temperature and humidity were not associated with the expression of these modules. Regressions are shown with 95% confidence intervals </caption>
