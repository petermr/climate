  <p>Blood vessel formation genes within skin resistance modules related to variation in mass and temperature. The figure illustrates two genes within the skin resistance modules that exhibit an interaction between mass and temperature. The temperature treatments are also identified in red (warm) and blue (cool) clearly illustrating an effect of temperature treatment. The figure illustrates the interaction for stromal interaction molecule 1 (
   <italic>STIM1</italic>) (
   <bold>a</bold>) and rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (
   <italic>RAPGEF1</italic>) (
   <bold>b</bold>). These genes provided insight into the mechanisms underlying temperature as a cue for

   <sub>

   </sub> as they both have the same role in blood vessel development. Regressions are shown with 95% confidence intervals
