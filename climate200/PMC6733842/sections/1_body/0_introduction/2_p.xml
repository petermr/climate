<p id="Par4">Thermal cues are commonly used by plants and animals due to its association with fitness-related biotic and abiotic variables

 <sup>

 </sup>. Temperature has the potential to act as a reliable cue for desiccation risk because warming triggers greater evaporation rates by increasing the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), the primary physical factor driving rates of evaporative water loss
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. VPDs increase with warming because the amount of vapor required to saturate the air (termed the saturation vapor pressure) increases exponentially with temperature

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, and therefore, might represent a cue for greater desiccation risk. High VPDs can impose strong selective pressure by causing large-scale mortality in plants

 </sup> to reduce desiccation risk. Using thermal cues as opposed to hydric also allows organisms to avoid desiccation, rather than responding to the physiological consequences (i.e., dehydration) after they have begun
 <sup>

 </sup>. To date, studies have yet to evaluate the potential for organisms to use temperature as a cue to predict desiccation risk and how these responses are regulated at the genetic level. Identifying the genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity can reveal targets of selection during environmental change
