<p id="Par19">Our analysis revealed a novel perspective on the physiological significance of tissue regeneration. Gene expression analyses suggested that the high resistance to water loss phenotype (and thus low plasticity phenotype) were associated with the constitutive expression of 
 <italic>ALOXE3</italic>, a gene involved in the enzymatic pathway for regulating transepidermal water loss. At the other end of the spectrum, the high plasticity phenotype was associated with genes that regulate vasoconstriction and blood vessel development. Without the continued expression of 
 <italic>ALOXE3</italic>, salamanders appeared to adjust

  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> by limiting blood flow to the skinâ€™s vasculature, an effective strategy to reduce water loss

 </sup>. Not only did salamanders regulate pathways involved in vasoconstriction, hemostasis, and angiogenesis, but also pathways involved in vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of capillaries from hematopoietic stem cells typically confined to embryos

 </sup>. Thus, salamanders may adjust water loss across their skin using their unique ability to regenerate tissues by regulating dermal capillary growth in response to environmental change.
