<p id="Par24">Seminal studies on amphibian water loss physiology have suggested that many amphibians, and salamanders in particular, do not have a physiological resistance to water loss

 </sup>. This reification on amphibian physiology resulted in many studies overlooking variation in water loss physiology or focusing on rare forms of desiccation resistance, such as cocoon formation and waxy secretions

Our study differs from previous evaluations of water loss by carefully measuring changes in vapor pressure contributed by the animal over several weeks under ecologically relevant conditions using an advanced flow-through system. Thus, we strongly advocate for studies that investigate amphibian water loss physiology within and between species to promote the discovery of novel physiological variation and their underlying mechanisms.
