 </sup>. Loss of function mutations in this family of genes results in pathological disorders associated with high transepidermal water loss
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup>, and many mammals and birds rely on ceramides or related fatty acids to limit transepidermal water loss

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. With lower production of ceramides, salamanders might then rely on vascular regression to regulate water loss. Thus, salamanders can achieve their relatively water-tight phenotype through two different pathways: lipid barrier formation or regulation of blood flow to the skin. Our study highlights the potential for complex interactions among underlying mechanisms in a system that has historically been characterized as one-dimensional
