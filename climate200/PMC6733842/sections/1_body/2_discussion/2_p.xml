<p id="Par20">From the broad functional perspective, independent enrichment analyses revealed consistent involvement of genes, gene networks, and known gene pathways related to developmental processes and stem cell differentiation. Each analysis identified the regulation of muscle contraction, blood vessel growth, and stem cell proliferation, suggesting that regeneration of capillary beds is involved in the temperature-sensitive plasticity of resistance to desiccation. We hypothesize that repeated exposure to warm temperatures elicits vascular regression in the capillary beds of the skin. The process of vascular regression begins with sustained vasoconstriction, eventually leading to hemostasis and the programmed cell death of capillary beds over the course of several weeks
