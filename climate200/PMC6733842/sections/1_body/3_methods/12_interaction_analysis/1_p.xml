<p id="Par49">We conducted an additional analysis to explore the interaction between mass and temperature on acclimation of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. For the interaction analysis, we analyzed the interaction between mass and temperature for all genes within the skin resistance modules. We used linear regression analyses with the transformed gene expression value as the dependent variable, mass as a covariate, and temperature as a factor. We also included the interaction between mass and temperature. Then we conducted Type-II ANCOVA using the 
 <italic>car</italic> package to evaluate significance of the interaction for each gene by looping across each gene in 
 <italic>R</italic>. Genes from the skin resistance modules that exhibited a significant interaction between temperature and mass are referred to as 
 <italic>interaction genes</italic>. We assessed the interaction genes for their potential role in water loss regulation by evaluating GO terms associated with each known gene, similar to our previous procedure for identifying candidate genes.
