<p id="Par38">We assembled our de novo transcriptome using 827 million reads from 48 tissue samples (36 skin and 12 heart samples) using Trinity (v. 2.4.0) and standard protocols for strand specific analysis and normalization. We used TransDecoder (version 3.0.1) to reduce the transcriptome to coding regions from all transcript sequences. TransDecoder identified likely coding sequences as those with a minimum open reading frame length of 50 amino acids. We then assigned gene ontology terms, enzyme codes, and KEGG pathways to genes by blasting against all databases using the Blast2GO Cloud Blast Function. We blasted against all known organisms to ensure the highest chance at annotating each gene. The number of blast hits was increased from the default parameter to 20, and the mapping and annotation steps were run using default protocols. RSEM (version 1.3.0) estimated gene and gene isoform expression levels by aligning individual samples back to the transcriptome using Bowtie (version 1.2.1.1). To prepare for differential gene expression analysis, low-expressed genes were filtered out, retaining only those for which approximately one-third of genes had 10 or more counts.</p>
