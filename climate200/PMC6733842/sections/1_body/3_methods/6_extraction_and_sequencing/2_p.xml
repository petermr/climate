<p id="Par36">We extracted total RNA using standard protocols for TRIzol reagent. Prior to library preparation, we purified each sample to remove contaminants (e.g., phenol, ethanol, etc.) using the RNeasy Mini Kit for total RNA (ID: 74136; Qiagen®, 1001 Marshall St., Redwood City, CA 94063). In addition, we treated samples with DNase to limit the possibility of DNA contamination in tandem with the RNeasy Mini Kit. Prior to library preparation, we determined the concentration of total RNA using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to ensure each sample contained sufficient material for library preparation. We prepared each sample using the Illumina TruSeq® mRNA Stranded Kit (Product#: RS-122-2101, Illumina, Inc., 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92122) by following standard protocols. Once again, we used the Qubit Fluorometer to quantify the amount of cDNA prior to sequencing.</p>
