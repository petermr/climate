<p id="Par47">Temperature and humidity might also represent important cues that explain variation within gene co-expression networks. We evaluated the importance of our treatments in affecting gene expression in skin resistance modules using regression analyses. We used the eigengene values from PC1 as our dependent variable, the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> as a covariate, and temperature and humidity as fixed effects. The model also included interactions with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and treatment to determine whether interactions played in important role in affecting gene expression within skin resistance modules. We conducted separate analyses for modules that were negatively and positively associated with 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. Then we used the 
 <italic>car</italic> package to conduct a Type-II ANCOVA to determine whether the treatments influenced gene expression within skin resistance modules.
