<p id="Par48">We identified potential genes underlying plasticity of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> using two methods. First, we evaluated GO term enrichment based upon the genes within modules significantly associated with 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. We reported enrichment for biological processes, cell components, and molecular function for any terms related to the regulation of water loss. These GO terms included lipid metabolism, skin barrier formation, vasoconstriction, angiogenesis, and lipid excretion. We then cross-referenced these GO terms with hub genes significantly associated with 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (as denoted by gene significance and intramodular connectivity) to identify potential genes underlying acclimation of 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. We also identified hub genes (from the WGCNA analysis) that significantly correlated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> that were also associated with GO terms related to water loss.
