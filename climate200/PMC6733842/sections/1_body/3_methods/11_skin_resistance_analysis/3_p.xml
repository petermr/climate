<p id="Par46">Module construction can be leveraged to identify biologically meaningful genes or groups of genes underlying variation in a phenotype. We summarized expression for each module using a principle component analysis (PCA) to calculate eigengenes using the 
 <italic>blockwiseModules</italic> function, which summarized the expression for each sample using the first principle component (PC1) for each module. We then used a Pearson correlation to test for associations between eigengene values and the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for each module using the 
 <italic>cor</italic> function in WGCNA. The resulting 
 <italic>p</italic>-values were estimated using the 
 <italic>corPalueStudent</italic> function in WGCNA. Modules significantly associated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>

  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, referred to as 
 <italic>skin resistance modules</italic>, also identified potential genes based upon intramodular connectivity

 </sup>. Hub genes are defined as having high intramodular connectivity (or module membership (
 <italic>MM</italic>)), and previous research has revealed important biological functions by assessing hub genes

 </sup>. We explored the function of hub genes in subsequent analyses based upon their connectivity score, statistical significance (
 <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05) with a particular phenotype, and their association with enriched GO terms. These methods helped to discover potential genes underlying plasticity of water loss physiology.
