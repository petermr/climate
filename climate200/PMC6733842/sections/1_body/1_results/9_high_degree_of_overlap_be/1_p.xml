<p id="Par18">We determined the degree of overlap between independent transcriptional analyses to evaluate the robustness of our approach. The GSEA and WGCNA analyses shared eight genes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>) and the GSEA and DGE analyses also shared 17 genes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). For genes shared between GSEA and WGCNA analyses, two genes were significantly related to plasticity in

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. These two genes, JAK2 tyrosine kinase (
 <italic>JAK2</italic>) and phosphodiesterase-4B (
 <italic>PDE4B</italic>), are involved in proliferation of stem cells

 </sup> and muscle contraction, respectively. 
 <italic>PDE4B</italic> was also identified in the WGCNA analysis as an important hub gene related to plasticity in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). For the GSEA and DGE overlap, we found several genes involved in stem cell differentiation related to the Jumanji isoforms that were down-regulated in response to warm temperatures (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). These genes are also known to be involved in blood vessel growth

 </sup>. We also found several genes related to muscle contraction (
 <italic>UTRN</italic>), cell differentiation (
 <italic>UNC45B and BCL6</italic>), and angiogenesis (
 <italic>Cav1</italic>). We found four genes that overlapped between the WGCNA and DGE analysis (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>), which involved genes that regulate inhibition of blood flow (hemostasis), lipid synthesis, and protein transport. Interestingly, the gene related to hemostasis (
 <italic>APLP2</italic>) was also correlated with plasticity in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). Assessing overlap revealed robust, common trends between the independent gene expression analyses that supported the role of blood vessel development and lipid barriers in regulating
