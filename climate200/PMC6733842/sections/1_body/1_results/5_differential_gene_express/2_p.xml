<p id="Par11">Lowering the significance threshold of our analyses resulted in similar patterns. At the significance threshold of 0.001, we found four genes that were strongly downregulated in the warm treatments related to Jumonji isoforms (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), a suite of genes involved in regulation of stem cell differentiation

 </sup> and blood vessel growth

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. We also identified four genes associated with heat shock proteins and responses to stress (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). No matter the stringency of the significance threshold, our DGE and GO term enrichment analyses suggested that temperature represents a cue for the downregulation of stem cell differentiation and developmental processes.
