<p id="Par13">We used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify suites of gene networks that were associated with plasticity of

 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. These gene networks can identify important functional groups of genes and candidate genes underlying phenotypic responses

 </sup>. We identified gene networks relevant to plasticity (termed 
 <italic>skin resistance modules</italic>) based upon a moduleâ€™s association with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> over the course of the experiment. Our analysis identified 26 gene networks or modules. One of these modules was negatively correlated with 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), and the other was positively correlated with 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The positively correlated module consisted of 203 genes, and the negatively correlated module consisted of 75 genes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Temperature and humidity did not influence gene expression in either module, but expression of both modules was associated with the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). These analyses revealed that module expression explained 11% and 10% of the change in 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> for the negatively and positively associated modules, respectively.
