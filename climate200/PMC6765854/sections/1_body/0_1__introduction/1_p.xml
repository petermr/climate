<p>The Global Climate Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem (GCTE) is one of the core research topics of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which has received great attention from the international scientific community as well as the international community in general [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vegetation is a key component of the terrestrial ecosystems, and any change in the terrestrial ecosystems will inevitably lead to fluctuations in vegetation type, quantity or quality. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a quantitative parameter that can be used to characterize and reflect the sensitivity of the earthâ€™s surface vegetation coverage and growth status, and it is one of the best indicators for quantitatively characterizing vegetation dynamic changes [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At the same time, NDVI is also considered to be an effective indicator of vegetation productivity [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the 1980s, NDVI has been widely used in studying the impact of climate on vegetation. NDVI dynamics and its correlation with climatic factors have become one of the important research topics of global change [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the environmental conditions have undergone major changes [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Under this background, NDVI dynamics in TP and their response to climate changes have received extensive attention [
