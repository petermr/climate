<p>TP is an important ecological barrier for China and even Asia. In recent years, with the increase of global climate change and human activities, the ecosystems of TP have undergone significant changes. At present, correlation analysis method has been taken to study the relationship between NDVI and climate change in TP and analyze the dynamic change of NDVI value in TP and its correlation with climate change in a certain period of time, and few studies focus on the temporal and spatial variation trends of NDVI value in TP and the NDVI value in response to climate change by comprehensively using the methods of Multiple Nested Time Series Analysis (MNTSA) and GRA. In this study, we use the NDVI in TP calculated from the MODIS MOD09A1 data product from 2001 to 2017 to analyze the temporal and spatial variation trends of NDVI values of different vegetation types in the growing season using the MNTSA method. At the same time, combining climatic data such as air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity and sunshine duration of the study area, the lagging response of NDVI to climate factors is analyzed in the growing season of the past 17 years. On the basis of this, combined with the elevation data, the difference of the NDVI value in the growing season and the Grey Relational Degree (GRD) of the climatic factors in the study area at different elevations is analyzed. Together with nested time series, the relationship between vegetation and climatic factors in the growing season is analyzed from the perspective of the influencing degree of NDVI to different climatic factors and the lag time of different climatic factors, so as to promote the deepening and expansion of the research field of vegetation-climate relationship.</p>
