 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The northwestern TP is cold and arid, while the southeast is warm and humid. The hydrothermal environment in TP is cold at high altitudes, hot and humid at low altitudes. Therefore the vegetation types show a regional differentiation both horizontally and vertically (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The vegetation in the southeastern mountainous area mainly displays a vertical structure, where there are many tropical rain forests, subtropical evergreen forests and cold-temperate coniferous forests from the foothills to the top of the mountain. In the central hinterland, there are mainly alpine meadows, alpine grasslands and alpine grassland, while deserts are widely distributed in the northwest alpine.
