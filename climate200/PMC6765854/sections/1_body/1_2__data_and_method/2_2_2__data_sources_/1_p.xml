<p>The remote sensing data is derived from the surface reflectance data (MOD09A1) of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) released by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (
 <uri xlink:href="https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/</uri>). The MOD09A1 product is an 8 d synthetic L3 surface reflectivity product, which contains seven bands. The spatial resolution of the near infrared and red bands is 250 m and for the rest it is 500 m.
