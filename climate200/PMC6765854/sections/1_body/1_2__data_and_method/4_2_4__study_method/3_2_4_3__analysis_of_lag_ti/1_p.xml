<p>Vegetation has certain adaptability to climate change. Only when climate change reaches a certain level, can vegetation change take place, that is, the response of vegetation to climate change has a certain time lag. The NDVI sequence of the growing season in the study area from 2001 to 2017 (May–September) and the monthly mean air temperature sequence of the growing season are taken as two groups of variables for calculating the GRD between NDVI and monthly mean air temperature. Similarly, to calculate the GRD of NDVI sequence of the growing season and the monthly mean air temperature (April–August, March–August, and February–June), we use monthly cumulative precipitation (May–September, April–August, March–July and February–June), monthly mean relative humidity (May–September, April–August, March–July, and February–June) and monthly cumulative sunshine duration (May–September, April–August, March–July, and February–June), respectively. By comparing NDVI in the growing season with the GRD of the same comparative factor at different moments, the lag time of the NDVI to the climatic factors is discussed in the growing season.</p>
