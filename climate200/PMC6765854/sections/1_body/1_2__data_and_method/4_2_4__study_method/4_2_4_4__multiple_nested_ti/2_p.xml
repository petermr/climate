<p>MNTSA may face the Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem (MTUP) in statistics, but studies have shown that the MTUP effect can be ignored when multiple nested time series method is applied to calculate NDVI variation trends and their responses to climatic factors [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. At the same time, the method is prominent in reflecting the dynamic process of NDVI, the persistence and stability of the variation trend. Long-term time series analysis of NDVI based on multiple nested periods helps to understand the persistence of NDVI variation process and variation trends, and it can reflect the elasticity of the vegetation system and the resistance to external disturbances to some extent.
