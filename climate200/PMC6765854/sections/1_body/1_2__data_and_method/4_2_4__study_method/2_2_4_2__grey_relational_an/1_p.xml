<p>Multi-variate statistical analysis often uses correlation analysis and regression analysis. The multiple regression analysis method requires samples to obey a typical probability distribution, which has a large amount of calculation and a complicated calculation process. Correlation analysis method generally requires that each variable meet the joint normal distribution, and in the analysis process, the extreme value of the factor will have a greater impact on the relevant analysis results, and even lead to the distortion of the essential association among the factors [

The GRA has the characteristics of not being restricted by the type of samples and the probability distribution, known as an effective method to study an uncertain issue with little data and information. The basic idea of GRA is based on the geometric similarity of curves. The curves of two series are more similar, the series are more relevant, and vice versa [

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] utilized GRA to analyse change-points in hydrological time series and water environment quality, and found that GRA should be expected to be applicable in other disciplines, too. But the related studies were mainly based on the overall statistical value of the study area or limited sample points, thus the results lacked detailed description of the distribution of GRD in the study area. The basic steps and related formulas of GRA are as follows:
