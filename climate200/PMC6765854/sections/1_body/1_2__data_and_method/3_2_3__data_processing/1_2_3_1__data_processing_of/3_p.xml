 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Next, using the method of Maximum Value Composite (MVC), monthly NDVI in the growing season (May-September) are calculated. Subsequently, the effects of bare soil and sparse vegetation areas are eliminated based on the following rules: (1) the annual mean NDVI of the growing season is greater than 0.1; (2) the maximum annual NDVI is greater than 0.15; (3) the maximum annual NDVI should occur from July to September [

 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, the mean NDVI from May to September of the year 2001â€“2017, which meet the pixel requirements above, will be used as the annual mean value of NDVI in the growing season.
