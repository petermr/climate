<p>The relative difference in height of TP is large, and the diverse climate types and the vegetation’s strong sensitivity to climate result in uneven spatial distribution of the ecological patterns. Overall, the NDVI distribution in the growing season shows a trend of decreasing from east to west, with a change rate of −0.13/10° E (
