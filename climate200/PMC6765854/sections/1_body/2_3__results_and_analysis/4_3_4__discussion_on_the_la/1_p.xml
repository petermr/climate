<p>According to the statistical results of the GRD and the NDVI in the growing season of the study area in 2017 to mean air temperature, cumulative precipitation, mean relative humidity and cumulative sunshine duration in different time sequences (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03452-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) show that during the growing season, the NDVI has the highest average GRD with mean air temperature from May to September (0.613), with cumulative precipitation from May to September and from April to August (0.616), with relative humidity from March to July (0.614), and with cumulative sunshine duration from February to June (0.631). It indicates that the NDVI of the growing season in the study area lags behind air temperature not obviously, cumulative precipitation by 0â€“1 month, relative humidity by 2 months, and sunshine duration by 3 months. That is, the vegetation in the growing season of the study area responds more quickly to air temperature and precipitation, while the response to relative humidity is slower, and the response to sunshine duration is the slowest.
