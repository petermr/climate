<p>The study area is divided into four altitude ranges: low altitude area (&lt;1000 m), middle altitude area (1000–3500 m), high altitude area (3500–5000 m) and extremely high altitude area (&gt;5000 m) [

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03452-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The areas with increasing trend of NDVI at all altitude ranges are larger than those with decreasing trend. Among low altitude areas (81.22% vs. 18.78%), medium altitude areas (80.81% vs. 19.19%), high altitude areas (65.8% vs. 34.2 %), extremely high altitude areas (62.7% vs. 37.3%), the middle altitude areas cover the largest area where NDVI value shows extremely significant increase (20.03%) and significant increase (33.14%), while extremely high altitude areas cover the smallest area with extremely significant increase (3.54%) and significant increase (19.32%). It shows that the improvement of vegetation in the middle and low-altitude areas is better than that of high-altitude and extremely high-altitude area in 2001–2017. The proportion of area where NDVI value of vegetation shows extremely significant increase and extremely significant reduction in the mid-altitude area is the largest among the four elevation ranges, probably due to human factors in the mid-altitude area.
