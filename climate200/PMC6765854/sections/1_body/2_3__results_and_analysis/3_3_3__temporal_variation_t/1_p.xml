<p>From the periods of 2001–2011, 2001–2012, ..., 2001–2017, the proportion of area showing different NDVI variation trends in the growing season of TP tells that areas where NDVI values showing an increasing trend do not display a visible trend as the study period prolongs. In terms of all periods in the growing season, areas with increasing trend of NDVI values are larger than those with decreasing trend, and the areas with extremely significant increasing trend are also larger than those with significant reduction trend. Areas with extremely significant reduction trend of NDVI value in the growing season show an obvious trend, and the growth rate is greater than that of the extremely significant increase area (

Under the background of the overall increase of NDVI value, the area with decreasing NDVI is gradually expanding.
