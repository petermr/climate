<p>In terms of vegetation types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f007">Figure 7</xref>), the overall NDVI value of each vegetation type increases by more than 50%, but the areas with increasing NDVI in meadows and grasslands show a shrinking trend, and areas with a significant increase show a shrinking trend, while areas with significant reduction display a trend of expansion. The areas with significant increase of NDVI value of cultivated vegetation show a trend of expansion, so does the area with significant reduction. The area with increasing NDVI value of the forest area continues to increase. The above studies show that the variation trend of some NDVI will be covered by the overall change in the background of an overall increase of NDVI value. Previous studies have shown that climate warming has greatly increased the evaporation in TP. Therefore, the increase of air temperature can promote vegetation growth, on the other hand, it may also suppress the growth of some vegetation, and human disturbance such as overgrazing will lead to grassland degradation [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, areas with increasing trend and significantly increasing trend of NDVI in meadows and grasslands are reducing, which is opposite to the overall variation trend. It is likely to take place due to the synergy of climate warming and human disturbance. The areas with significantly increasing trend and significant reduction trend of NDVI show a trend of expansion, indicating that there coexists returning farmland to grass or returning farmland to forest and abandoned farming in cultivated vegetation. The areas with significant increasing trend and extremely significant increasing trend of NDVI in forest land (coniferous forest and broad-leaved forest) are continuously increasing, which may result from the protection measures of natural forest resources and returning farmland to forests.
