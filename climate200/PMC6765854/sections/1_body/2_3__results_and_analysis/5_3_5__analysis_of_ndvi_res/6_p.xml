<p>The GRD between NDVI and climatic factors in the growing season of TP is significantly different. The GRD between NDVI and air temperature is the highest (0.632) in the low-altitude area, and the lowest (0.608) in the high-altitude area; the GRD with the sunshine duration is the highest (0.703) in the low-altitude area, and the lowest (0.626) in the extremely high-altitude area; the GRD with relative humidity is the highest (0.623) in the middle-altitude area and the lowest (0.612) in the high-altitude area; the GRD with precipitation is the highest (0.625) in the extremely high-altitude area and the lowest (0.588) in the low-altitude area. The cumulative sunshine duration of the study area is more dominant than the other climatic factors and the NDVI of the growing season has the closest relation to the duration of sunshine. In the middle and low altitude areas, the response of NDVI to air temperature and relative humidity is much higher than that of precipitation. The correlation between sunshine duration and cumulative precipitation in the middle and low altitude areas is generally negative, and in the area where the correlation with sunshine duration is high, the correlation with cumulative precipitation is low, but the difference of correlations between the remaining climatic factors are more obvious. In high-altitude areas, the response of NDVI to precipitation is much higher than that of air temperature and relative humidity. The correlation between sunshine duration, precipitation, air temperature and relative humidity is quite different, but the correlation between sunshine duration and air temperature in eastern Haixi County reflects certain consistency. At extremely high-altitude area, the response of NDVI to precipitation is much higher than that of air temperature, and the response to air temperature is much higher than that of relative humidity. In extremely high-altitude area, the natural environment is extremely bad, and the response of NDVI to climate factors is quite different. Since the amount of thick clouds can easily reduce sunshine hours [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-03452" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the correlation between NDVI and sunshine duration is often low in the area where NDVI is highly correlated with relative humidity and cumulative precipitation, and the correlation between NDVI and sunshine duration in the region where NDVI is associated with relative humidity and cumulative precipitation is often higher.
