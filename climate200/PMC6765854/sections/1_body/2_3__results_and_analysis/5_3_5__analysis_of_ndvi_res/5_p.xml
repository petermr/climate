<p>The correlation between NDVI and sunshine duration in different areas is significantly different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f008">Figure 8</xref>d). The grey correlation between NDVI and cumulative sunshine duration ranges from 0.395 to 0.941, with an average of 0.631, and the NDVI values of meadows, shrubs and broad-leaved forests are highly correlated with the duration of sunshine in southeastern Tibet, eastern Tibet and northeastern part of the study area. The high-value (&gt;0.631) areas are more evenly distributed in the study area, especially concentrated in the southeastern part of Tibet, eastern Tibet and the northeastern part of the study area. The vegetation types are mainly meadows, shrubs and broad-leaved forests. The low-value (&lt;0.631) areas are distributed in the study area and is concentrated in the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, where the vegetation types are mainly grassland and meadow. The correlation between NDVI of the growing season and sunshine duration in the low-altitude area is 0.703, the mid-altitude area 0.645, the high-altitude area 0.628, and the extremely high-altitude area 0.626 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f009">Figure 9</xref>). It indicates that in the low-altitude area of the study area, most of the areas are affected by the duration of sunshine, and the extent of effect is much higher than that of the middle, high and extremely high altitude area. With the increase of altitude, the influence of sunshine duration on vegetation gradually declines. The reason may be that the low-altitude area is located in the southeastern part of the study area, where clouds are thick, and the southeastern part of TP receives less solar radiation than other parts of the plateau. Therefore, vegetation in the high southeastern part has high sensitivity of the abnormal sunshine duration. The correlation between NDVI and sunshine duration at high altitude and extremely high altitude does not reduce with the dramatic change of altitude.
