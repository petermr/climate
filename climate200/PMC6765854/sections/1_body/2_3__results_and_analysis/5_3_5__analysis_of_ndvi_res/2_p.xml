<p>The GRD of the low altitude area is 0.632, the middle altitude 0.627, the high altitude 0.608, and the extremely high altitude 0.621 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f009">Figure 9</xref>). On the whole, with the increase of altitude, the GRD between NDVI and mean air temperature shows a downward trend. When the altitude ranges from middle to high, the GRD drops sharply to 0.608, but roses to 0.621 at extremely high altitude, indicating that the correlation between NDVI and air temperature is higher at extremely high-altitude, mid-altitude and low-altitude areas, and the correlation between NDVI and air temperature reduces due to complex hydrothermal conditions and extremely harsh natural environment at high altitude.
