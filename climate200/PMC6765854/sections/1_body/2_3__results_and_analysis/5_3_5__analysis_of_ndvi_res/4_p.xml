<p>The correlation analysis between NDVI and relative humidity in the study area shows that, the GRDs between NDVI and relative humidity ranges from 0.402 to 0.93 with an average of 0.614 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f008">Figure 8</xref>c). The high-value area (&gt;0.614) is evenly distributed throughout the study area. The main vegetation types are grassland, meadow, coniferous forest, and alpine vegetation. The low-value (&lt;0.614) area is mainly distributed in the eastern part of the study area, northwestern Sichuan Province, central Tibet and northeastern Qinghai Province. The vegetation types include meadows, grasslands, broad-leaved forests and shrubs. The correlation between NDVI and relative humidity at different altitudes ranks in descending order: middle-altitude area (0.623), low-altitude area (0.618), extremely high-altitude area (0.613) and high-altitude area (0.612) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03452-f009">Figure 9</xref>). In the middle and low altitude areas, the correlation between NDVI value and relative humidity is the highest in the growing season, while the correlation between NDVI and relative humidity is relatively low due to the dry climate in the high-altitude areas and extremely high-altitude areas.
