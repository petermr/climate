<p>Here, we examine the interrelationships of seabed temperatures along the oceanographically distinct Gulf of Maine and how they relate to lobster demography after larval settlement. Specifically, we suggest that the combination of thermally mediated sounding behavior of lobsters, particularly in areas susceptible to ocean stratification, decouples the easily measured SST from the more relevant bottom temperatures. This not only paints a different picture of how ocean warming may affect the distribution and abundance of the American lobster but it also alters how we interpret decades of young‐of‐year (YoY) settlement data that have consistently declined for approximately a decade in the Gulf of Maine. At stake is whether the single most valuable fisheries species in North America is on a trajectory of decline.</p>
