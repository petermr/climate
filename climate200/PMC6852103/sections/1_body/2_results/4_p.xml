<p>Northeast–southwest differences in thermal regime, water column structure, and ocean warming are largely driven by differences in the degree of vertical mixing (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Summer maxima in the northeastern Gulf of Maine typically ranges from 11 to 13°C uniformly across all depths to 100 m, whereas in the southwestern Gulf of Maine summer temperatures may reach 16–18°C at the surface, but only 7–8°C at depths &gt;50 m. Average summer temperatures from 0 to 25 m have exceeded the 12°C lobster settlement threshold in both regions; however, warming trends suggest that this has occurred only recently (~1980s) in the northeastern Gulf of Maine. In contrast, temperatures between 25 and 50 m in the northeast were considerably warmer than the southwest and reached the 12°C settlement threshold starting in 1999–2000. At depths between 25 and 50 m, temperatures have warmed at similar rates between the southwest and northeast. However, bottom temperatures have warmed considerably faster between 50 and 100 m in the northeast causing the seabed to approach the 12°C settlement threshold sooner than the southwest (

 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and warm at a slower rate (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In contrast, the northeastern Gulf of Maine is well mixed causing surface and bottom water temperatures to converge (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and warm at similar rates (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).
