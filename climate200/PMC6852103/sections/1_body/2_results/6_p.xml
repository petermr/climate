<p>The YoY lobster time series with and without expanded habitat give alternative views of settlement trends, and thus have important implications for year class strength (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We start in 2000, the year greater than 50% of the current monitoring sites are represented. In the southwestern Gulf of Maine, unadjusted YoY densities rose slightly to a high in ~2005–2007 before declining about fourfold to a time‐series low in 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Incorporating expanded thermal habitat offsets those declines and implies that YoY abundance has remained relatively stable in the southwestern Gulf of Maine through 2010, rose sharply in 2011, and then fell to time‐series lows after 2013 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b,c). Both extrapolated YoY abundances follow this trend, but the magnitude of the 2011 peak and time‐series average are 30% and 20% lower, respectively, in the depth and substrate scaled model. Attention should also be given to the 2011 peak as it falls outside 3x the interquartile range of the time series for both models, typically characteristic of an extreme outlier (Tukey, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">1977</xref>); however, similar extreme recruitment events are common in marine populations (e.g., Hjort, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">1914</xref>). In the northeastern Gulf of Maine, YoY densities rose sharply from 2000 to sustained high levels ~2005–2008, roughly twice the peak levels in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. Subsequently, northeastern ALSI declined sharply 10‐fold to a time‐series low in 2013 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Incorporating thermal habitat expansion generates two peaks in abundance, one near 2005 and another in 2012, followed by a decline to near the time‐series average by 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b,c). Both extrapolated YoY abundances follow this trend; however, the depth and substrate scaled model produces a 21% lower time‐series average, 24% lower 2012 peak, 16% lower 2005 peak, and a maximum value occurring in 2005 rather than in 2012. In effect, extrapolating densities over the area of thermally suitable habitat advances time‐series highs, and in the northeastern Gulf of Maine it reduces the magnitude of potential decline from 10‐ to twofold.
