<p>However, the northeast and southwest sectors (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) showed distinctively different trajectories in landings on a per unit coastline basis (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). In the early 1990s, the southwest region landed four times as many lobsters per unit length coastline as the northeast. At that time, landings in both entered a linear growth phase (~1989â€“2008). Northeastern landings grew much faster than southwestern landings during this phase so that by ~2007 landings per unit coastline were similar in northeastern and southwestern Maine. Soon thereafter, the northeastern coastal fishery entered a phase of geometric growth, greatly surpassing landings in the southwest even as they continued to grow, so that by 2015 the northeastern landings per unit coastline were 80% higher than in the southwest (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).
