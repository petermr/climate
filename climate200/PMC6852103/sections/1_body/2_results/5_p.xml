<p>The area of seabed exposed to temperatures warmer than 12°C has changed over the past decade and a half. In both regions, this area declined from 2000 to 2007, increased from 2007 to 2012, and declined again from 2012 to 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The range of habitat area warmer than 12°C is greatest in the northeast compared to the southwest. However, the magnitude of this difference depends on the depth to which thermal habitats are considered (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). The northeast has significantly higher variances, at the 0.05 level, of the area of seabed warmer than 12°C from 2000 to 2015 for regions shallower than 25 m (

 <sub>15,15</sub> = 2.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .03) and 100 m (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>15,15</sub> = 3.64, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .01), but is marginally insignificant for regions shallower than 50 m (

 <sub>15,15</sub> = 2.25, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .06). In the southwestern Gulf of Maine, because of the steep thermocline, habitat area dynamics were limited to a limited range of depths. In the northeastern Gulf of Maine, vertical mixing and increased susceptibility in offshore boundary heat flux dynamics (Mountain, Strout, &amp; Beardsley, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>) increased the suitable thermal habitat resulting in both a northeastward and depth‐wise expansion. In both regions of the Gulf of Maine, we found significant negative correlations between the area of seabed warmer than 12°C and YoY density (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; southwestern Gulf of Maine: 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.60, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 14; northeastern Gulf of Maine: 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.61, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) indicating that periods of high habitat availability correlate with periods of low settlement density. The slopes of these relationships were not statistically different between regions; 
 <italic>t</italic>(24) = 1.31, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .20. The strength of the inverse relationship between the area of seabed warmer than 12°C and YoY density was relatively constant when regressions were performed on thermal habitats 0–25, 0–50, and 0–100 m (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Similar inverse relationships between surface and bottom temperatures to settlement density were found, indicating that periods of warmer ocean temperatures correspond with periods of low settlement density (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).
