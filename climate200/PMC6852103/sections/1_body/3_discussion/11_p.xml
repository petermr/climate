<p>Global models of climate change will continue to provide a valuable coarse‐scale view of the impact of ocean warming on world fisheries, but they do not capture finer scale coastal processes that surely affect how fishery productivity will play out on a local scale. We demonstrate here that local oceanography, coupled with nonlinear species‐specific responses to warming, may have led to a demographic expansion disproportionate to the relatively small change in temperature. By virtue of local differences in vertical mixing, the Gulf of Maine has different susceptibilities to offshore warming that can lead to differences in future productivity. In the case of the American lobster, we argue that ocean warming drove a northeastward population surge in the Gulf resulting from an expansion of the area of seabed across a biologically important thermal threshold for larval settlement. We suggest this northeastward expansion largely contributed to the historic sixfold increase in lobster harvests that has elevated the fishery to its high national ranking in value. We, therefore, argue that the fate of fisheries in a changing climate requires a better understanding of interactions between local oceanography and species traits.</p>
