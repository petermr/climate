<p>Deep‐water settlement data obtained by the ALSI research collaborative along New England and Atlantic Canada from 2007 to 2008 (Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and 2016 to 2018 (R. Wahle, unpublished) provide corroborating evidence of depth‐wise patterns of settlement. They confirm how strongly depth‐wise settlement patterns in the Gulf of Maine are influenced by the degree of thermal stratification. In the northeast GoM, settlement below 25 m has been on the order of nine times as high as at the same depth in the southwest. It is, therefore, more likely that the boom in landings in the east was amplified by a broader depth‐wise component not present in the western GoM. Regrettably, no deep‐water settlement data are available prior to 2007 that might have better documented the status of settlement patterns in the preboom years.
