<p>The YoY recruitment time series with and without expanded habitat give alternative views of settlement trends, and thus have important implications for year class strength and stock assessment. To the extent settlement trends may predict subsequent fishery recruitment (e.g., Oppenheim, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Wahle, Bergeron, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), the unmodified ALSI YoY index suggests an impending downturn, whereas the index extrapolated over thermally suitable habitat suggests a more sustained trajectory of high abundance and a delayed downturn. Currently, the ALSI YoY densities are included in the American lobster stock assessment as an indicator of the health of the resource (ASMFC, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>); however, environmental variability, such as thermally suitable habitat, is not included. Similar to our findings, incorporating environmental variability into the lobster stock assessment model impacts estimates of annual recruitment (Tanaka et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Thus, it may be especially important to account for environmental variability and rapid demographic changes across critical biological thresholds, such as that observed in the northeastern Gulf of Maine: roughly a doubling in optimal thermal habitat from 2008 to 2012 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Consequently, YoY density corrections incorporating environmental variability may provide a more accurate representation of lobster recruitment in a rapidly warming part of the ocean.
