<p>Clearly, the role of climate change on the distribution and abundance of organisms is steadily gaining attention in all sectors from the public to managers and policy makers. Rates of poleward migration or "climate velocity" of commercially important species have been well documented (Nye et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Pinsky &amp; Fogarty, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and generally conform to well‚Äêestablished patterns of thermogeography driving biogeography (Adey &amp; Steneck, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Hutchins, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1947</xref>). However, beyond simple patterns of temperature and organism distribution are complex processes and mechanisms (such as a thermal envelope) driving those patterns. Our proposed mechanistic explanation of climate velocities incorporates warming in the context of realized essential habitat (e.g., nursery habitat) and biological thresholds for a commercially important species. When seabed temperatures exceed the thermal threshold, the probability of lobster settlement onto previously cooler and uninhabitable areas increased. However, contrasting stratified and unstratified water masses differentially affects seabed warming and thus lobster recruitment.
