<p>The American Lobster Settlement Index (ALSI) is an annual monitoring program that quantitates settlement densities of YoY lobster across New England and Atlantic Canada. ALSI was initiated in 1989 at a few sampling locations in midcoast Maine (Incze &amp; Wahle, 
 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>) and has since expanded to more than 100 sites ranging from Rhode Island, USA, to Newfoundland, CAN sampled either by diver‐based suction sampling (Incze &amp; Wahle,

 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>) or by passive postlarval collectors (Wahle, Bergeron, et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14778-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The Gulf of Maine time series used in this study was entirely generated by the diver‐based method. Sampling is conducted at the end of the settlement season in September and October. YoY lobster densities are an indicator of lobster year class strength (Incze &amp; Wahle,
