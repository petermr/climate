<p>Many recent studies necessarily use SST to characterize temperature exposure of benthic organisms. In this study, we used numerical model output that assimilates SST but has the advantage of using local bathymetry and explicitly incorporates tidal mixing to improve bottom water temperature estimates. NOAA's Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecasting System (NECOFS; an implementation of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model [FVCOM]) was used to estimate year‐to‐year variability in the area of a thermally suitable seabed for lobster settlement. NECOFS is a three‐dimensional ocean circulation model codeveloped by the University of Massachusetts‐Dartmouth and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Chen, Beardsley, &amp; Cowles,
