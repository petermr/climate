<p>We reasoned that if the area of thermally suitable seabed varied in time, interannual variability in YoY density alone could misrepresent the true time trend in lobster year class strength. One consequence of expanding habitat could be that larval settlement spreads over a larger area with correspondingly reduced densities while extrapolated abundances may be stable or even increasing. We refer to this as the “thermally mediated dilution hypothesis.” As a partial test of that hypothesis, we evaluated the relationship between the area of seabed warmer than 12°C (from NECOFS) and YoY lobster density. For each region we conducted least‐squares regressions between NERACOOS SST versus YoY density, NERACOOS bottom temperature versus YoY density, NECOFS SST versus YoY density, NECOFS bottom temperature versus YoY density, and seabed area &gt;12°C versus YoY density using annual values and 3 year moving block averages from 2000 to 2015. Three year moving block average values were used in an attempt to minimize the influence of other elements on inshore lobster settlement patterns, including abiotic and biotic factors modulating larval supply (Xue, Incze, Xu, Wolff, &amp; Pettigrew,
