 <p>Ocean warming has rapidly expanded the amount of thermally suitable bottom habitat for settling American lobster postlarvae in the Gulf of Maine. Local oceanography, coupled with nonlinear responses to warming, may have led to a demographic expansion disproportionate to the relatively small change in bottom temperature. Habitat expansion offshore may explain population increases northeastward and decreases in inshore settlement densities.
