 <caption> Estimated bottom habitat with temperatures &gt;12°C (km 2) shallower than 50 m in the southwestern and northeastern Gulf of Maine between 2000 and 2015 from NECOFS modeled bottom temperatures. Inset maps compare the area of seabed subject to temperatures &gt;12°C during a cool year (2004) and a warm year (2012) in the two areas. Black dots on maps are American lobster settlement index sampling locations. Solid lines denote a 3 year moving block average </caption>
