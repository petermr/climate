 <caption> Two ways of viewing southwest–northeast differences in the Gulf of Maine's thermal regime and warming. (a) FVCOM‐modeled Aug. to Oct. bottom temperatures 1985–2015 and rates of change in two depth zones. Solid red line: 12°C threshold. Dashed lines: least‐squares regressions. Regression statistics can be found in Table S3. (b) Relationship between observed surface (1 m) and bottom (50 m) temperatures at NERACOOS buoys in southwestern and northeastern Gulf of Maine, 2001–2017. Southwest: Y = −0.256 x + 13.9, N = 1,524, R 2 = 0.18, p &lt; .001. Northeast: Y = 0.467 x + 4.9, N = 1,556, R 2 = 0.22, p &lt; .001. Black dotted line: 1:1 relationship; when points fall on that line, the water column is well mixed. Red dashed line: 12°C threshold. Inset: Interpretation of how east and west summer temperature profiles change in a warming ocean (black arrow) </caption>
