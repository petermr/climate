<p id="Par34">Citizens living in informal settlements (slums) constitute a significant percentage of the urban population. A recent estimate states that 32.7% of the world’s population in developing regions is living in slums (UN-HABITAT 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>). There were more slum dwellers in 2012 than in 2000, a trend that will likely continue in the future (WWAP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2017</xref>). Slum dwellers frequently rely on unsewered communal toilets, use open spaces or dispose of faeces in polythene bags. The inequality in sanitary services is significant. For instance, in India 56% of the population in the top 20% (household-income groups) has access to piped water, compared with 6% of the bottom 20% (World Bank
