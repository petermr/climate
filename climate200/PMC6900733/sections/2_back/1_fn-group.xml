  <p>*In a comprehensive Earth system model, the computational cost of parametrized representations of poorly known Earth system processes typically exceeds the computational cost of the well-understood fluid mechanics represented by the dynamical core, sometimes by a considerable margin.</p>

  <p>
   <sup>â€ </sup>Because parametrizations are only approximate representations of physical processes, model parameters are not well constrained by theory. As a result, they are typically tuned, or optimized, to ensure that there is a good balance between incoming solar and outgoing terrestrial irradiances at the top of the atmosphere and that this balance is achieved at as close to the observed global temperature as possible (
