<p>Now that the blurry outlines of global climate change have been settled, the need to sharpen the picture (
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>) has become more urgent (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, such sharpening is proving to be more challenging than anticipated—something that we attribute to the inadequacy of our models (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>–
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Unfortunately, many in the community—notably those in charge of science funding—have no idea how significant and widespread these inadequacies are. This has arisen in part because of a justified desire to communicate, with as much clarity as possible, the aspects of our science that are well settled. While we are certainly not claiming that model inadequacies cast doubt on these well-settled issues, we are claiming that, by deemphasizing what our models fail to do, we inadvertently contribute to complacency with the state of modeling. This leaves the scientific consensus on climate change vulnerable to specious arguments that prey on obvious model deficiencies; gives rise to the impression that defending the fidelity of our most comprehensive models is akin to defending the fidelity of the science; and most importantly, fails to communicate the need and importance of doing better.
