 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), illustrates this situation well. It shows that all of the climate models can adequately reproduce the observed change in temperature—part of what we call the blurry outline of climate change. This is something that the Assessment Report draws attention to in its summary for policy makers. What is not discussed in the summary is what is shown by the thin horizontal lines on the edge of

 </xref> models differ among themselves in their estimates of surface temperature by an amount that is 2 to 3 times as large as the observed warming and larger yet than the estimated 0.5 °C uncertainty in the observations. The deemphasis of this type of information, while helpful for focusing the reader on the settled science, contributes to the impression that, while climate models can never be perfect, they are largely fit for purpose. However, for many key applications that require regional climate model output or for assessing large-scale changes from small-scale processes, we believe that the current generation of models is not fit for purpose.
