  <title>Box 2. A new approach to global climate modeling</title>
  <p>We are suggesting a new approach to climate model development (
   <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). This approach should aim to reduce climate models’ dependence on subgrid parameterizations where possible and account for their uncertainty where not. To be successful, this approach must master and motivate technological innovations, particularly in computing, and be given a sense of purpose commensurate to the task at hand.

  <p>Global storm and ocean-eddy resolving [
   <italic>O</italic>(1 km)] models make it possible to directly simulate deep convection, ocean mesoscale eddies, and important land–atmosphere interactions. Prototypes of such models are already being developed (
   <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), 3 examples of which are compared with a satellite image. By avoiding the need to represent essential processes by semiempirical parameterizations, the simulated climate of such a model is more constrained by the laws of physics. This can be expected to lead to the reduction or even elimination of many systematic biases that plague the present generations of models (

   <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>Commensurate with this focus on high resolution, uncertainties in the parameterization of remaining subgrid (or nonfluid-dynamical) processes should be represented explicitly through some application of stochastic modeling (
   <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Among other advantages, this will ensure that such parameterizations are not unjustifiably complex—or overfit to past changes—and that the numerical precision of both parameterizations and dynamical cores is commensurate with their information content (
   <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Data-driven methods could also play an important role in reducing computational costs and in improving the representation of processes that cannot be constrained by first principles (
   <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>We can expect that such models will have substantially reduced biases against observations and a better characterization of uncertainty. Already, signs of improved prediction skill for tropical intraseasonal variability are emerging from prototype models with convective permitting resolution (
   <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This will radically enhance the reliability of regional climate projections. However, by how much? There is no overarching theory of the Navier–Stokes equation from which such questions can be answered [indeed, some of the most basic mathematical properties of these equations are still unknown (
   <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)]. Nor can we presently partition uncertainty in predictions among fluid-dynamical vs. nonfluid-dynamical (cloud microphysics, land-surface properties, biogeochemistry) contributions to climate change. This means that the only way to answer such questions is to actually develop and run such models. This is largely the way in which the benefits of increased resolution in numerical weather prediction were quantified. These benefits have been so enormous that no one would seriously contemplate returning to weather forecast model resolutions of say the 1980s and utilize the saved computer resources for other applications (
   <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>The development of this new generation of models should be sustained, multinational, and coordinated as a flagship application of high-performance computing and information technology. Only as a coordinated technology project will it be possible to meet the computational challenges of running the highest possible resolution models and accessing their full information content. How to structure such an initiative can be debated; indisputable is the necessity to endow it with the same sense of purpose that has made past grand scientific challenges—from weather forecasting to moon landings—so successful.</p>
  <p>The importance of developing predictions of climate with reliable regional precision is so important that we simply have to give this our best shot. Failing to do so keeps society in the dark about the possible ways that our climate system might develop in the coming years and decades.</p>
