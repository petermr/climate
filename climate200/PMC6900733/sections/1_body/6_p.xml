 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), these problems are demonstrably more serious still, as model bias (compared with observations) is often many times greater than the signals that the models attempt to predict. In a nonlinear system, particularly one as important as our model of Earth’s climate, one cannot be complacent about biases with such magnitudes. Both basic physics and past experience (at least on timescales that observations constrain) teach us that our ability to predict natural fluctuations of the climate system is limited by such biases (

By downplaying the potential significance that model inadequacies have on our ability to provide reliable estimates of climate change, including of course in terms of extremes of weather and climate, we leave policy makers (and indeed, the public in general) ignorant of the extraordinary challenge it is to provide a sharper and more physically well-grounded picture of climate change, essentially depriving them of the choice to do something about it.
