<p>The distribution of potential vegetation over the period 1982–1996 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref>) was similar to that over the period 1997–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Changes in potential vegetation mainly occurred on the boundaries between adjacent types of vegetation from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Obvious boundary changes were seen between tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests, between tropical deserts and the Sahel, and between temperate deciduous and evergreen forests. After comparison with the existing vegetation changes, actual changes in existing vegetation caused by climate variations were only detected in a limited number of grid cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3D</xref>). These grid cells were distributed worldwide, mainly in the ecotones.
