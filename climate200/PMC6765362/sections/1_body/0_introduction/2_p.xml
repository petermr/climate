<p>Human disturbances and climate change are the two main factors that determine the changes in regional vegetation distribution. The land surface of the Earth has been modified by human activities (e.g.,Â farming, construction and grazing) for centuries, and it has been significantly changed by human activities (

With the continuous expanding human settlements, the distribution of vegetation types across the globe has changed markedly compared with the potential distribution of vegetation types which reflect vegetation distribution in the absence of anthropogenic influences.
