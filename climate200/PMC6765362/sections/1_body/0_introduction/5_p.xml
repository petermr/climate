<p>In this study, we delimit the influence of human disturbance and climate on the distribution of vegetation based on updated data from 1982 to 2013. Accordingly, our main goals were to (1) delineate the influence of human disturbance versus climate on the vegetation distribution, and (2) identify those regions most susceptible to human disturbance in recent period.</p>
