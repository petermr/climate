<p>The potential vegetation changes were indicated by the changes in climate types over the two periods. However, whether or not the potential vegetation change was reflected in the real vegetation changes should be verified by checking the overlapped changes in both potential vegetation and existing vegetation. When changes were detected in both the potential and existing vegetation, they were identified as the influence of climate changes on vegetation. The impacts of human disturbance on the vegetation distribution could be identified by the differences between the existing vegetation changes and the potential vegetation changes.</p>
