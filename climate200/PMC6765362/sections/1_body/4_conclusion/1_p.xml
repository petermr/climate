<p>The effects of human disturbance and climatic change on the distribution of global vegetation types could be separated using the proposed method. A large area of vegetation was transformed by human disturbances from no human influenced period to the period 1982–2013. About 3% of total vegetation distribution was transformed by human activities from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013. However, the influence of climate change on vegetation was limited from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013. Therefore, human disturbances caused stronger damage to global vegetation change than climate change.</p>
