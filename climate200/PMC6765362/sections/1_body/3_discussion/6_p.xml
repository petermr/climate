<p>The global existing vegetation was seriously transformed from the period 1982–1996 to the period 1997–2013. About 3% of global vegetation have changed their types in the past 30 years. Human disturbance caused stronger influences on vegetation changes than climate change, which is consistent with a study in northern forests (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Danneyrolles et al., 2019</xref>). However, the influences of climate changes on vegetation distribution could not be ignored. The regions that were influenced by both human disturbance and climate change are vulnerable to vegetation changes in the future.
