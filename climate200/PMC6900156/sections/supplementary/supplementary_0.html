  <b>Figure S1</b> Red‐backed voles ( 
  <i>Myodes rutilus</i>) instantaneous rate of change from autumn to the following spring in relation to winter maximum snow depth, 2000–2018 at Kluane Lake. There is an indication of a weak positive relationship ( 
  <i>R</i>
  <sup>
   <i>2</i>
  </sup> = 0.15, 
  <i>P</i> = 0.10. Average snow depth over winter is highly correlated with maximum snow depth ( 
  <i>r</i> = 0.82, 
  <i>n</i> = 18).

  <b>Figure S2</b> Deer mouse ( 
  <i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>) autumn population density 1976–2018 at Kluane Lake, with 95% confidence limits. No deer mice were live trapped in the forest between 1990 and 1995 in spite of extensive trapping. These data are discussed in Krebs 
  <i>et al</i>. (2018b). Figure updated from Krebs 
  <i>et al</i>. (2018b) with permission.
