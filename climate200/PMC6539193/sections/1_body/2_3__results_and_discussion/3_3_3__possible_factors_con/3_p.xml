<p>The variations in soil moisture alter the partitioning of sensible heat and latent heat loss from the surface and affect the atmospheric boundary-layer processes and regional circulation [

Therefore, other factors affecting SDTR may include precipitation and relative humidity, which would alter soil temperature by impacting heat transfer. Precipitation and SDTR had a negative relationship over the study period (correlation coefficient of –0.55;
