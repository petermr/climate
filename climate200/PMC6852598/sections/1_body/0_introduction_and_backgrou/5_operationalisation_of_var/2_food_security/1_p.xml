<p>Food security is when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for healthy and active life (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The definition of ‘food security’ was further broadened by the advent of Amartya Sen’s book 
 <italic>Poverty and Famines in 1981</italic>. Sen’s book dwells on the point that the starving are often denied access to food rather than suffering because food is unavailable and by so doing birthed the idea of entitlement to food. Sen (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) posits that starvation is the characteristic of some people not having food to eat; it is not the characteristic of there being not enough food to eat. The idea was to make a paradigm shift in the concept of food security out of the essentially agricultural domain and place it in a wider context of poverty and lack of development. This culminated in the Food and Agriculture Organisation adding the component of access to those of production and price stability.
