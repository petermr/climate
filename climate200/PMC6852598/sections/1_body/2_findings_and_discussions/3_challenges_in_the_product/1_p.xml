<p>The FAO (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) posits that production of small grains continues to suffer because it offers low yields. The FAO (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) further propounds that the low yields of small grains have acted as a major impediment for communal farmers in Zimbabweâ€™s semi-arid regions to expand and adopt production of small grains on a large scale compared to maize. The lower productivity of small grains causes farmers to neglect the production of small grains in Mangwe.
