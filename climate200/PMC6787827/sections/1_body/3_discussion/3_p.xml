<p>This study represents one of the first attempts to integrate full annual cycle dynamics into a migratory bird population simulation model (Hostetler, Sillett, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Many studies have indicated that accounting for environmental conditions on the wintering grounds and during migratory periods is important for understanding population dynamics of migratory birds (e.g., Balbontin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Drake, Rock, Quinlan, Martin, &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Sheehy, Taylor, &amp; Norris, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). For example, an analysis of long‐term monitoring data for the Canada Warbler (
 <italic>Cardellina canadensis</italic>) indicated that declining trends were associated with reduced survival during the nonbreeding period (Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and analyses of long‐term monitoring data for the American Redstart (
 <italic>Setophaga ruticilla</italic>) showed that temporal variation in wintering grounds habitat quality was a strong predictor of changes in abundance on the breeding grounds (Wilson, LaDeau, Tottrup, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Kirtland's Warbler is one of the few species with quantitative empirical models that link environmental conditions on the wintering grounds to population vital rates (Rockwell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Given the apparent high importance of wintering grounds habitat quality to long‐term population viability of Kirtland's Warbler and other migratory bird species of conservation concern (e.g., Wood Thrush [
 <italic>Hylocichla mustelina</italic>]; Rushing, Ryder, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Taylor &amp; Stutchbury, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), we encourage researchers studying migratory songbirds to focus efforts on quantifying effects of environmental conditions outside of the breeding season on population vital rates.
