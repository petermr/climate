<p>In conclusion, our study indicates the Kirtland's Warbler is stable under current environmental and management conditions, is vulnerable to climate changes on the wintering grounds, and will continue to be reliant on humans to maintain the current quantity of breeding habitat to minimize the risk of the population falling below specified management thresholds. This study represents the final component of a Kirtland's Warbler research initiative that also included assessing vulnerability to management changes under contemporary climate conditions (Brown et al.,
