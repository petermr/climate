<p>For independent effects of projected end‐of‐century changes in March precipitation, the population remained stable with the median and lower 25th percentile of projected changes, and declined with the 10th percentile of projected changes (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For the lower 25th percentile, the mean final abundance was 1,920 males, with 39.2% of simulations falling below the management target of 1,000 males (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For the 10th percentile projected change, the mean final abundance was 57 males, with 95.0% of simulations falling below the critical threshold of 200 males (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure
