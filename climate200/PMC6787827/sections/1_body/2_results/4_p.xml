<p>When quantity of breeding grounds habitat was reduced due to climate change, the population initially declined, but stabilized at ca. 1,300 males (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Similarly, when quantity of breeding grounds habitat was reduced due to management changes, the population initially declined, but stabilized at ca. 1,900 males (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). While loss of breeding grounds habitat lowered the carrying capacity, additional factors were necessary for the population to decline below the critical threshold of 200 males. The population remained stable at ca. 2,200 males when breeding grounds habitat quality was reduced due to management changes (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
