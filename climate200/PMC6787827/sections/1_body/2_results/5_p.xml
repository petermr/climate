<p>For additive effects, only three scenarios resulted in potentially stable populations based on 95% confidence intervals (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The additive scenario where the population was most likely to remain above 1,000 males included a median projected change in precipitation and reduction in breeding grounds habitat quality due to management changes, which had a mean final abundance of 2,142 males, and 13.0% of simulations fell below 1,000 males. Reducing precipitation to the lower 25th percentile of projected changes also resulted in a potentially stable population, but with 58.1% of simulations falling below 1,000 males and 0.8% falling below 200 males. The other scenario resulting in a potentially stable population included a median projected change in precipitation and reduction in breeding grounds habitat quantity due to management changes, which had a mean final abundance of 1,844 males, and 26.3% of the simulations fell below 1,000 males. Population vulnerability increased when additive models contained the lower 25th and 10th percentiles of projected end‐of‐century changes in March precipitation. For example, when the lower 10th percentile of projected changes in precipitation was added to a reduction in breeding grounds habitat quantity due to climate change, 98.1% of simulations fell below 200 males, and 9.9% went extinct (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35547-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
