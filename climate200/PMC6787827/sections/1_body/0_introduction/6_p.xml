<p>Kirtland's Warbler is a habitat specialist on the breeding grounds, largely restricted to glacial outwash plains containing well‐drained sandy soils and dominated by large stands of young, dense jack pine (
 <italic>Pinus banksiana</italic>). A recent forest vulnerability assessment concluded that the vulnerability of jack pine to climate change is high–moderate in Michigan, based on projections from several different models (i.e., Climate Change Tree Atlas, LANDIS‐II, PnET‐CN; Handler et al.,
