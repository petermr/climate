<p>On their wintering grounds, Kirtland's Warblers subsist on fruiting shrubs and arthropods (Wunderle, Currie, &amp; Ewert,

 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Empirical studies found that premigration (i.e., March) precipitation was positively correlated with subsequent fledgling production and adult annual survival (Rockwell et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) summarized end‐of‐century climate change projections for the Bahamian Archipelago, which indicated that March temperature will increase and March precipitation could decrease in the central islands that serve as the core wintering grounds habitat for Kirtland's Warblers (Cooper et al.,
