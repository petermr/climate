<p>Rapid climate changes are occurring at the global scale (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These changes have the potential to dramatically alter ecological communities through the introduction of spatially and temporally novel abiotic conditions and biotic interactions (Blois, Zarnetske, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Finnegan, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Gibson‐Reinemer, Sheldon, &amp; Rahel, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Species that undertake annual long‐distance migrations, such as Neotropical migratory songbirds, may be particularly vulnerable to rapid climate change because they rely on environmental conditions in multiple spatially discrete areas and the corridors between them (Carey, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Further, environmental conditions in one portion of the annual cycle can impact individual fitness directly or have delayed effects that carry over to other portions of the annual cycle (Paxton &amp; Moore, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Rockwell, Bocetti, &amp; Marra, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
