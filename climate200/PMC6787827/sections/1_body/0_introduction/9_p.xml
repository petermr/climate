<p>As part of the postdelisting management strategy, there is interest in modifying the plantation program to reduce planting costs and increase timber value. The Kirtland's Warbler Breeding Range Conservation Plan proposes using experimental planting techniques for up to 25% of future created habitat (e.g., reduced tree densities, changes in habitat configuration, mixed species plantations; Michigan Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish, and Wildlife Service, &amp; U. S. Forest Service,

Because current planting prescriptions are designed to maximize habitat quality for the Kirtland's Warbler, modifications will likely negatively impact both density of males and pairing success, thus affecting carrying capacity and productivity of the warbler (Bocetti,
