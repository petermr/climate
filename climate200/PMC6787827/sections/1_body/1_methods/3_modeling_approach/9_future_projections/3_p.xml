<p>To estimate potential climate change impacts on wintering grounds habitat quality, we projected proportional changes in average March precipitation in 2100 relative to baseline precipitation for the focal Bahamian islands (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35547-app-0001" ref-type="app">1</xref>). We used an ensemble of 40 GCMs, with mid‐equilibrium climate sensitivity levels and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. We used the median (−0.055), lower 25th percentile (−0.331), and lower 10th percentile (−0.558) of projected end‐of‐century changes in March precipitation based on the GCM ensemble.
