<p>For each model scenario, we projected the population for 100 years and completed 1,000 replications. To estimate long‐term population growth, we computed annual growth rates over the 100‐year simulation based on mean abundance at each time step (

To estimate the risk of extinction for model scenarios, we computed the proportion of replicates where abundance declined to 0 over the 100 years simulation period. We also computed the proportion of replications where abundance fell below 200 males, which represents the critical low abundance observed in the early 1970s, and 1,000 males, which represents the species recovery plan goal (Byelich et al.,
