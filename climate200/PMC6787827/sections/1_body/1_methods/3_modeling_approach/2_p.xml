<p>We developed a model that linked population demographics with temporally dynamic environmental conditions on the breeding and wintering grounds, using the program STELLA Professional (version 1.7.1; isee systems). STELLA is a dynamic systems modeling program that is capable of handling complex model structures, such as subtime steps (e.g., seasons within years), variable time step lengths, and feedback loops (e.g., Rodenhouse,
