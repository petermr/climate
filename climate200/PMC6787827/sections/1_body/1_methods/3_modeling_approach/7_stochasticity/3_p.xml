<p>For wintering grounds precipitation, we obtained total March precipitation recorded at the Nassau NOAA weather station from 1994 to 2013. We removed the upper 10% of observation years from the data set because they represented low‐frequency extreme precipitation years (e.g., 21.02 cm recorded in 2001). We acknowledge that extreme precipitation years likely influence population vital rates, but currently there are no data to infer the magnitude, or even direction, of these relationships. For the projection models, annual wintering grounds precipitation was drawn from a Gaussian distribution parameterized using the empirical mean and standard deviation, with the lower tail bounded at 0. In addition to environmental stochasticity, we incorporated demographic stochasticity in adult and hatch‐year annual survivorship by drawing values from a binomial distribution that was parameterized using initial abundance and model‐predicted (adult) or specified (hatch‐year) mean annual survival (Akçakaya,
