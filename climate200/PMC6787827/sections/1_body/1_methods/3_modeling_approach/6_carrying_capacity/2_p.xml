<p>Annual carrying capacity on the breeding grounds is dependent on both quantity and quality of breeding habitat. Habitat quality, a function of stand density and age, influences density of Kirtland's Warblers (Bocetti,

 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). The Kirtland's Warbler Conservation Team defined 14,593 ha as the target for annual breeding habitat availability (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and we used this as our baseline annual breeding habitat quantity. To obtain annual breeding grounds carrying capacity, we multiplied quantity of breeding habitat by mean density, which we simulated using a Gaussian distribution based on empirical data from 2004 to 2017 (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35547-app-0001" ref-type="app">1</xref>). Thus, the model accounted for annual variability in mean quality of habitat, reflected in changes in mean density. We assumed ceiling‐type density dependence, which allows populations to grow exponentially until they reach carrying capacity (Akçakaya et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). When the population exceeded the carrying capacity, reproduction was restricted to the carrying capacity, with the remaining individuals allowed to survive, but not reproduce. Thus, the population could exceed the model carrying capacity, but at the cost of reduced per capita productivity.
