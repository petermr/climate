<p>Adult male annual survival was modeled as a function of wintering grounds habitat quality, using model estimates from an empirical study that found total March precipitation recorded at the Nassau National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather station in the Bahamas in breeding year X was a strong predictor of survival probability to breeding year X + 1 (Rockwell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Specifically, we used the estimated parameters for a model that included mean annual survival as a function of March precipitation. For this model, baseline adult male annual survival was 0.4544 and increased by 0.0395 with every 1 cm increase in precipitation. We bounded maximum annual survival by the highest empirical estimate of 0.75 (Probst,

Currently, there are no quantitative data linking wintering grounds habitat quality to hatch‐year survival, and thus, we used a constant value of 0.35, representing estimated average hatch‐year survival under current environmental conditions (Rockwell et al.,
