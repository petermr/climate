<p>Our breeding grounds study area consisted of designated essential Kirtland's Warbler breeding habitat on federal and state lands in the LP of Michigan, USA (Kirtland's Warbler Management Areas [KWMAs]; Byelich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35547-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This region is the core breeding habitat for the species and contains &gt;95% of all breeding individuals (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In addition, nearly all demographic data for the Kirtland's Warbler has come from this region. Additional currently occupied breeding areas (i.e., additional private lands in the LP, Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Probst, Donner, Bocetti, &amp; Sjogren, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), Wisconsin (Anich, Trick, Grveles, &amp; Goyette, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), and Ontario (Richard, 
 <xref rid="ece35547-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>)) were not included because the majority of these lands are not managed specifically for Kirtland's Warbler and long‐term habitat availability is unpredictable. Thus, our estimated available breeding habitat was slightly conservative with respect to range‐wide breeding patch occupancy, but realistic given expected consistent long‐term habitat availability. Our wintering grounds study area included Cat, Eleuthera, Long, and San Salvador islands, the four Bahamian islands with the highest densities of Kirtland's Warblers based on current monitoring data (Cooper, Ewert, Wunderle, Helmer, &amp; Marra,
