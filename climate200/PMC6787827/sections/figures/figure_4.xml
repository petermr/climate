  <p>Deterministic simulations of abundance of male Kirtland's Warblers (
   <italic>Setophaga kirtlandii</italic>) from 2001–2012 using a model that only incorporated dynamic environmental conditions on the breeding grounds (Breeding Grounds‐only; solid black line), and a model that incorporated dynamic environmental conditions on the breeding grounds and temporal variation in wintering grounds habitat quality (Dynamic Wintering Grounds; solid gray line). For the Dynamic Wintering Grounds model, we used observed total March precipitation from 2004–2012, and mean precipitation from the projection model (i.e., 3.42 cm) for 2001–2003 due to these being extreme precipitation years, for which the relationships between precipitation and population vital rates are unknown. Observed abundances represent the total counts in Michigan from annual Kirtland's Warbler breeding male censuses (black dotted line)
