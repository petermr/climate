 <caption> Focal Kirtland's Warbler ( Setophaga kirtlandii) breeding grounds and wintering grounds habitat included in this study assessing vulnerability of the species to potential future changes in environmental and management conditions. The breeding grounds included designated essential breeding habitat on federal and state lands in the Lower Peninsula (LP) of Michigan, USA, which serves as the core breeding habitat for the species and contains &gt;95% of all breeding individuals. The wintering grounds included the four Bahamian islands with the highest abundances of Kirtland's Warblers based on current monitoring data (i.e., Cat, Eleuthera, Long, and San Salvador).
