 <p>We sought to quantify the vulnerability of the rare Neotropical migratory songbird Kirtland's Warbler to projected environmental changes on the breeding and wintering grounds. We simulated independent and additive effects of reduced breeding grounds habitat quantity and quality, and wintering grounds habitat quality, on population viability. Projected large reductions in wintering grounds precipitation caused the population to decline, with risk of extinction magnified when breeding habitat quantity or quality also decreased.
