<p>Ticks, another disease-transmitting vector, is found to be greatly affected by global warming in terms of survival and reproduction rates largely due to increase in winter temperatures [

 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. From 1990 to 2008, tickâ€™s coverage area expanded almost twice i.e., from 12.5% to 26.8% with major expansion occurring in the northern region. A different study conducted in Russia reported a significant rise in the population of

 <xref rid="B95-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. These studies highlighted that the expansions were mainly due to milder winters and extended spring and autumn seasons along with some adverse human activities such as decimation of forest and over exploitation of coal and petroleum reserves, which ultimately promote global warming.
