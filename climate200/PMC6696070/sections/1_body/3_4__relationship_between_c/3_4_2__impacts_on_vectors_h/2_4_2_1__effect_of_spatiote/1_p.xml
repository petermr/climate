<p>Temperature rise can lead to a major shift in the habitats of vectors. Vectors living in lower latitude regions can shift their habitat to mid or high latitudes, resulting in geographical amplification of vectors and related diseases. Vector-borne diseases such as lyme, malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and plague are some of the examples with wide geographical expansion in many parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, snail (
 <italic>Oncomelania hupensis</italic>) as a vector plays a vital role in the transmission of Schistosomiasis. A study conducted in China found that owing to a continuous rise in winter temperature, 
 <italic>O. hupensis</italic> increased its range with widespread distribution, thereby spreading schistosomiasis over northern China [

 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The consequences of the high rate of warming in these regions were found in terms of spatiotemporal distribution of vector-borne diseases. Firstly, malaria which was confined to the forest and nearby areas of Terai, around 38 districts in Nepal lowlands, has now expanded to mountains covering around 65 districts of Nepal [

 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In total, 44 species of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes were estimated to be affected and among them 7 (i.e., 
 <italic>Anopheles fluviatilis, An. dravidicus, An. willmori, An. minimus, An. pseudowillmori, An. maculatus, and An. annularis</italic>) were responsible for the transmission of malaria. Similar trends were also observed for dengue [

 <xref rid="B91-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. One more vector-borne disease, Japanese encephalitis transmitted by mosquito species 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchushas,</italic> rose northwards in India and became an endemic in Nepal [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Initially reported in 24 districts of the lowland Terai, Japanese encephalitis was transmitted to other mountain regions including Kathmandu [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lastly, visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis were other vector-borne diseases whose spatiotemporal distribution were reported due to global warming [
