<p>Climate change can also alter the probability of disease transmission by increasing human-vector and human-pathogens contact. This can be well understood with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species bloodmeal digestion patterns, which change with temperature. The quicker this species digests their bloodmeal, the more opportunity they will have to search for and hence increase chances of transmission [
 <xref rid="B112-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. For example, at 8 °C, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae develop in 38 days, whereas at 12 °C, they last only for 18-20 days; bloodmeal digestion generally takes 30 days at 4 °C and just 5 days at 20 °C; in the case of embryonic developments, it takes 42 days at 4 °C whereas only 22 days at 12 °C and just 8 days at 20 °C [

 <xref rid="B113-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Sandfly, another vector which can transmit leishmaniasis, an infection caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. Temperature greatly manipulates the biting activity and maturation of 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> in infected sandfly [
 <xref rid="B114-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. It was found that the biting behavior of sandfly is more common in summer seasons, although too hot and dry conditions can be detrimental for sand flies. Campylobacteriosis, a bacterial gastrointestinal disease is stimulated by thermophilic 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. bacteria. Researchers found that broiler and poultry meat were major infection transmission sources [
 <xref rid="B115-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Further study also revealed that the colonization of campylobacter, along with those meats, have an exponential relationship with rising temperature [
