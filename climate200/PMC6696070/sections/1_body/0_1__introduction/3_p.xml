<p>The inter-relationship amidst contagious pathogenic activities, vectors’ susceptibility, and climatic variations have been a topic of great interest. As an example, any modulating factor that prolongs the ‘stochastic trends of disease transmission’ also permit pathogens to acclimate to the intermediate host and aggrandize disease evolution [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02799" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Being an inherent module of this rubric, climate change act as a background context and if changed, affects the susceptibility and transmission of infectious diseases. This research put forward a systematic literature review covering numerous scientific evidences, which highlight the effects of climate change and weather events on human-based diseases. Precisely, the present study provides a reconnaissance for the scrutinized and predicted impacts of climate change and weather events over disease-causing pathogens and vectors. The research also underlines the need for future studies by discussing the voids in research progress, productive policies and human adaptation.
