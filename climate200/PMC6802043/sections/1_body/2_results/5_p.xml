 <sup>2</sup> = 0.12). IUCN categories of extinction risk, clutch size, and altitude midpoint (only for UKMO) were the main predictors of differences in species' range shifts (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35617-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The higher the risk of extinction the greater the reduction in range size under both CCSM3 and CSIRO climate models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35617-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,c). Further, species with larger clutch size tended to have lower reduction in range size under both CCSM3 and CSIRO (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35617-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b,d). Using UKMO, species occurring at higher altitudinal midpoint, extinction risk, and with larger clutch size had a lower reduction in range size (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35617-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
