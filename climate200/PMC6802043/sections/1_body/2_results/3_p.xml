<p>Another ca. 50% of species neither decreased nor increased their projected geographic range size (CCSM3 = 663 species; CSIRO = 668 species; UKMO = 547 species). Only a small fraction of species was projected to increase its geographic range size (CCSM3 = 33 species; CSIRO = 28 species; UKMO = 30 species), with mean increase of 344.8% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 551.6%), 359.8% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 587.4%), and 494.1% (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 788.1%) of the current area under CCSM3, CSIRO, and UKMO, respectively. Across all AOGCM, large range shifts tended to be less precise, showing wider confidence intervals (Figure
