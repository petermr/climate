<p>Different issues arise when applying formal meta‐analytic techniques to summarize niche modeling results, but critical is the uncertainty associated with range shift estimates. For example, Diniz‐Filho et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) showed that the estimated shifts in species' geographic ranges varied broadly, mainly due to the use of different Ecological Niche Models (ENMs hereafter). Other sources of uncertainty include the choices of AOGCM, GES, parameterization methods and rules to transform continuous outputs of models into presence and absence estimates (Nenzén &amp; Araújo, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In other words, different model projections are obtained when different combinations of ENMs, GES, and AOGCMs are used. Furthermore, the characteristics of the modeled organisms (e.g., life history and dispersal ability) can also influence model outcomes (Buisson, Thuiller, Casajus, Lek, &amp; Grenouillet,
