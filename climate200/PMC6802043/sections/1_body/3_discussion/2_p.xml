<p>We examined the potential effects of projected climate change on the geographic range sizes of Neotropical birds. Matching results obtained by many studies (Parmesan &amp; Yohe,

 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2006</xref> for a comprehensive review), which measured phenological (e.g., advancement of spring events) and distributional changes (e.g., poleward shifts in geographical ranges, range contractions or expansions), we projected that effects of climate change on the range sizes of Neotropical birds can be negative. The negative sign of this forecasted pattern seems to be coherent (sensu Parmesan,

 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) for the scale of the Neotropics. Further, we showed that more than 80% of the observed variance in species‐range size change can be attributable to real differences between species and, therefore, can potentially be explained by species‐levels (explanatory) variables. However, finding correlates of range shift proved to be difficult.
