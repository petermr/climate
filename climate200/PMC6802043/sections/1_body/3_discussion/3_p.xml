<p>Even under the unrealistic assumption of unlimited dispersal (which favors the hypothesis of no effect of climate change on the biota), we found that 509 (for CCSM3 and CSIRO) to 628 species (for UKMO) from all 1,205 bird species assessed are projected to experience range contraction. Further, species that were projected to lose less or even to increase their range of occurrence tended to present the most imprecise estimates. Our estimates of the relative number of bird species suffering more than 50% range contractions (4.4%, 3.7% and 27.8% of all bird species considered, respectively for CCSM3, CSIRO, and UKMO) are also comparable to those made by Jetz et al. (
