<p>Third, the weighted mean range shift (
 <italic>M</italic>), summarizing the results across the 1,205 bird species, was estimated assuming a random‐effects model, where the weight (
 <italic>W
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) assigned to each species 
 <italic>i</italic> was given by the reciprocal of the 
 <italic>V
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> plus the between‐species variance (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>). In a typical meta‐analysis, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> is an estimate of the between‐studies variance in effect sizes (see Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &amp; Rothstein, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Borenstein, Higgins, Hedges, &amp; Rothstein, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In our study, this statistic reflects the variability among the species in terms of their likely responses to climate change (difference between current and future potential geographic distribution). Thus, the larger the variance (
 <italic>V
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>) associated to a 
 <italic>D
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>, which, in our study, is due to the use of different ENMs, the smaller the weight of a species in estimating 
 <italic>M</italic>. The larger the between‐species variance (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>), the larger our uncertainty over 
 <italic>M</italic>.
