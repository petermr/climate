<p>We used a subset of the species (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,205) modeled by Diniz‐Filho et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) because we kept only those for which the following variables were available (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece35617-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>): altitude midpoint, body size, IUCN categories of extinction risk, clutch size, and migratory behavior (migrants or non‐migrants). A previous study indicated that these traits are important in predicting bird extinction risk (Machado &amp; Loyola, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Altitude midpoint was defined as the mean between maximum and minimum altitude within ranges. Data on body size, clutch size, and migratory behavior came from different sources (see Machado &amp; Loyola, 
 <xref rid="ece35617-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). IUCN categories of extinction risk were transformed to a discrete scale attributing zero, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to least concern (LC), near‐threatened species (NT), vulnerable species (VU), endangered species (EN), and critically endangered species (CR), respectively (Cardillo et al.,
