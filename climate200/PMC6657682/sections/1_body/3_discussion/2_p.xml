<p>Microendemic plants are not evenly distributed across Brazil; they seem to be concentrated in relatively small watersheds where the combination of topography, climate, and soil favors both the generation and the accumulation of endemic species over time. This pattern is similar to the ones reported in other countries with high numbers of narrowly distributed species (
