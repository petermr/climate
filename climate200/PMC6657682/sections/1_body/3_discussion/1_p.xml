<p>According to the land-use scenario, the number of microendemics threatened by habitat loss, climate change, or by both factors in Brazil is between 2.86 and 3.68 times higher than the number of Brazilian plant species classified as threatened (558) by the IUCN global plant assessment (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">IUCN, 2019</xref>) but comparable (1.32 and 1.02 times smaller) to the total number of seed plant species classified as threatened (2,113) on the official Brazilian Red List (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, 2014</xref>). Although the number of high-extinction risk species is smaller than the number of species on the official Brazilian Red List, these two lists show a thin overlap (c. 8%), suggesting that current conservation assessments, both at national and global levels, underestimate the actual number of plants at extinction risk by a high margin. Moreover, our findings fit well with studies in other regions of the world, demonstrating that species with narrow distributions have not had their extinction risk adequately assessed by traditional conservation assessments (
