<p>Restricted-range species are not distributed evenly across continents. Instead, they are clustered around some specific areas (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Kruckeberg &amp; Rabinowitz, 1985</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Pimm et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Caesar, Grandcolas &amp; Pellens, 2017</xref>). Such areas are unique (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Crother &amp; Murray, 2011</xref>) and, from a conservation perspective, are irreplaceable and consequently top priorities for conservation actions (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Pressey, Johnson &amp; Wilson, 1994</xref>). Species have narrow distributions either because they originated in small areas and have not expanded since then or because their ranges contracted in response to past environmental changes (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Hobohm, 2013</xref>). Hence, areas with such endemics, besides high conservation value, are also relevant from an evolutionary perspective because they are both centers of origin for young species (cradles) and centers of survival for old species (museums) (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Kier et al., 2009</xref>).
