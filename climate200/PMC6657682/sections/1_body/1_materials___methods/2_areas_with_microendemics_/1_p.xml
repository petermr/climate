<p>We classified each area with microendemics in phytogeographic domains (hereafter domains) by using Brazilâ€™s domain (= biomes) map produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) at a 1:1,000,000 scale (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">IBGE, 2004</xref>) as a background, with a few changes in the boundaries of the Caatinga domain (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Silva, Leal &amp; Tabarelli, 2017</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). We used the centroid of each area with microendemics to classify it in one of the six Brazilian major domains: Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and Pampa.
