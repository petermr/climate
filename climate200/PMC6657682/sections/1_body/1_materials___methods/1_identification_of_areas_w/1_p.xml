<p>We evaluated the distribution of 3,272 species of seed plants that are endemic to Brazil with a range smaller than 10,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>. This list of species was primarily based on the country’s catalogue of rare plant species in Brazil (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Giulietti et al., 2009</xref>). To complement and update it, we assessed the range of virtually all species of seed plants (except the orchids) that have been described as endemic to Brazil since 2008 according to the International Plant Name Index (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ipni.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ipni.org</ext-link>) and checked their taxonomy and distribution with information available on the Flora of Brazil 2020 website (

 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, 2014</xref>). We did not assess Orchidaceae (350 species) because a preliminary evaluation showed that original publications or accurate data of occurrence were not available for many species of the family, and 40% of them were not yet on the Flora of Brazil 2020 list. The records of all 3,272 species were georeferenced and validated by checking locations with topographic maps and gazetteers. Imprecise locality data were discarded, and the species’ ranges were corrected as necessary.
