<p>The RCCI is based on four variables that were calculated separately for austral summer and winter seasons: a change of near-surface air temperature in relation to the global average, a change in regional precipitation, and a change in the interannual variability of both temperature and precipitation (
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Torres &amp; Marengo, 2013</xref>). The climate variables and statistics were computed as follows: (a) a change in climate variables was calculated for each model simulation, (b) the ensemble averages over different available models were computed, and (c) the two different forcing scenarios were averaged (

Using this index as raster dataset input and the areas with microendemics as the zones of interest, the zonal statistics tool in ArcGIS was applied to compute the average RCCI for each area with microendemics.
