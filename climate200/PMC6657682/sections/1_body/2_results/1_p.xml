<p>We identified 776 areas in Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>) that are home of 2,354 microendemic species of seed plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S1</xref>). These areas with microendemics range from 9.1 km
 <sup>2</sup> to 24,885 km
 <sup>2</sup> (median =898.3 km
 <sup>2</sup>, lower quartile =297.9 km
 <sup>2</sup>, upper quartile = 2,183 km
 <sup>2</sup>) and, together, cover 1,491,445 km
 <sup>2</sup> or 17.5% of Brazil. They are found in all six Brazilian domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>), but most of them (39%) are in the Atlantic Forest. Each area shelters between one and 126 microendemics, but most of them (59%) have only one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The areas with the highest number of microendemics are mainly found along the central Atlantic Forest and the high plateaus in Cerrado and Caatinga (
