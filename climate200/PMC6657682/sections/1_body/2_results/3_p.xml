<p>The proportion of microendemic species in each one of the four risk classes also varies across domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). In all three scenarios, habitat loss is the primary factor threatening microendemics in the Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, and Pampa. In the Amazon and Cerrado, climate change is the primary factor threatening microendemics in scenario 1, but the combination of climate change and habitat loss is the primary threat driver in scenarios 2 and 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). In Pantanal, the species under risk are mainly affected by the combination of habitat loss and climate change. In scenario 1, the number of species under risk is higher than the number of species with low risk, except in Caatinga and Pampa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, in scenarios 2 and 3, the number of species under risk is always higher than the number of species with low risk across all domains (
