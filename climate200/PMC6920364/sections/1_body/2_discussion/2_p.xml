<p id="Par29">As shown in a case study involving the Republic of Korea, coastal regions tend to have more severe weather events and more barren areas undeveloped in a natural state or unimproved by forced displacement and planned relocation, as compared to inland regions. On the other hand, most of the densely populated and developed areas along the coastlines have adequately adapted or coped with flooding in the study site. In light of such circumstances, a multiplicative composite indicator

 <sub>2</sub> can be suggested to be more appropriate for measuring the flood vulnerability in the coastal areas under study, given that districts where all of the assessment components are more vulnerable can have higher vulnerability than the ones being compensated for by any larger component. Table

 <sub>2</sub>, as compared to ranking orders by other five flood vulnerability indicators, along with the two selected administrative districts that show extreme fluctuations in ranking orders across different flood vulnerability outcomes in the study site. Although it might be difficult to validate the assessment outcomes of the flood vulnerability to future climate change, the historical flood damage data are collected from the National Disaster Information Center
