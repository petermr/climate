<p id="Par2">Climate change is one of the greatest environmental threats, already having visible impacts on all countries worldwide; thus, vulnerability assessment to climate change has become one of the most important tools for providing fundamental information on mitigation and adaptation measures concerning climate variability, changes, and impacts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. One of the most outstanding definitions and frameworks for vulnerability assessment to climate change is discussed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report (IPCC TAR)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>, which states that the vulnerability assessment components are exposure, sensitivity (also fragility or susceptibility), and coping (also response capacity, adaptive capacity, or resilience). This has also been described in some selected literature, including the IPCC Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. As climate change has a large impact on many sectors important to society and the environment, this conceptual framework for vulnerability to climate change has been used in various vulnerability assessments for the purpose of targeting multi-dimensional issues in a wide range of fields

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. In particular, many coastal areas have already experienced severe weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rains, and huge storm surges, due to climate change, causing devastating flooding in low-lying areas of coastal regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, it is necessary to develop flood damage mitigation strategies in coastal regions through an appropriate assessment of flood vulnerability that indicates a degree of potential damage at flood risk.
