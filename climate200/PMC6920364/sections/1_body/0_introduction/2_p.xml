<p id="Par3">Vulnerability to climate change has been evaluated mainly with a composite indicator compiled from multiple assessment components by one of the various aggregation frameworks and methods

 </sup>. A single composite indicator is usually compiled from individual component indicators to measure the multidimensional concept
 <sup>

 </sup>, as multiple-criteria decision making or analysis is required to evaluate multidimensional issues and multiple conflicting criteria in decision making

 </sup>. Hence, multi-attribute utility functions are most commonly and powerfully used to combine assessment attribute components into a composite indicator for the overall performance information that can provide ranked alternatives for deterministic policy and decision problems
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>. The general procedure for constructing a composite indicator for policy and decision making is as follows:

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup> 1) a theoretical framework is established to select and classify appropriate assessment components that fulfill the purpose of generating a meaningful composite indicator; 2) proxy variables relevant to individual components are selected and identified by multivariate analysis in the context of availability, measurability, representatives, soundness, and mutual independence; 3) a selected normalization method transforms variables measured at different units or scales into a common domain to affect the analysis in an equal scale; 4) reasonable weightings are estimated and assigned for the importance of the associated variable based on correlations between variables and the phenomena; 5) a multi-attribute utility function is employed to aggregate individual attribute components into a composite indicator to measure overall performance; and 6) sensitivity and robustness analysis is conducted to prevent the derived composite indicator from providing false or misleading information.
