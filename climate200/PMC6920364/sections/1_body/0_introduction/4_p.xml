<p id="Par5">The aim of this study is to evaluate various kinds of composite indicator products for assessing vulnerability to climate change. It uses different conventional aggregation frameworks to better understand the importance of composite indicators used in decision making for selecting alternatives or a preferred solution. Therefore, for evaluating the various composite indicators, this study investigates how frameworks of assessment components and multi-attribute utility forms for combining them affect the vulnerability composite indicator outcomes to estimate the overall performance. This study considers that all the attribute components are normalized into a commensurate scale from 1 to 100, indicating the least to most preferred, and weighted equally to individual components in order to avoid any other effects of normalization and weightings on composite indicator outcomes. It is feasible to assign equal weights to all assessment indicators in the absence of information or consensus for different weights

 </sup>. The comparative analysis has focused on the vulnerability ranking fluctuations across the six composite indicators by the conventional aggregation frameworks to facilitate the understanding of the interaction among the constituent components and assessment outcomes with respect to various multi-attribute utility forms. The analysis is illustrated by tackling the possible reference cases for combinations of the vulnerability attribute components and by a case study based on actual observations and data in multidimensional situations for the coastal flood vulnerability assessment to climate change in the Republic of Korea.
