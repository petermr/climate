<p id="Par17">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> denote the comparison of the vulnerability indicator scores 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> aggregated from the three components, exposure, sensitivity, and lack of coping, with 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> aggregated from the two components, potential impact (combined from exposure and sensitivity) and lack of coping. The framework comprising the two components with more weighted lack of coping can lead to different vulnerability ranking than that of results combined when the three components are equally weighted. The vulnerability indicators 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> can be more sensitive to the lack of coping component weighted at one-half of the exposure and sensitivity components with one-quarter weight for each, given the equal weights of 1/2 as denoted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Except cases (1), (6), and (18) with the triplet score levels for the three components, almost all other reference cases show differences in ranking orders between 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> by additive aggregations and between 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> by multiplicative aggregations. As for the perspective of the lack of coping scores, the vulnerability ranking of 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> is higher in cases (5), (8), (10), and (14) with the high level scores of lack of coping, while lower in cases (7), (11), (12), (15), and (16) with the low level scores of lack of coping, compared with that of 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.
