<p id="Par21">Due to the lack of data on hydrological modelling for the entire study site, for the geographical range exposed to hazards, the exposure component comprises flood-causing climatic variations in coastal regions, such as the rainfall and storm surge data. Aside from heavy rainfall being the main cause of flooding, storm surge is one of the most dangerous perturbations causing flooding in coastal areas, since it can cause a significant rise in sea level. The future daily rainfall data by climate change based on the IPCC AR5 scenario are collected from the Korea Meteorological Administration Global Atmosphere Watch

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the spatial distribution of the six proxy variables in the study site. Overall, the exposure components E1 and E2 are higher in the southern and western parts, with relatively severe climates in low terrains, while sensitivity components S1 and S2 are higher in the north-western and south-eastern parts around metropolitan areas. For the coping components, many districts show the contrary values with lower C1 and higher C2 in general.
