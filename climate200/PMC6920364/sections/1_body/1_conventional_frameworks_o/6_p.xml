<p id="Par11">As summarized in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the vulnerability to climate change has usually been estimated using one of the six measures from

 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and 
 <italic>VA</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> by additive aggregations, and

 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <italic>VM</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, and

 <sub>3</sub> by multiplicative aggregations. Therefore, the influence of the six multi-attribute utility forms required for a composite indicator on measuring vulnerability is comprehensively examined as follows.
