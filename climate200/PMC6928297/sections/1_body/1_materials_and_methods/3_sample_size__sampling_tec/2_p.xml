 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Krejcie and Morgan's (1970)</xref> statistical table for sample size selection, 378 respondents in 15 communities, were randomly selected from a target population of 17,696 agriculture households in the district. In addition, 41 key informants were purposively selected for interviews. The key informants included 15 district agriculture officers and 26 smallholder farmers. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for key informants included years of farming experience, length of stay in the district, knowledge of climate change and willingness to participate in the study. Questionnaire survey and semi structured interview guide were the main data collection instruments. The questionnaire aided in the collection of quantitative data while the interviews collected qualitative data which aided in a deeper understanding of the perception and experiences of smallholder farmers in their natural setting.
