<p id="p0145">An Agricultural Officer recounted on ordeal of high temperature observed in the district. According to the Officer (DDO4): “
 <italic>There is also hot temperature in the Adansi North District particularly in February and March and this leads to rainfall in the subsequent months. Even in March and April where we receive some rainfall, we still experience high temperature. The high temperature intensifies in May due to the cessation of rainfall. There has also been a change in the duration of temperature in the district. The sun rises very early with high temperature early in the morning. At first, high temperature was observed from midday to about 15 h GMT but it is not so this time around. We experience very hot sun as early as 8 h GMT. The length of sunshine in a day has increased with corresponding high temperature”.</italic> The changes in duration and intensity of temperature have been well documented in the literature, both in Ghana and elsewhere (
