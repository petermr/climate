 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, smallholder farmers’ experiences of climate change are presented. The majority of the farmers have experienced late onset and early cessation of rainfall in the district as reported by 82.8% and 89.2% of respondents, respectively. Previous studies have reported that smallholder famers in Ghana have observed early cessation and late onset of rainfall (

The observed changes in climate have affected the predictability of rainfall by smallholder farmers, who require such information for their agricultural activities. A vast majority of the smallholder farmers (94.7%) have also experienced decrease in the duration of rainfall while about 82.5% of the farmers have observed an increase in rainfall intensity. Unpredictability of rainfall by smallholder farmers and decrease in rainfall duration have been reported in existing literature (
