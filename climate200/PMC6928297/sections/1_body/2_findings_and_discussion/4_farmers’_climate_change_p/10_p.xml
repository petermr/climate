 <italic>I can say that the pattern of rainfall in the district is biennial. We receive good rainfall every two years. I have been here for the past six years and there are years that rainfall onset was very early with high intensity and in such years it rains a lot throughout the year. There are other years too that rainfall onset is delayed and it rains for a short period, as rainfall retreats very early. In most cases, when the onset is delayed with early cessation, we mostly receive rainfall once in a while when approaching September and October</italic>”
