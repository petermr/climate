<p id="p0150">The change in temperature in the district slightly differs from community to community. The difference could be explained by the influence of hills and highlands in the district. A Development Officer stated that “
 <italic>Fomena, which is the district capital is situated on a hill and therefore it rains a lot there, hence the temperature is not so high in Fomena. However, if you go to those communities that are not situated on highlands, you will observe that the sun shines very much in these areas, leading to high temperature</italic>” (DDO3)
 <italic>.</italic> Previous studies noted that orographic features influence variability in climate (

 <italic>the district experiences very high temperature. Even though we do not have data on that but we have observed through our farming and environmental activities that the temperature is very high these days</italic>” (DDO4)
 <italic>.</italic> From above, it is indicative that the Adansi North District has experienced changes in temperature, particularly rise in intensity and increase in duration of temperature. The findings from the qualitative data agree with that of the quantitative data, which showed a rise in temperature.
