According to a household head “we used to start the farming season soon after Christmas some years ago but currently we cannot do that since we need to wait until the rain sets in from March or April” (HH5). Another household head expressed that “
 <italic>for the past years, the rain started from January, but was not massive. From then, farmers prepare their lands for farming till June-July. However, in recent times and especially in 2018, the rain started very late and was massive</italic>” (HH13). This is consistent with previous studies which showed delay in rainfall season (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Limantol et al., 2016</xref>). The delay in rainfall causes a delay in farming activities, as the major and minor rainfall seasons reinforce the major and minor farming seasons in the district (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">MOFA, 2016</xref>). The participants have also observed changes in rainfall season in the district. “
 <italic>Previously, the major raining season peaked in June, July but now we even receive massive rains in April and May</italic>” (HH13)
 <italic>.</italic> As such, farmers are no longer able to predict rainfall season due to climate change. The majority of participants raised concerns on unpredictability of rainfall due to climate change. For instance, a household head recounted that “
 <italic>at first, we could predict the month in which the rainy season will start and plan our farming activities accordingly, but now climate change has resulted in changes in rainfall season, thereby making it difficult for us to predict. Our fathers and our forefathers had ideas as to when to plant and when not to plant, which enabled them to plan their activities. Nowadays, when you expect rainfall you do not get it and when you do not expect rainfall, it rains. Sometimes too, it rains shortly for a season</italic>” (HH1)
