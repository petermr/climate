<p id="p0180">The study computed independent-sample t-test and one-way ANOVA to compare how the differences in demographic characteristics of smallholder farmers influence their perception (see 
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">TableÂ 7</xref>). The results showed that there is no significant relationship between demographic characteristics of smallholder farmers and their climate change perception. For instance, in the case of gender, there was no significant difference in the perceptions of males (
 <italic>M</italic> = 15.67, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 2.66) and female (
 <italic>M</italic> = 15.83, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 2.56), 
 <italic>t</italic> (376) = 0.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.566. Even though, female farmers were slightly positive on their perception of climate change than male farmers, there was a small magnitude in the mean differences of males and females (eta squared = 0.009). The results also showed that there was not significant effect of age [
 <italic>F</italic> (5, 372) = 0.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.821], education [
 <italic>F</italic> (5, 372) = 0.39, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.859] and years of farming experience [
 <italic>F</italic> (6, 371) = 0.78, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.590] on perception.
