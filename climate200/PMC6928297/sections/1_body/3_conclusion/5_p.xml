<p id="p0210">As climate change perception influences the choice of adaptation of smallholder farmers (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Fadina and Barjolle, 2018</xref>), the study recommends that climate change education and mass awareness should be intensified particularly in rural communities where misconception is high and farmers have limited capacity to adapt to climate change. To do this, all available media particularly television, radio, extension agents and community information centers, which have gained roots in rural communities should be used. In addition, climate journalism which provides accurate and reliable climate information should be promoted. This will help to increase access to reliable and accurate climate information needed by smallholder farmers for their agricultural activities, as 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hirons et al. (2018)</xref> found that smallholder farmers in cocoa growing communities in Ghana have challenges in accessing reliable climate information. The study again recommends that the number of meteorological stations should be increased and extended to every district in Ghana. While such approach will boost access to reliable climate information to smallholder farmers, it will equally enhance fit-for-purpose climate change policies at the local level, which is essential for agricultural-based district development agenda. Access to essential resources and capacity development programmes should be intensified particularly in rural communities to increase farmers’ adaptive capacity.
