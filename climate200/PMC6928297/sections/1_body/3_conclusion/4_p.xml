<p id="p0205">Another conclusion drawn from the study is that climate change experiences of smallholder farmers and district agriculture officers confirmed the results from meteorological data. As such, we argue that the changes in climate in the Adansi North District are fairly represented by regional climate data, although there was no significant relationship between the lived climate change experiences/perception of smallholder farmers' and regional meteorological data. Therefore, the changes in climate occurring in the Adansi North District are not anyway different from the changes observed in the Ashanti region. The study also found no significant differences in demographic characteristics of smallholder farmers and their perception. Nevertheless, information from family and friends and government, particularly, local institutions and extension service were significant predictors of perception. In addition, information from the media such as television and radio significantly influence farmersâ€™ perception. By this, we conclude that information from family and friends, government and the media particularly television and radio shape climate change perception of smallholder farmers.</p>
