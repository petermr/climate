<p id="p0200">It is conclusive from the study that the Adansi North District has observed changes in climate. The findings from the analysis of meteorological data showed that indeed, there have been remarkable changes in climate, marked by rising temperature and rainfall, even though rainfall and temperature trends were oscillatory. Similarly, the smallholder farmers perceived that there have been changes in climate particularly in rainfall, temperature and windstorm. The farmers reported that they have observed late onset and early cessation of rainfall accompanied by reduction in duration of rainfall and an increase in its intensity. For temperature, the farmers have observed rising temperature and the associated increasing intensity and duration of temperature. The lived experiences of both farmers and district agriculture officers confirmed the changes in rainfall and temperature in addition to destructive windstorm.</p>
