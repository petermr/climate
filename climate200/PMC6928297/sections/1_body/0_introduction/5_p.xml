<p id="p0025">Nevertheless, smallholder farmers in Africa in general and Ghana in particular face challenges in accessing reliable and accurate climate information (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hirons et al., 2018</xref>), needed for adaptation and meteorological disaster preparedness. The lack of access to climate data for agricultural activities increases vulnerability and exposes farmers to the adverse impact of climate change, thereby creating the urgent need to disseminate reliable and accurate climate information to already vulnerable smallholder farmers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) asserts that future impact of climate change will likely be high in vulnerable societies particularly in Africa (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2018</xref>). This is problematic as climate change will disrupt the agriculture system in Africa and affect food security and livelihood of smallholder farmers. Hence, addressing the menace of climate change through adaptation and mitigation is paramount in development policies and programmes in Africa. However, the success of adaptation and mitigation depends to a large extent on the successful understanding of climate change, which requires a deeper understanding of the values of climate parameters and the corresponding extreme weather events as well as how smallholder farmers who are highly vulnerable to climate change understand and perceive these changes (
