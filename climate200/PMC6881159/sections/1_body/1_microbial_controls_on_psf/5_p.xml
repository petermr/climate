<p>Key microbial processes involved in potential change of PSFs are context dependent and differ across ecosystems and with the plant species involved. However, some generalities are beginning to emerge that could help enhance our capacity to predict PSFs and vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems (

 </xref>) and reveal the importance of plant traits, especially those related to nutrient acquisition strategy, for explaining PSFs (

 </xref>,

 </xref>). Furthermore, while it is unknown as to how interactions between plants and soil biotic communities will evolve in response to proxies of climate change, it is likely that they will affect the outcome of PSFs with potential consequences for vegetation dynamics, ecosystem processes, and feedback effects to climate. For example, drought can alter soil bacterial and fungal communities and modify the direction of PSFs and plant competitive interactions (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>21</italic>
 </xref>); soil bacterial communities in the tropics and at high latitudes are subjected to stronger environmental filtering and include more edaphic-niche specialists, possibly rendering these communities more vulnerable to global change (
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>). As such, climate change is likely to have both strong direct effects on plants and soil organisms, as well as indirect effects through changes in plant physiology and the quality and quantity of resources entering soil (i.e., as litter and rhizodeposits) (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This will, in turn, have potentially large consequences for PSFs, vegetation dynamics, and feedback effects to local or even global climate conditions. In sum, and despite the complexity and high variety of processes involved, our ability to make predictions involving PSFs is improving, and in the future, it should increasingly be possible to apply this knowledge to address environmental challenges such as climate change mitigation or ecosystem restoration by using nature-based solutions, as well as informing conservation policies.
