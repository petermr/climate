<p>Recent evidence suggests that PSFs involve myriad interactions among a diversity of beneficial and antagonistic microbes. For example, the same graminoid microbial [arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi] partners can shift from beneficial to antagonistic depending on microsite conditions (

 </xref>). Similarly, although AM fungi are often beneficial to trees (

 </xref>), tree species with AM fungi have also been shown to more often experience negative feedback in comparison to ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees, which predominantly display positive feedback (

 </xref>). In addition, studies reveal that these effects of soil fungi on PSFs vary across fungal guilds (

 </xref>): Feedbacks might become more negative as the richness of plant pathogens and specialist decomposers increases and become more positive as the diversity of AM fungi increases (
