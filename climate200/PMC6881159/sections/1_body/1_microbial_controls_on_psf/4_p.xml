<p>Evidence suggests that climate change may affect the biodiversity and function of soil microbes. Rainfall timing plays a critical role on the abundance and diversity of soil microbial populations in grasslands (

 </xref>). This suggests that rare taxa should not be overlooked when modeling microbial responses to climate change and their potential consequences for plants.
