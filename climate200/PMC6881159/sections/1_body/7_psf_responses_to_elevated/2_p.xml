<p>Organisms at higher trophic levels play a role in the soil food web, but two groups of soil microbes have particularly important roles in these processes and, thus, in the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to eCO
 <sub>2</sub>: the mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi and heterotrophic decomposers (
 <xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). Their characteristics and tendencies may help us solve the puzzle of the eCO
 <sub>2</sub> responses outlined above. They are important because (i) nutrient limitation on plant responses to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> may be modulated by the type of nutrient-acquisition strategy, which, in turn, may be largely determined by mutualistic symbiotic plant-microbe interaction, and (ii) eCO
 <sub>2</sub> may increase nutrient cycling or have neutral or suppressive effects due to the regulation by and impacts on both mycorrhizae and decomposer communities.
