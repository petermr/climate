<p>Our understanding of whether or how eCO
 <sub>2</sub> will drive complex interactions of soil communities in space and time remains limited, despite the considerable advances briefly outlined above. For example, a 20-year free-air CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment study found that the impact of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on microbial-mediated nutrient cycling and, consequently, on the responses of biomass to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> can change over time in ways unpredicted by theory because of poorly understood mechanisms (

 </xref>). The impacts of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on soil N cycling in this study shifted from positive to negative over time in C3 grass communities and from negative to positive over time in C4 grass communities. These shifts in N cycling contributed to parallel shifts in the responses of biomass to eCO
 <sub>2</sub>; biomass enhancement due to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> disappeared over time in the C3 grass communities and increased over time in the C4 grass communities. Changes in the composition, abundance, and function of both mycorrhizal and decomposer communities likely played influential roles in these temporal shifts, but we have neither the empirical evidence to characterize that pattern nor a sufficient theoretical foundation to conceptually explain it convincingly. The possibility that long-term changes in soil communities, including their responses to eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and cascading biogeochemical impacts, may follow a diversity of possible pathways that are broader than we have anticipated suggests that we should be cautious in our confidence to predict these interactions, or their consequences, in the long term. This caution becomes even more apparent when we consider the potential interactions among eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, temperature, and/or moisture on soil communities and PSFs (
