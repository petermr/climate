<p>Long-term eCO
 <sub>2</sub> also influences soil decomposer communities in ways that likely influence decomposition and the potential storage of soil C. For example, eCO
 <sub>2</sub> in a long-term eCO
 <sub>2</sub> experiment in perennial grassland led to distinct microbial communities (

 </xref>). The abundances of key C-fixation genes; some C-degrading genes involved in the decomposition of starch, cellulose, and hemicellulose; and functional genes involved in N cycling were also higher (
