<p>The turnover of plant species due to climate change can greatly affect litter decomposition (

 </xref>). Field and laboratory experiments have shown that litter quality determines the functional characteristics of the soil decomposer community. Recalcitrant litter can contain considerable amounts of polyphenols (e.g., phenolic acids and flavonoids) or polymers (e.g., condensed tannins) that require high activation energy (

 </xref>) and inhibit microbial decomposition (
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). Recalcitrant litter would, however, promote microbial communities specialized in degrading complex plant polymers (

  <italic>70</italic>
 </xref>), so slow microbial metabolism and nutrient release will favor slow-growing plant species. Furthermore, under warmer and drier conditions, fungal metabolism can shift toward maintenance at the expense of the production of enzymes that break down plant-carbon compounds, with concomitant effects on plant communities and ecosystem carbon dynamics (

  <italic>71</italic>
 </xref>). Under different scenarios, it is likely that communities dominated by fast-growing species will continue to produce high-quality litter, which may promote soil microbial communities that will decompose litter at faster rates (

 </xref>), maintaining high soil nutrient availability where fast-growing species thrive (
