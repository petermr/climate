<p>Understanding the mechanisms underlying the context-dependent nature of PSFs is critical for understanding and predicting how pathways of succession and range shifts develop in terrestrial ecosystems under a changing global climate and, therefore, the types of species that are likely to dominate the plant communities. It is also of importance for predicting how climate change will affect ecosystem processes, including potential carbon cycle feedbacks at different spatial scales. How climate change affects decomposers, mutualistic symbionts, and pathogens, and their net effects on PSFs needs further study; although these effects are heavily context dependent, certain general patterns are emerging. Identifying the specific microbial and food web processes, including changes in the abundance of key taxa, microbe-microbe and microbe-invertebrate interactions involved in nutrient supply, and trophic interactions within soil food webs, is needed to determine the underlying drivers and mechanisms underpinning this context dependency (

Further studies are needed to understand how warming and changes in precipitation affect these interactions, including the importance of rhizodeposits, which are often overlooked in studies of decomposition.
