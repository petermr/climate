<p>If water and nutrients become limiting, the role of mutualistic symbionts in the soil food web, which are involved in plant nutrient acquisition and drought tolerance, may increase: AM fungi and N fixers both lead to positive PSFs, which can promote primary production if all other conditions remain unaltered (

 </xref>). This scenario may also affect plant community composition, with an increased dominance of plant species that fix N and/or those forming AM (
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>55</italic>
 </xref>). These plant species, however, are not necessarily less influenced by soil-borne pathogens (

 </xref>), and PSFs may easily become more negative, because climatic extremes may increase the vulnerability of plants to herbivores or pathogens (
