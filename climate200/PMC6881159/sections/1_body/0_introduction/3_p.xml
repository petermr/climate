<p>Here, we address the responses of PSFs to climate change and their consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and potential feedback effects to climate change. We first consider how soil microbes control PSFs, because the vast diversity of beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms that interact with plant roots or feed on detritus and rhizodeposits can directly affect plant performance (

Soil communities contain a myriad of species that comprise a trophic network of primary producers and consumers, and of secondary and higher-level consumers (

 </xref>) that could be altered by changing climate (

 </xref>). We thus focus on how climate change affects PSFs and soil food webs, with emphasis on both the impacts of increased temperature and climate extremes, especially drought (

 </xref>). We then outline how climate change will affect litterfall and the production of root exudates, which control the structure and dynamics of soil communities. Last, we focus on how increased levels of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> directly (i.e., not indirectly via a changing climate) influence PSFs, which will occur simultaneously with its feedback effects to climate.
