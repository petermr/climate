<p>PSFs are often important drivers of plant species replacement and, thus, succession, which includes impacts of both soil biota associated with plant roots and those involved in the decomposer subsystem (

 </xref>). Given that disturbance associated with climate change may increase in the future (e.g., more fires, more windthrow), impacts on, and consequences of, PSF-driven succession will likely increase in importance. Feedbacks between early successional plant species and their root-associated soil biota frequently contribute to the replacement of these species by other species. This replacement may arise, for example, by early successional species promoting the accumulation of soil pathogens that negatively affect them (

 </xref>). By contrast, late successional species often form positive associations with their soil biota and, notably, with mycorrhizal fungi, which slows succession. For example, along a chronosequence of Dutch (old field) grasslands on abandoned arable land, early successional plant species consistently underwent negative feedbacks with their soil biota, while late successional plants only underwent positive feedbacks (

 </xref>). PSFs involving soil biota can also alter plant succession by altering the supply of soil nutrients available to plants. Decomposer biota can thus accelerate succession by mineralizing nutrients that facilitate later successional species that then outcompete earlier species (
