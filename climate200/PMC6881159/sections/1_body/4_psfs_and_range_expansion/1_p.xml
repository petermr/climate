<p>An important element of climate change is range shifts of plants, soil animals, and microbial taxa over time (

 </xref>). Few studies have compared PSF effects between the original and new ranges but suggest that range shifts enable plant species to become released from negative PSFs (

 </xref>). In the new range, PSFs are expected to become more negative over time because of pathogen accumulation (

 </xref>); in the meantime, range-shifting plant populations may have invasive characteristics and potentially reduce local native plant biodiversity (

  <italic>60</italic>
 </xref>). Range shifts seem to have much weaker effects on plant-mutualist symbiotic relationships and plant-decomposer interactions than on other plant-microbe interactions, possibly due to the lower degree of host specificity of these microbes. Thus, direct effects of climate on temperature and rainfall, along with species range shifts, are likely to affect PSFs. PSFs during range shifts under climate change will most likely turn from negative in the home range to less negative, or even positive in the new range. However, these effects can be dynamic when considering longer time periods and are ultimately expected to become more negative over time because of cointroduction of the native pathogens or evolutionary developments of local pathogens (
