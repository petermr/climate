<p>Recent evidence suggests that range shift of plant species as a consequence of climate change may be essential for the adaptation of ecosystems to novel climatic conditions (

 </xref>). However, when range-expanding plant species have invasive properties, they may change ecosystem processes, for example, through altered nutrient cycling and interactions with above- and belowground biota (

Managing these types of changes in ecosystems will be crucial, and the maintenance of soil biodiversity is expected to ensure soil functioning under a variety of novel climatic conditions (
