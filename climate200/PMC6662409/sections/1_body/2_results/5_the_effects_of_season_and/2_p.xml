<p>Following the model selection criteria outlined above, the final selected model was the same for both species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35292-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Besides age class, season and year were both included as predictors of survival. For Natterer's bats, the model with an interaction between season and year returned a smaller AICc. However, this did not exceed the required difference of 2 to the next best and simpler model. Thus, adult survival in both species showed a consistent pattern between seasons (summer vs. winter) that varied in severity across years.
