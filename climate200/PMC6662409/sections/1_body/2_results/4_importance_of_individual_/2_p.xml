<p>As predicted, age class was a major determinant of survival in both species. Survival of juveniles during their first winter was on average about 30 percentage points lower in Daubenton's bats and 20 percentage points lower in Natterer's bats (Table

 <xref rid="ece35292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Neither of the species‐specific models supported a general sex difference in survival (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35292-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The standard deviation of the individual‐specific random intercept was comparable in both species, leading to a moderate intraclass correlation (ICC) of about 0.2 (Table
