<p>Regression models were then used to study the effects of the individual characteristics sex and age class as well as of changing environment on survival. The binary response—survival or death—was modeled by logistic regression with an individual‐specific random intercept to account for repeated observations per individual and potential interindividual variation in survival which remained unexplained by the covariates. As Culina and co‐authors in their study on three bat species reported differences between sexes and age classes, as well as different effects of environmental parameters on survival (Culina et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), we set up the model separately for each species. Sex and age class (juvenile or adult) were included as binary covariates with fixed effects. As the animals were observed at the hibernaculum, it should be noted that survival of juveniles can only be estimated in their first winter; thereafter, the animals enter the adult age class (Table
