<p>We compared models based on the values of the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) (Burnham, Anderson, &amp; Huyvaert,

 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>), which converges to the AIC for large samples. Simpler models were selected over more complex models with a lower AICc whenever the differences in the AICc values were smaller than 2 (Burnham et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on the scale of the linear predictor from the variance of the individual‐specific random intercept (Rodríguez &amp; Elo,
