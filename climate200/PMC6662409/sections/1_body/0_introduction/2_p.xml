<p>Seasonality describes a regularly and often predictable change in the environment following an annual cycle (Battey, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). In regions showing strong seasonality, organisms developed various mechanisms such as migration (Gienapp, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and hibernation (Geiser, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) that allows them to survive seasons with food and/or water shortages. Especially in times of climate change, it is crucial to understand the impact of changing environmental conditions on the abovementioned mechanisms to deal with seasonality, as this may strongly effect individual survival and, thus, ultimately population persistence (Newson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Sherwin, Montgomery, &amp; Lundy, 
 <xref rid="ece35292-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As a first step, it is necessary to identify basic annual survival patterns and assess their variability across years. The identification of seasons that are potentially sensitive to environmental changes and the assessment of their importance for individual survival, as well as the identification of individual traits (e.g., sex, age class) that influence survival outcomes, are crucial for understanding current and future population dynamics (Le CÅ“ur, Chantepie, Pisanu, Chapuis, &amp; Robert,
