  <p>Estimated survival probabilities based on the finally selected mixed‐effects logistic regression models. In both species‐specific models, a random intercept was included for each individual. The model for Natterer's bats (
   <italic>Myotis nattereri</italic>, red circles/points) was built excluding the exceptional winter 2010/2011. The results of the best model for Daubenton's bats (
   <italic>Myotis daubentonii</italic>, blue triangles) and of the one for Natterer's bats—in both cases including season, age class, and year as fixed effects— are shown. Winter periods are denoted by “w” and the respective years, while summer periods are labeled as “s” combined with the respective year. Due to sampling at a hibernaculum, we were only able to estimate juvenile survival over winter. Juveniles are characterized by open symbols, while adults are defined by filled symbols
