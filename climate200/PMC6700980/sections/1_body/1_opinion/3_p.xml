<p id="Par6">SSB, which enables the design and modulation of cellular phenotypes in ways that could scarcely have been imagined even a decade ago, can amplify the power of the entire range of land management practices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], from agriculture to forestry, that help regulate the flow of carbon between its reservoirs. In principle, the development of land management technologies using the modern methods of molecular science [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] can not only remove atmospheric carbon, but will, as with the Human Genome Project [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], likely lead to multiple insights and opportunities having wide- ranging scientific and economic ramifications well beyond climate control.
