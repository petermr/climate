<p id="Par4">The good news is that for the US and other technologically advanced nations, the cost of generating electricity by renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar power is economically competitive with that of coal (

As of now, however, most signatories to the Paris Accord are not meeting their targets [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], while they simultaneously struggle to meet their growing energy needs. More generally, a number of economic sectors including agriculture, construction, some forms of transportation, and waste will not be easily impacted by carbon-neutral sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. All of this suggests that absent the physical removal of carbon from the atmosphere (so-called negative emission), the planet’s global average temperature at the end of the century is unlikely to be less than 2 °C above its preindustrial level [
