<p>However, the results of this study found that consumers’ subjective norms toward insect foods are not significantly correlated with purchase intention (β = 0.062,

 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] nonetheless observed that young consumers’ willingness to purchase green products can be predicted through subjective norms. This study postulates that this is probably because insect foods are not consistent with Taiwanese food culture, and therefore consumers are not likely to try such foods on a whim. With regard to home appliances, it is likely that the variation in the previous research results is because there are few brands that are respected by consumers, meaning consumers do not consult the opinions of others on this topic.
