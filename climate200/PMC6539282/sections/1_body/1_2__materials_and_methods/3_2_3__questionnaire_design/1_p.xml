<p>The questionnaire design of this study comprises six sections and is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01606">Appendix A</xref>. Sections one to three deal with the scale for the TPB. In these sections, questions related to attitude and subjective norms refer to the study by Menozzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and investigate the perception of consumers toward the consumption of insect food products using three questions, and whether consumers are influenced by reference objects and purchase insect food as a result using another three questions. Next, the questionnaire addresses perceived behavioral control, referring to the studies by Ajzen [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Menozzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to investigate the ease with which consumers purchase insect foods. This section includes four items, with a total of ten questions. The fourth section addresses consumers’ environmental concern, referring to the research by Dunlap and Van Liere [
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] to establish a scale for environmental concern and investigate consumer perceptions and attitudes toward the environment. The fifth section addresses consumer food neophobia with regard to insect foods and applies a scale developed by consulting the work of Pliner and Hobden [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Siegrist et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and Jaeger et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It includes six questions that measure respondents’ individual levels of food neophobia. The sixth section addresses consumer willingness to purchase insect foods. The studies by Chen and Cheng [
 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], and Singh and Verma [
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] were consulted to develop a scale for purchase intention and determine the likelihood that consumers will purchase insect foods. In lists 1–6 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-01606">Appendix A</xref>), a 7-point Likert scale is used, allowing respondents to provide ratings ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7). The seventh section addresses basic information about respondents, including their gender, profession, education level, and average monthly income.
