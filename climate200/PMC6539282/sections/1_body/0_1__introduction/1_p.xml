<p>According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] of the United Nations, the global population will reach 9 billion by 2050. Furthermore, in the light of the myriad of environmental concerns we are faced with, including global climate change, shortages in global arable land, and so on, in response to this rapid population growth, food volumes must increase. Comparing edible insects with average traditional livestock, raising 1 kg of edible insects on average only requires 2 kg of feed, whereas raising 1 kg of beef requires 8 kg of feed. Furthermore, they also help to reduce environmental burdens, emit far less greenhouse gases, and require much less land and water than mammals and birds [

The amount of land used per kg of insect protein is 50–90% lower than that of traditional livestock, 40–80% less per kilogram of edible food, and their GHGEs (greenhouse gas emissions) are 1000–2700 grams lower. The study confirmed that there are five edible insects (

 <italic>Pachnoda marginata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lapatia dubia</italic>) with greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions equivalent to pigs, but far less than the emissions of cattle. In addition, the amount of carbon dioxide produced per kilogram is lower than that of traditional livestock [
