<p>Numerous studies have examined the link between insect foods and purchase intention [

The most frequently utilized among these is the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is commonly considered as being effective in predicting general behavior. The TPB argues that the following three factors, in combination, are responsible for forming behavioral intentions—perceived behavioral control, attitude toward the behavior in question, and subjective norms [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Based on the theory of planned behavior, Ajzen [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] pointed out that perceived behavioral control means “an individual’s perceived ease or difficulty in performing a particular behavior”. An attitude toward a behavior is considered to be the “degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in question”. “Subjective norms” can also be divided into individual behavioral norms and social norms. Personal behavioral norms mainly come from the influence of important reference objects formed by parents, friends, peers, or experts. Social norms refer to the influence of pressure from other social groups to perform or not perform the behavior. This means that an individual who possesses a reasonably high level of behavioral control for a particular behavior will have a higher chance of show-casing a firm intention to engage in that behavior. “Behavioral intention” indicates a person’s willingness to conduct a certain behavior, with the assumption that this willingness must necessarily exist before the behavior itself is executed [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Menozzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] used the TPB to investigate the intentions and expected behaviors of young Italian consumers on the consumption of flour and chocolate biscuits containing 10% crickets. Their study found that the primary obstacles to the consumption of insect-containing flour products is the aversion generated from seeing nearby insects, nonconformance to local food culture, and the lack of related products in supermarkets. According to Menozzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01606" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in relation to insect foods, modern consumers maintain a certain degree of reservations toward purchasing insect food products. This may be the result of consumers’ aversion to insects, incompatible local food cultures, or consumers not having seen such products before.
