<p>In summary, we agree with the concerns raised by Wang and D’Odorico (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and emphasize that multidisciplinary sustainability research is vital, and ongoing, with various studies already published. Together with this impact study, we should now be able to identify sustainable locations for plantations which enhance rainfall. The combined findings indicate that large swathes of arid coastline exist with high atmospheric potential—particularly around the Sahara, Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and Namibia. If sufficient resources can be found there, those regions represent more than enough area to contribute significantly to a wider afforestation strategy.
