<p>Another observation by Wang and D’Odorico (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) is that our ideal global locations differ from those of the global tree restoration study of Bastin et al. (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This is perhaps not surprising, given the differing requirements for plantations and rainfed deciduous/coniferous forest (assumed in most “afforestation” scenarios). An exception to this may be high-elevation semiarid forests (
