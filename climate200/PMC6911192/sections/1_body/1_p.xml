<p>We agree entirely that water resources are vital for the sustainability of desert plantations. However, the focus of this work (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) is not water quantities per se, but the rainfall enhancement process and regional potential. As such, it complements essential multidisciplinary studies. We refer readers to 2 of our feasibility publications on desert agroforestry (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The first investigates feasibility of jojoba and other crops in the United Arab Emirates, and the second showcases large 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> plantations in desert regions. Both consider water and other resources in quantitative analyses. The latter study estimates a carbon accumulation of ∼17 to 25 Gkg C⋅y
 <sup>−1</sup>, and both studies indicate that coastal regions are preferable given their proximity to water sources. Theory aside, profitable jojoba plantations of 2 to 3 km
 <sup>2</sup> have already been operational for decades, for example, in Israel (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and we envisage that scaling up by approximately an order of magnitude is quite feasible and sustainable.
