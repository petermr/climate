 <caption> Attribution of probability change in potential compound flooding (CF) to changes in dependence and marginal distribution. Multimodel mean of projected change (%) of CF return periods between future (2070–2099) and present (1970–2004) when only taking into account future changes of: the overall ( A) dependence [Spearman and tail dependence ( 3 )] between sea level and precipitation, ( B) sea level distribution, and ( C) precipitation distribution (Materials and Methods). The total projected probability variation ( Fig. 3A) is not given by the sum of these three cases (A, B, and C), as the overall dependencies and marginal distributions do not contribute linearly to the CF return periods. SLR is not considered in the definition of future sea levels (see text). Gray points indicate locations where only four or fewer of six models agree on the sign of the return period change (three or less of five models in the Black Sea). </caption>
