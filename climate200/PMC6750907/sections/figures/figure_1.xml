  <title>Synoptic weather conditions driving extreme events.</title>
  <p>Composite maps of sea level pressure (hPa, in white) and total column water fields computed over days where extreme events (&gt;99.5th percentile) occurred in Plymouth (UK, top) and Ancona (Italy, bottom) indicated by the red dots (based on ERA-Interim data, 1980â€“2014). Here, the astronomical tide component of the sea level is not considered to focus only on the meteorological-driven part. Extreme events type: (
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) compound flooding (CF), (
   <bold>B</bold> and 
   <bold>E</bold>) storm surge but not extreme precipitation, and (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>F</bold>) extreme precipitation but not storm surge. The total number of extreme events considered for computing the composite maps is shown at the bottom left corner of the panels. Storm surges include the wave setup contribution (see text).
