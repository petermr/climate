<p>The interaction of high sea level and heavy precipitation may cause compound flooding (CF), a coastal hazard that can result in substantial damages and fatalities (

  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>) lists 24 co-occurrences of storm surges and river floods along the Irish, U.K., Belgian, and Polish coasts, the French Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, and the Italian Adriatic coast. Estimating the coastal flooding risk is essential for policy-making, disaster risk reduction, and engineering practices. At the moment, the CF hazard is usually omitted in coastal flooding risk analyses, implying that sea and river flooding are considered as independent phenomena (
