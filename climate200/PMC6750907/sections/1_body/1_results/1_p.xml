<p>To characterize extreme sea level, we consider daily maximum values of the superposition of storm surges (including waves) and astronomical tides. In the following, we will refer to these maxima simply as sea level. Storm surges and waves are simulated with the hydrodynamic D-FLOW Flexible Mesh (FM) (

 </xref>) models, respectively, forced with ERA-Interim reanalysis data (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>) for present climate (1979–2014), and with data from six selected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>) for present (1970–2004) and future climate (2070–2099). Astronomical tides are simulated separately considering the effects of SLR during the century (see Materials and Methods for more details). Precipitation is directly taken from the reanalysis and the six CMIP5 models. On each day, we consider accumulated precipitation within a time range of ±1 days, which allows us to account for precipitation occurring just before and after midnight of the storm surge day (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>25</italic>
 </xref>) and for the mentioned mechanisms responsible for CF. This approach cannot account for CF caused by a storm surge concurring with high river discharge driven by a previous weather system. However, it allows for indirectly considering CF caused by moving weather systems that first cause precipitation further inland around the coast and later a storm surge (see Materials and Methods for a discussion). We define univariate extremes of the individual hazards as events occurring on average every 1 year for sea level and precipitation (fig. S2) (the results are similar to when using 200 days and 5 years as thresholds to define the univariate extremes). We compute the CF return period (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>CF</sub>), which is defined here as the average waiting time between the co-occurrence of these extreme events (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>) (see Materials and Methods for a discussion on the return period definition). 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>CF</sub> corresponds to the reciprocal of the probability of this co-occurrence (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>CF</sub>), i.e., 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>CF</sub> = 1/
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>CF</sub>; hence, in the following, we will alternatively refer to return periods or probabilities as a low return period corresponds to a high probability and vice versa. We model the dependence of sea level and precipitation extremes by a copula-based multivariate probability model. For details, refer to Materials and Methods, and for an evaluation of the simulated CF probability, see the Supplementary Materials (figs. S3 to S5).
