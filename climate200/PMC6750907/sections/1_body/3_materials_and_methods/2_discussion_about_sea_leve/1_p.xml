<p>The different sea level components were considered as independent in this study (i.e., SLR, astronomical tides, waves, and storm surges), and the only nonlinear interaction resolved was the effect of SLR on astronomical tides. This is an inevitable assumption for continental-scale studies due to the current computational, storage, and modeling capabilities. Astronomical tides and storm surges interact (

 </xref>), and extreme sea levels occur during spring tides, the timing of which is to a large extent deterministic. However, as the timing of extreme weather events in a general circulation model is stochastic, coupled modeling would require several realizations of the same scenario to resolve the tidal modulation of weather driven of sea level extremes. Given that hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive, these simulations would not be feasible. The same limitation applies for resolving SLR effects on storm surge or waves (

 </xref>). The multiple possible SLR trajectories would require repeating the simulations multiple times, which is computationally prohibitive, as would be the model resolution needed to resolve properly such interactions at European scale. In addition, recent studies have shown that the nonlinear effect of SLR on extreme sea levels also depends on the future shoreline dynamics (

 </xref>), which is highly uncertain. Last, waves and currents also interact, but to our knowledge, there is no continental scale model that can simulate both processes in a coupled manner. The approach of considering the sea level components as independent is common in large-scale studies like the present (
