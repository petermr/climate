Sea level and precipitation data were based on ERA-Interim and six selected models from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble (i.e., ACCESS1-0, ACCESS1-3, GFDL-ESM2M, GFDL-ESM2G, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and EC-EARTH). CMIP5 models were selected on the basis of the skill in representing the synoptic climatologies and interannual variations across the northeast Atlantic region (
