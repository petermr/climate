<p>Rising mean sea levels will pose the main threat along coastal areas in a warmer climate (

 </xref>). Here, we have demonstrated that CF will have substantial additional changes to those caused by SLR and that the CF hazard should be taken into account for a complete present and future risk assessment. In particular, Northern Europe will experience an increasing probability of concurring high sea level and heavy precipitation beyond the effects of mean SLR, caused mainly by more intense precipitation in a warmer climate. We have shown that ignoring the dependency in the occurrence of heavy precipitation and storm surges may underestimate the CF probability in a warming climate by up to two orders of magnitude. Given the high cost of implementing flood risk reduction measures, these interventions require careful planning, supported by detailed flood risk assessments. Our study identifies the European regions potentially facing CF in a warmer future climate, thereby providing a continental-scale basis for follow-up local CF risk assessments and adaptation planning.
