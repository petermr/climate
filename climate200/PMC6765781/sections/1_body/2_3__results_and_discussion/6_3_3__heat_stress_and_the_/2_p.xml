<p>As earlier mentioned by Kjellstrom et al., there are two pathways that extreme heat exposure impacts could manifest in workers [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both physiological and psychological tasks and heat balance within the human body are determined by six fundamental factors that include; air temperature; radiant temperature; humidity; air movement (wind speed); clothing; and the metabolic heat generated by human physical activity. As such, perceptual awareness alongside the control over work conditions, work rates, and work limits are immediate adaptation mechanisms against heat exposure among individual workers. To address the physiological impact caused by heat exposure, several heat stress indices have been developed. These have been developed in order to help in the prediction of physiological strain experienced among workers due to exposure to stressful environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The use of indexes provides information between climate parameters (air temperature, air humidity, air movement over the skin (wind speed) and heat radiation (i.e., from the sun)) which can then be linked to a corresponding physiological strain. The results of these indices can be used in the design or establishment of safe work practices, work limits and work conditions. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) was developed by the US Army in the 1950s to help reduce exposure to excess heat. WBGT is now the most widely used tool for occupational heat stress assessment. It takes into consideration four environmental factors; air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and radiation [
