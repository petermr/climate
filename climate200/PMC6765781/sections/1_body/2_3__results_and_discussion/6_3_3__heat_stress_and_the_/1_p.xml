<p>While individuals are in general capable of acclimatizing to different levels of heat, it is worth noting that every worker also has an upper limit to heat exposure, stress beyond which will become unbearable and may cause health related ailments and—in extreme cases—can lead to mortality. Understandably, there is limited, or no adaptation measures considered for outdoor workers involved with constant physical labor and working in humid conditions. There is an increased likelihood of these workers experiencing heat stress, which could lead to reduced work performance and capacity, with potentially significant economic consequences [

Wherever the ambient temperature exceeds 35 °C, there is a greater chance of it causing fatigue and physical exhaustion among workers in general. There is also an increased risk of errors, which could be catastrophic, especially where concentration is required for the safe handling and operation of machinery. Outdoor women worker’s health is another problem that has drawn attention recently; in particular, during pregnancy as it creates additional heat stress problems. Respiratory and cardiovascular disease, secondary to exposure to poor air quality, has been found to have a larger impact on women because of their greater propensity for higher deposition of particulate matter in lung tissue [

However, pregnant women exposed to extreme heat are faced with additional health risks, including poor pregnancy health and birth outcomes, as highlighted in earlier reports [
