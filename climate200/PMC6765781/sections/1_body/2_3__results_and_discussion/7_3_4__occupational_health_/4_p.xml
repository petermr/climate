<p>Apart from the effects of extreme heat, a higher temperature can lead to increased ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter air pollution, thereby increasing the risk of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, reduced lung function and other respiratory illnesses (

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] developed a conceptual framework. This framework highlights the impact climate change is likely to have on the workplace among different workers, including occupational morbidity, mortality, and injury as influenced by several driving and contextual factors. The likely hazards that will occur in different settings may include increased ambient temperature; air pollution; ultraviolet (UV) radiation; extreme weather; expanded vector habitats; industrial transitions and emerging industries; and changes in the built environment.
