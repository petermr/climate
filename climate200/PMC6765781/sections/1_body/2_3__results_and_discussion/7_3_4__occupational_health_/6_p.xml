<p>In addition, workers in areas with poor water drainage management and areas that encourage vector breeding are affected by extreme climate events. This is especially concerning considering that some of these vector borne diseases i.e., yellow fever, malaria, dengue and chikungunya are sensitive to climatic changes and likely to expand in geographic zones and affect a diverse range of worker populations [

For instance, the per capita mortality rate from vector-borne diseases is projected to be 300 times greater in developing nations than in developed regions. This is due in part to their prevalence in the tropical regions and low socioeconomic development, which has a negative impact on the quality of health care services delivered [
