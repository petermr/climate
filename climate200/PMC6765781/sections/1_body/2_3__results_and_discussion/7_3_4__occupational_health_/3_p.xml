<p>Where these workers are exposed to a higher temperature than 37 Â°C, for their body to stay at a healthy temperature they will have to lose this excessive heat through sweat evaporation. However, as earlier reported [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] high external air humidity and clothing type were identified as limitations sweat evaporation and regulation of body temperature. Therefore, to avoid heat stroke workers will need to reduce their work rate, take more rest, and rehydrate. However, Moda and Alshahrani [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that outdoor workers on construction sites in Saudi Arabia described the lack of palatable water as a key set back to their water intake and rehydration. This is often caused by the portable water provision on site becoming warm during the day due to lack of a cooler, thus leaving the workers dehydrated, exhausted and at some point, experiencing severe fatigue among other symptoms reported. In addition, heat stress and fatigue suffered by these workers negatively impacted their levels of alertness and work capacity. This led to the frequent occurrence of safety lapses leading to a high risk of injury at work. Most workplaces in developing countries do not have a heat stress index on site, therefore workers rely on environmental temperature references from the weather station for the city, as reported by Moda and Alshahrani [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Unfortunately, the immediate local ambient temperature could vary from that reported by the weather station and the workers might be exposed to a more extreme temperature than reported.
