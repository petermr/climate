However, precipitation in the Western part of the continent will vary. Further to this, the near surface temperatures in most parts of Africa has seen an increased temperature rise of 0.5 Â°C or more in the last century, with minimum temperatures warming more rapidly than maximum temperatures. These trends may have been influenced by other components of natural variability and human activity [
