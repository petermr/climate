<p>Key research priorities need to meet this challenge. It is firstly important to investigate effective adaptation measures to ensure workers involved in heavy labour are not faced with an increased risk of heat stress, which could affect their health, work performance and work capacity [

These guides should take into account several factors likely to play a role in climate change and heat exposure, which could affect the individualâ€™s sensitivity to heat tolerance [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, there is also a need to consider intervention strategies around workers coping mechanisms, including adaptation and social protection measures when designing engineering solutions. Furthermore, research on the role of administrative controls along with studies on how to enhance education and awareness on the management of climate change and heat exposure among workers in general is considered timely, especially in Africa. There is also the need to ensure the establishment of a platform capable of overcoming barriers to climate change adaptation and heat stress risk which takes into consideration resource availability and technological advancements in tropical regions [
