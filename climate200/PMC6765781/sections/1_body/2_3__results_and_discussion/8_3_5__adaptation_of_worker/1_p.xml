<p>There is the need for occupational climate change policies be considered at a micro level, especially since adaptive capacity may vary between groups, communities, and individuals and will rely on the vulnerability level, resilience, and resource availability as the global temperature continues to rise. Heat stress exposure and associated health effects cannot be ignored in the workplace, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where climate change is more pronounced. On this note, it is imperative that climate change adaptation be considered at various workplace levels and is not a collectivist approach, which does not take into account the diverse needs of the varying workers.</p>
