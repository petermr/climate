<p>Health impacts from UHI are more severe during the summertime, the season of immensely high temperature or heat waves. Thus, heat-related mortality is likely to increase in future due to climate change [

Heat mortality may occur due to the overloading of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as physiological reactions to heat exposure. The physiological reactions that take place are increased heart rate, increased body temperature, increased sweating, fluctuation of blood flow towards the skin from the central organs, and dehydration [

This increased temperature causes a lack of relief at night and prevents the body from recovering from the heat exposure experienced during the day [
