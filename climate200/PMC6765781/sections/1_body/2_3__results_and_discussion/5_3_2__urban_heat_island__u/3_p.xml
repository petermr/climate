<p>The UHI phenomenon can lead to an increase in energy consumption due to the demand for more use of cooling devices, thus increasing the overall electricity use. The companies which supply the electricity rely on power plants which typically use fossil fuels to meet the required demand, which results in the release of air pollutants and emission of greenhouse gases. These gases include Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, among others, all of which negatively impact air quality and contribute to ground-level ozone formation, particulate matter generation and acid rain. The elderly population, minors and those with existing heart conditions are most likely to be affected by these effects [
