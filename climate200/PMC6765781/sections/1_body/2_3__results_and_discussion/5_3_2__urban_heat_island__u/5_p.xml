<p>The ‘heat island effect’ is partly responsible for the current changes in temperature in many cities. People working outdoors (such as traffic wardens, fire fighters, road sweepers, landscapers’ petty traders, construction workers etc.), during the hottest periods face an additional 3–5 °C increase in temperature which will make heavy work very challenging [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03458" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. When working in a hot environment, workers (including healthy ones) are under tremendous strain. Their sweating (body’s cooling mechanism) efficacy is reduced due to limited air movement towards the skin. In addition, the protective clothing used by workers which protects them from exposure to chemicals, trauma, and other pollutants, may hinder evaporative heat loss, further reducing the sweating efficacy. Another factor that may increase UHI is the inadequate intake of water which results in dehydration, and therefore reduces sweating and resultant heat loss. Dehydration also contributes to impairment of mental and physical performance [
