<p>From the studies considered, it is evident that the frequency and intensity of extreme hot weather conditions due to climate change, extreme workplace heat exposure and the abatement of workplace ill health and injury will continue to present challenges, in the developing countries located in the tropics, and the globe at large, especially in fast-paced work environments. To date, most studies on climate change impacts and health have focused on the general publicâ€™s health. Limited documented evidence exists on climate change impact on occupational health and safety among outdoor workers, especially in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa where its impact is mostly felt. While approaches are considered for the protection of workers from extreme heat exposure due to climate change, there is also the need for the development of appropriate surveillance programmes, thus enabling the proper assessment of occupational heat exposure and related injury and illness because of climate change extremes within different occupational sectors.</p>
