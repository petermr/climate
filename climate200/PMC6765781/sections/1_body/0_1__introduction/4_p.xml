<p>The purpose of the paper is to summarize the existing knowledge and synthesize the impact of climate change adaptation and occupational health and safety. In order to achieve this, the paper provides concise a review concerning new findings around relevant health impacts associated with climate change, extreme heat exposure and comments on different adaptation strategies available to decision makers to alleviate the impact of climate change factors and outdoor workersâ€™ productivity. Due to limited research work carried out in tropical developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the paper aims to draw more research attention around emerging research areas as they relate to the impact of extreme heat exposure, climate change adaptation measures and health and safety concerns among outdoor workers (individuals that spend more than 4 h working outside) within these countries. It will consider the likelihood of effects on their productivity and occupational safety. Aside from the direct impact caused by extreme heat exposure, other indirect health hazards associated with increasing heat among this group include exposure to hazardous chemicals and other vector diseases, which will also be addressed. By proposing micro-adaptation alternatives, this study will help policymakers adopt effective means of meeting the challenges posed by climate change exposure.</p>
