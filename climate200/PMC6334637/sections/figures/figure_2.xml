  <p>Trends in maximum cumulative water deficit (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content>) across the Amazon Basin. (a) Frequency of annual linear trends in 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> per plot between 1985 and 2014. Note that for most plots, the climate has significantly shifted towards more negative 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> values. Mean change and 95% confidence intervals (black solid and dashed lines) across our plots weighting plots by plot area were calculated using a bootstrap procedure by resampling the trends in 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> from all plots 10,000 times with replacement. (b) Distribution of annual linear trends in 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> per plot. Arrows pointing down (in red) represent locations where 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> has become more negative over time, that is the dry season has become more intense. Arrows pointing up (blue) represent less negative values of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> meaning that moisture stress decreased. The intensity of the colours in (a,b) represent the strength of the climate trend. Note the difference in scale between drying and wetting trends colour bars. (c) Mean annual 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> across plots, and 95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> from resampling among all plots, note lower 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MCWD</styled-content> values at 2004–2005 and 2009–2010 (grey‐shaded rectangles)
