<p>Environmental changes could have different impacts along each of these ecological axes (Chave et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Lewis, Lloyd, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Most notably, with more extended or intense periods of soil water deficit, large trees and those with low wood density may be at greatest risk of hydraulic failure due to cavitation (McDowell &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Rowland et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Large trees have been shown to be particularly affected by artificially‐imposed drought (McDowell &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Nepstad, Tohver, Ray, Moutinho, &amp; Cardinot, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Rowland et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and drought events (Bennett, Mcdowell, Allen, &amp; Anderson‐Teixeira, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). On the other hand, several observations from tropical forests show a decline of small understory taxa associated with increases in soil water deficit (e.g. Condit, Hubbell, &amp; Foster, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Enquist &amp; Enquist, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Feeley, Davies, Perez, Hubbell, &amp; Foster, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). To explain these observations, it has been hypothesized that small taxa have shallower roots and are therefore more vulnerable compared to large, deep rooted trees to long‐term drying trends (Condit et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Although the link between rooting depth and tree size is still unclear (Stahl et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), this hypothesis is consistent with wetter areas tending to have more densely populated understoreys (Malhi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Pitman et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>) and taller forests being less sensitive to precipitation variability (Giardina et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The ongoing increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is also expected to cause changes in species composition as it is predicted to favour those trees that have greater competitive capacity to access light (Coomes, Lines, &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Laurance, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), consequently increasing the mean potential tree size within the community (e.g. Laurance et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) and to favour fast‐growing trees, potentially leading to communities with lower wood density.
