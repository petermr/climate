<p>Interpreting potential shifts in tropical floristic composition and linking them with possible drivers is a considerable challenge due to the very high diversity of tropical forests and their large spatial extent. However, if sufficient high‐quality, long‐term floristic monitoring is available, then the approach of analysing shifts in a suite of functional traits to describe how communities change over time can be used to link floristic changes to their drivers (McGill, Enquist, Weiher, &amp; Westoby,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). For tropical tree species, two largely independent trait axes may have value in addressing these questions. One axis, the life‐history trade‐off between growth and mortality, can be represented by wood density as it is negatively correlated to growth and mortality rates. This is a reflection of slow‐growing trees tending to invest more in wood structure (Chave et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The other axis is related to the potential size that taxa can attain, representing the capacity of taxa to compete for light (Falster &amp; Westoby,
