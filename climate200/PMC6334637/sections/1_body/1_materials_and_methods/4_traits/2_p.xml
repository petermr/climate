<p>We describe Amazonian tree genera in terms of the three basic traits shown in previous work and in Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> for our data to represent largely independent axes of fundamental plant characteristics and each potentially responsive to environmental change: Potential Size (PS; cm): the 95th percentile of the distribution of trees’ diameter derived from a set of 530 inventory plots across the Amazon Basin (Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>); Water deficit affiliation (WDA; mm): derived from relative abundances across 513 inventory plots distributed along a large gradient of MCWD across the Western Neotropics (Esquivel‐Muelbert, Baker, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). This metric quantifies the preferred dry season severity for each taxon and is calculated as the dry season severity (measured as MCWD) where a taxon occurs weighted by the taxon's relative abundance in each location (Esquivel‐Muelbert, Baker, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Taxa affiliated to dry conditions show the most negative values of WDA, while the most wet‐affiliated ones have values of WDA equal to zero; Wood density (WD; g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>): values were extracted from the Wood Density Database (Chave et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0116" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). There was no indication of any pairwise relationship among any of the traits: WDA versus PS (
