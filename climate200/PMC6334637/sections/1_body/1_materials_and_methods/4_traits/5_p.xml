<p>Then, to obtain a census‐level value for each of the three traits, we scaled the genus‐level traits to the community level by calculating the community‐weighted mean (CWM sensu Diaz et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) for each trait in each census. For each of the 743 censuses across 106 plots, the CWM of each of these components was calculated as the mean trait value across the genera of the community, weighted by (a) the number of stems; and (b) the total basal area occupied by each genus. Community‐weighted means were calculated for the whole community and for each component of forest dynamics, that is the recruits (new trees that reach the 10 cm D cut‐off after each census interval), losses (those trees that died within each census interval) and the basal area gain of those trees that survived the census interval (Figure
