<p>Finally, we calculated the trends in abundance for four Amazonian functional types defined by Fyllas, Quesada, and Lloyd (
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) using trait information from a subset of the Amazonian species included in this study. The four Amazonian functional groups (small pioneers, small‐statured nonpioneers, tall pioneers and tall nonpioneers) are based on variety of foliar and structural traits (Supporting Information Appendix
