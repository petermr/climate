<p>To explore the potential impact of climate changes on functional change, we tested whether changes in the community are related to changes in climate. First, we calculated the linear trend in MCWD and MCWD
 <sub>i</sub> over the inventory period for each plot. We then used Kendall's 
 <italic>Ï„</italic> coefficient to test for the correlation between linear slopes of change in CWMs (composition) and MCWD (climate) for each plot. For the cases where the correlation was significant, we fit an OLS linear regression with the trends in CWM as a function of trends in MCWD.
