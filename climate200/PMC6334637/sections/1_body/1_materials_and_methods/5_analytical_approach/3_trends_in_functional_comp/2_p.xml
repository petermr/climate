<p>We investigated functional trends for the different components of forest demography (i.e. whole tree community, recruits and trees that died—Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These functional trends were quantified using (a) the bootstrapped mean and 95% CI of plot level linear regression slopes of the community weighted mean (CWM) as a function of time, averaged across all plots; and (b) linear mixed effect models (LMM) of CWM as a function of time with plot identified as a random effect, using function

 <sc>r</sc> package 
 <italic>lme4</italic> (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). While the first approach provides information of the overall mean trend across all plots, in which the uncertainty estimate is derived using a nonparametric approach, the second approach gives an estimate of the trend over the whole time series (1985–2015), accounting for potential changes in which plots are analysed over different time windows along the 30‐year period.
