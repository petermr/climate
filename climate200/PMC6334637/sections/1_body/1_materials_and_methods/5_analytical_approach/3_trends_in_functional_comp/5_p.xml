<p>The variation in plot area and monitoring period may be expected to influence plot‐level trends as smaller plots and those monitored for shorter periods are more likely to be affected by stochastic phenomena, such as tree falls (Fisher, Hurtt, Thomas, &amp; Chambers, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). An empirical investigation of the impact of sampling effort (i.e. length of monitoring period and plot size) on our estimate showed that the variance is expected to scale as a function of the square root of plot area multiplied by the monitoring period (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Thus, to account for the noise attributed to sampling effort, we used the square root of plot area multiplied by the monitoring period as weights when calculating Amazon‐level mean and confidence intervals of the CWM slopes.
