<p>In other words, MCWD is an annual water deficit metric which takes into account both the length and intensity of the dry season based solely on climatic variables, that is, ignoring soil properties. The calculation of MCWD does not necessarily follow the calendar year, as for tropical forests in the northern hemisphere the annual dry season typically spans two calendar years (between October and March). Thus, the starting point, that is, when 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, was defined climatologically as the wettest month in the first year in the time series (i.e. 1985), rather than the first month of that calendar year.
