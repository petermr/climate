<p>The functional shifts observed here are mirrored by underlying floristic changes when our data are analysed in terms of discrete taxonomic units (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The genus‐level floristic shifts behind the significant changes detected (Tables 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) illustrates how functional responses result from actual floristic change across Amazonian communities. However, the relationships between traits and floristic shifts also show significant scatter, suggesting idiosyncratic responses of each taxon and the complexity of this highly diverse system.
