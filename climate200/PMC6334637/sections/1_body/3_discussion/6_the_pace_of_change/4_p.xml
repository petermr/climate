<p>This study provides the first Amazon‐wide picture of functional and floristic dynamics over the last 30 years. Models have predicted a strengthening of the dry season over the Amazon (Boisier, Ciais, Ducharne, &amp; Guimberteau, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Joetzjer, Douville, Delire, &amp; Ciais, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), and an increase in water‐stress as a consequence of rising temperature (Pokhrel, Fan, &amp; Miguez‐Macho, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). But there have been few attempts to account for changes in composition, which may modulate the whole forest ecological impact of ecophysiological drivers such as increasing vapour pressure deficit (Levine et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Sakschewski et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The velocity and the magnitude of compositional changes presented here should be considered in attempts to model the dynamics of these forests under future climate. Our results show that a slow shift towards a more dry‐affiliated Amazonia is underway. If such a floristic shift is substantial enough to increase the resilience of Amazon tree communities to future droughts, it will still come with a price in terms of tree biodiversity, as wet‐affiliated restricted taxa represent the majority of Amazonian tree flora (Esquivel‐Muelbert, Baker, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Furthermore, although our results demonstrate that changes in composition are possible, the inertia intrinsic to these communities means that they will substantially lag behind climate change. Droughts are continuing to impact the basin (Erfanian et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Jiménez‐Muñoz et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). If this lag persists, intact Amazonian forests may be increasingly dominated by sub‐optimally adapted trees in terms of their preferred climate space, potentially threatening the ability of these ecosystems to provide key services such as protecting biodiversity and sequestering and storing carbon.
