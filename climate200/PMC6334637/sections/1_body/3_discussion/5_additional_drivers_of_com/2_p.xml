<p>Larger trees have greater competitive capacity and are anticipated to gain disproportionately with additional resources (Coomes et al.,

 <sub>2</sub> potentially provides a parsimonious explanation for the observed relative increase in large‐tree genera (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). If the increase in atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) is stimulating plant growth or increasing water‐use efficiency, then taxa that tend to compete better for light, notably larger trees (Poorter et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), are likely to gain a greater competitive advantage (Falster &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Although further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis, our results show an increase in basal area of large‐statured taxa (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and a decrease in abundance of small‐statured taxa (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10</xref>), both consistent with the expectations from increased competition. Additionally, the relative increase of larger genera is also observed in the broader dataset including the fringes of Amazonia (

 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary material</xref>), which supports the inference of a ubiquitous driver of compositional change. Our observations are also in line with a series of stand‐level studies that show increases in above‐ground biomass, growth, mortality and recruitment across Amazonia—all trends expected as an outcome from increased atmospheric CO
