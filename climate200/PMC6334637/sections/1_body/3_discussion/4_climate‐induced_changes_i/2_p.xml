<p>We detected an increase in the abundance of drought‐tolerant genera across Amazonia when analysing the recruitment and mortality within tree communities (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that tree communities are responding to the changes in climate. Our large‐scale results are consistent with tree community shifts towards more drought‐tolerant taxa reported in some neotropical (Butt et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Enquist &amp; Enquist, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Feeley, Silman, et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and west African forest localities (Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), and some temperate localities (McIntyre et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Across Amazonia we find that greater mortality of wet‐affiliated taxa over time is related to the degree to which water stress has increased within each community, providing direct evidence of the influence of climate on community dynamics (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This only emerged when analysing trends in basal area, indicating that it is driven by the increase in mortality of large wet‐affiliated trees. Indeed, large trees are expected to suffer the most under drought conditions by being more vulnerable to embolism, and thus more likely to die from hydraulic failure under drought stress (McDowell &amp; Allen, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Rowland et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In addition, further supporting the conclusion that this reflects concerted, widespread changes in Amazon forest mortality, we also found an increase in the potential size of the dead trees when analyses were repeated considering each cluster of neighbouring plots as a single sample unit (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly we find losses in stem‐based WD to be negatively correlated to changes in climate (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>), which suggests that WD may not be a good proxy of drought vulnerability.
