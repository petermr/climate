<p>Our results also suggest that other drivers are causing compositional shifts in Amazon forests. For example, although we did observe an increase in mortality of large, wet affiliated trees, consistent with the effect of the 2005 drought (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), our analyses also show a slight increase in the basal area of potentially large tree genera across the basin. These results contradict the expectations that droughts would preferably impact larger trees but are in line with the suggestion that smaller‐statured trees are more vulnerable to droughts as they have shallower roots than larger‐statured trees (Condit et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Fauset et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Wright, 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0113" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>). Most likely, it appears that the increase in mortality of large trees in some areas of the basin (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>) is a consequence of drought events such as the 2005 drought (cf. Bennett et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), but that it this mortality has been insufficient to counter a longer‐term tendency towards increased basal area of large‐statured taxa across Amazonia.
