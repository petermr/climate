<p>The floristic changes represented by the linear trends in abundance for individual genera are generally consistent with the functional changes observed. There have been notable increases in the relative abundance of the dry‐affiliated genera 
 <italic>Bertholletia</italic>,
 <italic> Brosimum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudolmedia</italic>, together with sharp decreases for the wet‐affiliated 
 <italic>Aparisthmium</italic>,
 <italic> Fusaea, Inga</italic> and 
 <italic>Mezilaurus</italic>. Some large‐statured genera have increased significantly, such as 
 <italic>Mora, Couratari</italic> and 
 <italic>Eschweilera</italic>. A decrease in smaller‐statured taxa, such as 
 <italic>Ouratea, Aniba, Marlierea</italic> and 
 <italic>Astrocaryum</italic> is also observed (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). Palms (Arecaceae) have significantly declined in abundance (Supporting Information Appendix 
 <xref rid="gcb14413-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>) overall, with marked declines of 
 <italic>Oenocarpus</italic> and 
 <italic>Astrocaryum</italic>, even though the hyperdominant palm genus 
 <italic>Euterpe</italic> has significantly increased in abundance across the basin.
