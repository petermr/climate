<p id="Par10">The growth rate and yield may also diverge within the Y strategy such that high yields are achieved with different growth rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although in-situ growth rate is an emergent property, the maximum potential growth rate (
 <italic>µ</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) is a genome-encoded trait that may be distinct for individual taxa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. There is some evidence for a rapid growth, low yield strategy characterised by enhanced metabolism, large cell sizes, high ribosomal production, and high maximum growth rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the strength of the growth rate-yield tradeoff is somewhat inconsistent across individual, population, and community levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Overall, we argue that high yield is a coherent, trait-based strategy whereas high growth rate results from combining any strategy with the right environmental conditions.
