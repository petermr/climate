<p id="Par11">Our resource acquisition strategy replaces the plant competitor strategy because microbial competition is mainly over resources. In fact, one could also argue this is true for plants [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The level of investment in extracellular enzyme production often reflects substrate status (quality and quantity) of the local environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Wood et al.’s foraging traits can readily be assimilated into our resource acquisition strategy. However, contrary to Wood et al.’s hypothesis that investment in resource acquisition traits is higher in resource abundant environments like the rhizosphere, we propose that this strategy will prevail in low-resource conditions where microbes would be under selection to increase resource capture at the expense of growth yield. It is also likely that organisms have acquisition strategies that are either uptake optimised (when precursors compounds are readily available in the environment, like in rhizosphere soil or less intensively managed grassland soils) or depolymerisation optimised (when resources are scarce and complex, like in cropland soils) or a combination of both [
