<p id="Par5">Following on existing ecological theory, microbial ecologists have proposed trait-based classifications of microorganisms. The copiotroph-oligotroph continuum was proposed as analogous to the r- and K-selection theory for plants and animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Such a classification was mostly based on microbial substrate preferences, trophic strategy and growth rates and has since been widely applied in various environmental contexts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Several recent efforts have also applied C-S-R life history strategies to microbial systems, particularly in the context of anthropogenic environmental change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Ho et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] classified methane-oxidising bacteria into C-S-R life strategies based on activity, recovery from disturbances, substrate utilisation patterns and stress tolerance. Krause et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] later generalised the same framework for all bacteria while emphasising that additional experiments would be needed to verify the microbial strategies and their underlying traits. Wood et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] justified a microbial C-S-R classification based on different traits derived from predicted functional datasets aimed at assessing the impact of cadmium and influence of the rhizosphere on microbial community assembly. These efforts at applying trait-based concepts in microbial ecology justify additional theory development and experimental evidence to validate the C-S-R framework in microbial ecology.
