<p id="Par12">We adopt Grime’s stress tolerance strategy with little modification because it aligns well across plants and microbes. Soil microbes experience a variety of stressors that change their physio-chemical environment and to which they respond through physiological and evolutionary mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Specific traits for stress tolerance depend on the kind of abiotic stress experienced by microbial communities. Regardless of the form of stress imposed, certain global patterns in phenotypic expression are common, including σ factors or molecular chaperons aimed to minimise or mitigate biomolecular damage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In cases such as high acidity or salinity, microbes employ various strategies to maintain cellular integrity and osmotic balance through changes in the structure and composition of cell envelopes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Under drought scenarios, stress tolerance strategies involve production of osmolytes like trehalose and glycine betaine or synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)—usually polysaccharides—to protect cells from desiccation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Thus, microbes exposed to suboptimal abiotic conditions would possess traits linked to stress tolerance at the expense of other traits.
