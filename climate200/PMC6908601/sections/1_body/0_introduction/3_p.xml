<p id="Par3">Life history strategies represent sets of traits that tend to correlate due to physiological or evolutionary tradeoffs, with different strategies favoured under different environmental conditions. For example, metabolic investments in degradative enzyme production for resource acquisition can reduce the efficiency of cellular growth [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, stress tolerance traits can tradeoff against investment in resource acquisition and growth yield [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although some stress tolerance mechanisms may have collateral benefits, the costs must generally be paid at the expense of other physiological processes if resources are limited. Ultimately, microbial metabolic investments and the resulting tradeoffs among traits linked to growth yield, resource acquisition and stress tolerance determine the contribution of microbial processes to ecosystem level carbon fluxes. Thus, information on these microbial traits should be useful in linking microbial processes with ecosystem carbon fluxes [
