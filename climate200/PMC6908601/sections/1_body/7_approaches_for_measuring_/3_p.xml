<p id="Par16">At the community level, traits integrate tradeoffs across phylogenetically undifferentiated populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Spatial competition, priority effects and other community level processes will also structure populations and affect processes. Community-aggregated measurements have the potential to predict microbial processes that drive ecosystem fluxes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, such aggregated traits obtained through simple summation of individual taxon traits may not reflect real process rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Quantifying phenotypic traits directly using physiological assays can help overcome this issue.
