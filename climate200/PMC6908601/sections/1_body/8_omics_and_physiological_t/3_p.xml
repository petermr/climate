<p id="Par19">Resource acquisition traits have been estimated with omics and biochemical techniques at both the population and community levels (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Extracellular enzyme assays provide estimates of microbial enzyme activity and the potential to degrade various complex substrates. Genes and transcripts encoding these enzymes can also be predicted from omics datasets. In addition, there is growing interest in linking Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database genes to microbial substrate degradation and resource acquisition potential. The CAZy database includes genes that code for enzymes that synthesise and break down complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. For example, glycoside hydrolases (GH) are involved in plant cell wall degradation and act on glycosidic bonds between carbohydrates or between carbohydrates and non-carbohydrate moieties [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In soils with lower resource availability, GH genes are expected to be more diverse and abundant, potentially leading to higher GH enzyme activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Once the complex polymers are degraded into simpler molecules, they are taken up by transporters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A variety of transporters, particularly the ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC-transporters), with differential substrate specificity can also be predicted from omics datasets. Greater investment in uptake transporters has been observed in root-associated microorganisms with plentiful substrates allowing the cells to reduce investment into extracellular enzyme production and increase their growth yield [
