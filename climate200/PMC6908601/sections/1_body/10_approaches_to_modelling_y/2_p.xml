<p id="Par23">Previously, functional groups have been incorporated into ecosystem models like the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilisation (MIMICS) model to predict the biogeochemical response of soil organic matter decomposition and stabilisation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this model, copiotrophic and oligotrophic functional groups represent fast-growing low yield and slow-growing high yield strategists, respectively. However, traits for acquisition of complex resources and tolerance to abiotic stressors are difficult to incorporate into the copiotrophic-oligotrophic dichotomy [
