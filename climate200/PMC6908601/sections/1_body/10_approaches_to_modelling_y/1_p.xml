<p id="Par22">Representing microbial diversity has been a big challenge for models projecting ecosystem responses to environmental change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This challenge introduces uncertainty that affects model predictions of future climatic change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Such uncertainties imply a need for better mechanistic models, and improved representation of microbial diversity and physiology could increase the accuracy of projected soil carbon fluxes. Although helpful, taxonomic information has limited utility in predicting ecosystem processes without information about the functional traits of the taxa present in a community. This decoupling arises due to various confounding factors such as functional redundancy, dormancy, phenotypic plasticity, etc. associated with the complexity of microbial characteristics across space and time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Thus, focussing on life history strategies arising from the interactions between microbial populations and the environment should help better link microbial ecology with ecosystem pools and fluxes.
