<p>To examine the effect of land on the spatial scales in the hydrological cycle, we use the ICON model. Two different simulations are conducted: one, following the AMIP protocol (Gates, 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>), with land and prescribed sea surface temperature (SST—will be referred to hereafter as ICON‐AMIP) and another without land (aqua‐planet; Wan et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and prescribed SST (will be referred to hereafter as ICON‐aqua). For each configuration (AMIP or aqua‐planet) 10 years of simulations are conducted. The simulations are conducted with 47 vertical levels. The ICON grid R2B04 is used, which has an effective resolution of 157.8 km (Zängl et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
