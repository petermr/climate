<p>While CMIP data are entirely model based, reanalysis data provide an observationally constrained dataset of the hydrological cycle. We use 40 years (1979–2018) of reanalysis data from ECMWF Era‐Interim and NCEP‐DOE 2. The spatial resolution of the 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> fields from the ECMWF data is 1°×1°, while from NCEP it is T63 (less than 2°).
