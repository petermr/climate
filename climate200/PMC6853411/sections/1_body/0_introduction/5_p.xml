<p>On a large spatial scale, once the divergence term becomes small enough, precipitation changes would be equivalent to the evaporation changes. In equilibrium, both precipitation and evaporation are strongly constrained by the energy budget and are expected to be small (2â€“3%/K; Allen &amp; Ingram, 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). This implies the existence of a shift in the relative importance of the different water budget terms for precipitation changes. The objective of this study is to identify this water budget breakdown scale and to examine whether indeed it constrains the scale of changes in precipitation under climate change.
