<p>The divergence of water vapor becomes inefficient with increasing spatial scales and vanishes on the global scale. Based on this argument and equationÂ 
 <xref rid="grl59514-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>, it is predicted that local changes in precipitation (due to any forcing) would be driven by changes in evaporation or water vapor divergence. The latter can be induced by both changes in atmospheric circulation, driving changes in air mass divergence, or water vapor capacity, driving changes in div (

 </sub>), even for a given air mass divergence (Mitchell et al., 
 <xref rid="grl59514-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>). We note that changes of the dynamics/thermodynamics of the atmosphere that would change the advection of water vapor without causing any change to the divergent term or to the evaporation will not directly affect the precipitation changes.
