<p>With a changing climate, precipitation will also change. On a global scale, those changes are expected to be relatively small due to small changes in evaporation (recalling that in steady‐state changes in precipitation and evaporation are constrained by the energy budget of the atmosphere‐surface system; Allen &amp; Ingram,

However, local precipitation changes are not well constrained by changes in evaporation, as local changes in water vapor convergence (due to circulation changes or water vapor amount changes) can contribute significantly. We propose that this simple argument suggests that there must exist a breakdown scale of the water budget constraint on precipitation—
