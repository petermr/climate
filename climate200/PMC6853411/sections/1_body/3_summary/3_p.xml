<p>Using two different reanalysis data sets, 39 CMIP5 models and additional global simulations, we show that 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> depends on the degree to which the water budget is closed, but has a similar behavior and magnitude between the different models and reanalysis data sets. If required that the water budget is closed to &lt;10% (allowing small divergence term contributions to precipitation changes), 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> ≈ 3,500–4,000 km, below which changes in precipitation are not constrained by the small changes in evaporation. This scale is not expected to significantly change under global warming (Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
