<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> demonstrates that the water budget is locally closed once averaged radially over a few 1,000 km (74% of the precipitation in our region of interest [−40 to 40°] falls in a region in which the local water budget is closed to within 10% on 4,000‐km scale). However, the exact value depends on the degree of closure, that is, to within what percent 
 <italic>P</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> are similar (a perfect 
 <italic>P</italic>=
 <italic>E</italic> is achieved only on the global scale). Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents the mean (over −40 to 40° latitudes) scale at which the water budget is locally close (
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub>) for different degrees of closure for all the different data sets and models. All different models and reanalysis data sets demonstrate a monotonic decrease in 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> as the level of closer becomes larger and (except the ICON_aqua) are within ~20% from one another (for a given degree of closure). Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> also demonstrates that 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> does not significantly change with climate change (i.e., similar trends for the historical and RCP8.5 simulations). The ICON_aqua simulation demonstrates a larger sensitivity of 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub> to the level of closure. Since the patterns of 
 <italic>P</italic> − 
 <italic>E</italic> in the aqua‐planet simulation are zonally symmetric (no emerging features at the east parts of the oceans; see Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), it requires larger spatial scales to get to a strict water budget closure (e.g., to within 2.5%). However, as the zonal stripes of net 
 <italic>P</italic> and net 
 <italic>E</italic> are located one next to the other, large fraction of the globe requires only relatively small spatial scale averaging to get to a loose closure (e.g., to within 15%). Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents the mean scale (
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>WB</italic>
 </sub>) between −40 to 40° latitudes. However, as can be seen from Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, there exist spatial variations in this scale. Figure 
 <xref rid="grl59514-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> in the 
 <xref rid="grl59514-supinf-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">supporting information</xref> presents the average scale over land and ocean separately, as well as the average scale including higher latitudes. In addition, we note that averaging separately in the zonal and meridional directions (rather than radially) will result in a different length scale, as, for example, at latitudes of net precipitation (deep tropics or high latitudes) or at latitudes of net evaporation (subtropics) zonal averaging will not result in a closure of the water budget even once averaged over all longitudes.
