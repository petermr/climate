 <caption> Plant species extinctions and subsequent coextinction cascades for each pollination network across the two time horizons. Each panel compares the direct loss of species induced by climate change versus the same amount plus the subsequent coextinction cascades for 2050 and 2080. As in Fig. 1, the different colors identify the specific networks, with the darker and lighter colors representing the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian networks, respectively. For visualization purposes, different points are slightly displaced across the x axis when they overlap. Figure shows the average and SD fraction of species lost across 1000 replicates. </caption>
