  <title>Plant species extinctions and subsequent coextinction cascades for each pollination network across the two time horizons.</title>
  <p>Each panel compares the direct loss of species induced by climate change versus the same amount plus the subsequent coextinction cascades for 2050 and 2080. As in 
   <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the different colors identify the specific networks, with the darker and lighter colors representing the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian networks, respectively. For visualization purposes, different points are slightly displaced across the 
   <italic>x</italic> axis when they overlap. Figure shows the average and SD fraction of species lost across 1000 replicates.
