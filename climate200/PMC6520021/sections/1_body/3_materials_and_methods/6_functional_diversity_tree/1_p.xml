<p>The functional tree of plants was constructed by applying the Sorensen distance (
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>56</italic>
 </xref>) (S7 coefficient of Gower and Legendre, function 
 <italic>dist.ktab</italic> in library 
 <italic>ade4</italic>) to the plant functional traits. This creates the distance matrix that is used to generate the tree. For that purpose, we used hierarchical clustering to build the most reliable dendrogram of all species in functional trait space using the complete linkage method (function 
 <italic>hclust</italic>) (
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>57</italic>
 </xref>). Species with unknown information for any of the traits were discarded, which reduced the tree to 179 species of the 244 original ones. As with the phylogeny, species in multiple networks were included more than once and emerged as polytomies in the functional tree (207 tip data).
