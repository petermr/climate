<p>Species distribution models were calibrated using current climatic information from the WorldClim database (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>29</italic>
 </xref>) at a 10–arc min resolution. Current climate was represented by five different bioclimatic variables: temperature seasonality (within-year SD × 100; bio 4), maximum temperature of the warmest month (bio 5), minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio 6), precipitation of the wettest month (bio 13), and precipitation of the driest month (bio 14). These variables were previously shown to present little multicollinearity in the study area (

 </xref>). Species distributions were projected according to different future climatic scenarios represented by several RCM runs generated by the ENSEMBLES EU project, which downscaled the very coarse resolution GCMs’ climatic data obtained for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>31</italic>
 </xref>). Specifically, we used three different RCMs (HadRM3, RCA3, and RACMO2) (

  <italic>32</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>35</italic>
 </xref>) downscaled from three different GCMs (HadCM3, ECHAM5, and CCSM3). We also considered three different SRESs available for these models (A1b, A2, and B1) (

 </xref>). All combinations of RCM/GCM/SRES scenarios were interpolated to the same 10–arc min resolution.
