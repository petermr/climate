<p>Our statistical analyses reveal that while geographic location is the best predictor of the probability of climatically driven extinctions (table S3), network identity is a substantially better predictor of the ultimate fate of a species through the combined effect of climatically induced extinctions and subsequent coextinctions (ΔAIC &gt; 4.27 in the two time horizons; table S4). This provides strong evidence that information about the network of mutual dependencies among species is key when assessing the response of communities—rather than that of isolated species—to climate change.</p>
