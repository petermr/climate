<p>Although information about the pollinators is much too scarce to run species distribution models, we can perform a similar analysis on the insect coextinction cascades resulting from plant extinctions and coextinctions. After building a phylogeny for all the insects present in the seven pollinator networks (fig. S8), we repeated our model selection analyses for the best predictor of insect coextinction. In strong agreement with the patterns found in plants, our results show that the local network of interactions provides a better predictor of the joint risk of extinction and coextinction than biogeographic information at both time horizons (table S7). In addition, there is a significant phylogenetic signal in the combined extinctions and coextinctions for the time horizon 2050 (λ = 0.24; AIC is lower than the equivalent when λ is forced to 0; table S7). This signal, however, is absent in 2080, which again seems to suggest a decrease in our ability to predict species vulnerability based on phylogenetic information with the length of the temporal horizon.</p>
