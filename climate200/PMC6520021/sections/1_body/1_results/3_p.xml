<p>Besides the apparent major differences between Mediterranean and Eurosiberian networks, there is also some variability in coextinction rates across the Eurosiberian networks for the time horizon of 2080. This observation leads us to the more general question of assessing what are the best correlates predicting the fate of species. To answer this question, we compared the explanatory power of several models that predict climatically induced species extinctions on one hand and extinctions resulting from the combined effect of climate and subsequent coextinctions on the other hand based on phylogenetic information [phylogenetic signal was quantified by optimizing Pagel’s λ, which varies between 0 and 1 and quantifies the extent to which resemblance between species reflects their evolutionary history as approximated by Brownian motion (

We then compared candidate models using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC; see Materials and Methods and tables S3 to S7).
