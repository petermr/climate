<p>As 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> demonstrates, there is quite a broad range of biogeographical variability in the rate of species extinctions. The two Mediterranean networks (dark blue and brown circles in 
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) are the ones experiencing a higher rate of extinction. The difference is much higher, however, when considering the subsequent coextinctions. This suggests that the Mediterranean networks may be much more vulnerable to climate change than the Eurosiberian ones, albeit our sample size is too small to make a general claim. This would be expected primarily not only because climate change is assumed to be greater in Mediterranean zones (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>) but also because Mediterranean networks contain plant species with narrower distribution ranges (
 <italic>t</italic> = 19.1, df = 277, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, two sample 
 <italic>t</italic> test) and therefore a higher probability of extinction as predicted by species distribution models. This higher extinction probability pushes the network closer to the threshold of collapse as identified by previous papers on the fragility of ecological networks (
