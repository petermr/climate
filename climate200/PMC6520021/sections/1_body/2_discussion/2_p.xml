<p>We have shown that considering the network of interdependencies among species is relevant when predicting extinction risk in the face of climate change. Incorporating species interactions not only increases the pool of species most likely being driven to extinction but also changes the way extant species are selected from the evolutionary and functional trees with potential implications for the functioning and robustness of the resulting communities.</p>
