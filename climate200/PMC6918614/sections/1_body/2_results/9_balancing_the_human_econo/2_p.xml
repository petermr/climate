<p id="Par69">Despite some overall consistency, considerable differences were evident between jurisdictions, driven by the application of different values, about 
 <italic>which interests</italic> should be prioritised. For example environment sector plans in the geographically small and landlocked Australian Capital Territory (ACT) referred to three primary water uses: 
 <italic>Conservation, Water Supply, and Drainage and Open Space</italic>. Within each of these categories, a number of secondary uses were permitted provided that they were generally compatible with the primary uses. Such secondary uses included recreation (fishing, boating, swimming). Positioning fishing as a secondary use makes it less important than conservation of waterway ecosystems and biodiversity. It is important to note though because the ACT is landlocked its policies do not govern ocean fishing.
