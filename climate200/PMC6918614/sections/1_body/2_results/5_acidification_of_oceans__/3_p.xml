<p id="Par49">The few strategies outlined to address ocean acidification in the Plan include repeated water sampling to provide “
 <italic>Reef managers with information on where, when and how ocean acidification is affecting the Reef</italic>” (page 61), and continued “
 <italic>constructive participation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol; through practical cooperation with regional partner countries; and through supporting developing countries to take actions that reduce emissions”</italic> (page 61). The Government also committed to a modest objective of reducing emissions to “
 <italic>five per cent below 2000 levels by the year 2020</italic>” (page 61) (that is over a period of 5 years as the Plan was released in 2015). If that reduction were achieved it would represent a 19% decrease in emissions from the levels previously 
 <italic>projected</italic> for 2020, rather than an 
 <italic>actual</italic> decrease of 19%. As such, these strategies do not match the magnitude nor urgency of the problem of acidification that is conveyed in the problem framing statements, and their likely effectiveness in tackling further acidification, and health implications of this, is doubtful.
