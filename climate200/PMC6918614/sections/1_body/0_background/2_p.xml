<p id="Par5">Australia currently ranks highly in terms of environmental performance globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However the 
 <italic>Australia: State of the Environment 2016</italic> reports emphasised that if current environmental trends continue, the Australian natural environment will have deteriorated significantly by 2050 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The main pressures on the Australian environment are resulting from climate change, unsustainable land use and habitat degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Australia is one of the worldâ€™s most resource and carbon intensive countries, contributing to depletion of finite resources and climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The detrimental effects of climate change in Australia (including rising temperatures, fluctuating climates, and rainfall changes) are becoming increasingly evident, as is a reduction in groundwater quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Biodiversity across ecosystems is also poor and worsening [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recently Australia has experienced increased drought, a decline in the numbers of pollinators, and more regular extreme storms, which undermine food production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Some crops are also becoming less nutritious due to atmospheric and soil changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Rising sea levels, ongoing demand for coastal land and severe weather events increase pressure on coasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pollution in Australian oceans is increasing, and climate change is warming and acidifying ocean waters, compromising marine ecosystem stability and diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All of these trends also threaten human well-being, particularly by increasing the risk of natural disasters and detrimental climate changes, while potentially reducing access to clean air, safe drinking water and adequate food resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such threats may lead to increased chronic and acute disease, particularly type 2 diabetes, obesity and overweight as well as cancers, heart disease and cardiovascular diseases, and reduced life expectancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With natural systems currently being degraded to an extent that is unprecedented in human history, both in Australia and around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], there is an immediate need for action.
