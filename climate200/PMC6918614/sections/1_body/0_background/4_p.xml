<p id="Par7">Our research critically examined Australian governments’ environment sector policies and the extent to which they do or do not address social determinants of health and health equity (SDH/HE). In this paper we draw on findings from the research to: a) examine whether and how the goals, objectives, strategies and values expressed in Australian environment sector policy and legislation documents will support action toward achieving three SDGs: 6, 13 and 14 (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); and b) consider the implications of such actions (or inaction) for health and health equity. The three SDGs have been selected because they are directly related to the core business of government environment departments. However, it is recognised in our research and in World Health Organisation documents on the SDGs, including the 
 <italic>Global Action Plan: Healthy Lives and Well-being for All 2019</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], that environmental goals (and all goals) in the SDGs have clear links to the social determinants that influence human health, well-being and equity.
