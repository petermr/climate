<p id="Par84">While Australia currently has relatively high quality drinking water and sanitation systems, the water related threats to human health presented by continued environmental degradation and worsened climate change are concerning. Such threats include restricted availability of adequate, clean river flows, food insecurity and potential increases in floods and the resulting social dislocation. A planetary health perspective stresses the importance of optimising governance systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The findings highlight a need across jurisdictions for a more cohesive, coordinated national approach to preserve water and sanitation standards and offset threats. Australian governments already invest in a coordinated approach, developed and administered through the Council of Australian Governments. Under the framework of the National Water Initiative, successive governments across Australia have also been working on a water reform agenda, which has the scope to improve coordination. To protect Australiaâ€™s water supply and sanitation as determinants of health it is imperative that this type of work continue, and be sustained over the 
 <italic>long term</italic>, resisting the damaging impacts of short-sighted political visions and jurisdictional power battles that have impeded past reform efforts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, given that the research findings show continued fragmentation in water system management across the country, work must also be undertaken to examine 
 <italic>why</italic> this is, and how broader adoption of consistent approaches can be facilitated to optimise use of the resources being invested in the national approach. Water reform work must also address the inequalities in secure water access that have emerged between rural and metropolitan systems to ensure that the SDG aspiration of water and sanitation 
 <italic>for all</italic> can be realised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and that policies on water do not exacerbate existing health inequities between city and country regions in Australia. This is particularly important to support the well-being and health equity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in very remote country areas.
