<p>The thermal restriction zone that protects mammals is the difference between their high basal temperatures and the environmental temperatures. Human-induced climate change is anticipated to warm Earth by several degrees in the 21st century, which will reduce the magnitude of the gradient between ambient temperatures and mammalian basal temperatures (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Consequently, there is concern that higher ambient temperatures will lead to the selection of fungal lineages to become more thermally tolerant, such that they can breach the mammalian thermal restriction zone. In this regard, experiments with an entomopathogenic fungus have shown that these can be rapidly adapted to growth at higher temperatures by thermal selection (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), establishing a precedent for an animal-pathogenic fungus adapting to mammalian basal temperatures. Most worrisome, analysis of thermal tolerances for fungal isolates deposited in a culture collection showed a trend of basidiomycetes for an increased capacity to replicate at higher temperatures, an observation consistent with an early adaptation to higher ambient temperatures beginning in the late 20th century (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Supporting the notion of adaptation in response to temperature, fungal species in cities have become more thermotolerant than their rural counterparts (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). An analysis of the correlation of temperature tolerance with latitude (for strains isolated in recent decades and described in reference 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) showed that the Pearson correlations between the maximum temperature growth of all fungi, ascomycetes (e.g., 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Histoplasma</italic> spp., etc.), and basidiomycetes (e.g., 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp., etc.) were −0.14619, −0.054638414, and −0.304251976, respectively. The lack of a significant trend for the ascomycetes is consistent with the fact that this group can grow at higher ambient temperatures and can thus grow across the latitudes. For the basidiomycetes, the borderline significant trend suggests that these are adapting to the warmer conditions in higher absolute latitudes, possibly because of climate warming, consistent with our earlier analysis (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Given the capacity of fungal species to adapt to higher temperatures and the fact that many fungal species that are currently nonpathogenic species are likely to have the necessary virulence attributes by virtue of their survival in soils, we previously hypothesized that climate change would bring new fungal diseases (
