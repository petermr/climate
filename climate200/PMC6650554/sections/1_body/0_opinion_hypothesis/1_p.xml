 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida auris</named-content> is a new drug-resistant fungal species that was first isolated in 2009 from a human ear and thus named “
 <italic>auris</italic>” (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Since then, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> has been associated with human disease in many countries, and the clinical isolates are remarkable for exhibiting nonsusceptibility to antifungal agents. One of the striking developments associated with the appearance of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content>-related disease is that pathogenic isolates appear to have emerged independently on three continents simultaneously (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Analysis of isolates recovered from the Indian subcontinent, Venezuela, and South Africa during 2012 to 2015 revealed that the isolates from each continent were clonal, but that those from different continents constituted genetically different clades (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The mechanism(s) responsible for the simultaneous emergence of three different clades of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> in three geographically distant regions are unexplained.
