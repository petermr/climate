<p>Whether 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> is the first example of new pathogenic fungi emerging from climate change or whether its origin into the realm of human-pathogenic fungi followed a different trajectory, its emanation stokes worries that humanity may face new diseases from fungal adaptation to hotter climates. Thus far, the majority of human cases of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content>-related disease have occurred in debilitated individuals, such as those in intensive care units. Because their debilitated conditions impair their immunity, this group may serve as sentinels for the appearance of new fungal diseases. Perhaps the greatest lesson from the emergence of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. auris</named-content> is the need for greater vigilance and continuous monitoring. In this regard, the environment is likely to contain large numbers of fungal species with pathogenic potential that are currently nonpathogenic for humans because they lack the ability to grow at mammalian temperatures. If anything, the direct and indirect effects of climate changes induced by an exponentially growing human population as drivers of fungal evolution should be an area of intense research in the decades to come. Widening of the geographic range of innately thermotolerant pathogenic fungi and the acquisition of virulence traits in thermotolerant nonpathogenic environmental fungi may shape the 21st century as an era of expanding fungal disease for both the fauna and flora of the planet.
