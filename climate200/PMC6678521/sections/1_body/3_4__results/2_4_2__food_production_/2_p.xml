<p>Climate conditions such as rainfall and temperature have a primary influence on food production through impacts on water yields and flows, which are often modulated by irrigation and other water management techniques [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other climate-related factors that can affect food production, and hence food security, include impacts on freshwater, biodiversity, soil degradation, fisheries, and carbon dioxide fertilization, with attendant impacts on nutritional food quality [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Some research suggests that climate change may create opportunities for Canadian food production [

 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For example, some regions in Canada may experience an increased growing season and lengthened outdoor feeding season for livestock, which could positively affect food production [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, climate projections suggest an increased risk of drought in some regions of Canada, including the Prairies and British Columbia. In addition, future impacts from invasive pests and diseases, and transportation disruptions could put pressures on Canadian food production [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-02531" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the global level, any positive effects resulting from a warming climate are expected to be significantly outweighed by their adverse effects on the food system [
