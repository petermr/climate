<p>Food processing involves the transformation of raw food inputs into food products that are used in the preparation of meals or directly consumed by individuals. The food processing sector has a direct link to human health as its operations include washing, sanitizing, and preparing food that is safe for human consumption. Limited research has been conducted on climate change impacts to the food processing sector, both globally and in the Canadian context. Existing evidence suggests that climate change impacts may cause disruption to the stable supply of necessary resources, and inputs for processing operations and extreme weather events can cause physical damage to processing facilities [
