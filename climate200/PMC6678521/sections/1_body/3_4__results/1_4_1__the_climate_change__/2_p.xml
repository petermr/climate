<p>The linkages and drivers between climate change, food security, and human health are presented in a new framework (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02531-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The framework illustrates the nexus from a food system perspective, highlighting the direct and indirect pathways in which the physical impacts of climate change may work through the food system to influence food security and, subsequently, human health. By identifying the different sectors of the food system, the framework demonstrates that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary for effective adaptation and resiliency building in response to climate change.
