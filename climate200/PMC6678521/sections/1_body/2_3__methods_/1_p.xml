<p>An analytical framework was developed to illustrate the complex relationship between climate change impacts and the food system, and how this relationship influences food security and human health in Canada. In order to appropriately capture the breadth of the climate change, food security, human health nexus, and the nuances of the relationship, multiple literature searches were conducted. The databases Medline and Embase were searched via Ovid between 2007 and September 2017. To understand the possible impacts of climate change on the Canadian food system and the subsequent implications for human health, four search strategies were developed in consultation with a research librarian at Health Canadaâ€™s Health Library: (1) climate change + food security + Canada, (2) climate change + food security + health, (3) food security + health + Canada, and (4) food systems + climate change + food security.</p>
