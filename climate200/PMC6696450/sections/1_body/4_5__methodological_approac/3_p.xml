<p>Laboratory studies allow testing individual and multiple stressors simultaneously and targeting specific endpoints or pathways to better understand how each stressor and their combination affect organisms’ responses. Although more ecologically realistic than single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify complex systems [
 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Laboratory studies can be viewed as a mechanistic approach to multi stressors testing, yet limited to organisms that can be kept in laboratory settings. Another limitation of these studies is their ecological relevance, given that they mainly focus on individual or sub-individual responses of model and a few non-model species, which can render different results. Furthermore, although differences in species’ sensitivities to ocean change stressors undoubtedly reflect different tolerance levels, inconsistent methodologies also play a significant part in different outcomes among studies [
