<p>The challenge to identify synergistic effects among climate change and pollution-related stressors is often associated with methodological limitations. While traditional ecotoxicological studies focused on the incremental effect of a pollutant on a particular biological organism, the complexity of experimental design, logistics, and data analysis of multiple-stressor studies notably increases with the number of stressors. Nevertheless, multiple approaches have been used for different levels of biological organization, such as experimental approaches for individual-based studies, to statistical modelling and trophic-dynamic ecosystem simulation model (e.g., Ecopath with Ecosim, EwE; see Reference [
