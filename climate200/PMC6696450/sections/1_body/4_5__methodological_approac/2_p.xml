<p>Experimental approaches to assess the combined impact of multiple drivers not only require assessing the effects of such drivers, but also testing more than two scenarios for each targeted category. Resolving the interaction between stressors requires obtaining performance curves for each individual driver, together with a better understanding of their mechanisms or mode of action. However, such performance curves for each scenario require more than two levels for each stressor, regardless of the stressor being temperature, ocean acidification, or concentration of a chemical pollutant.</p>
