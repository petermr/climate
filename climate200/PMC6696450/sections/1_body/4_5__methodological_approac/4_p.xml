<p>Exposure time can also be controlled in laboratory studies. In contrast, exposure time is much more complex to control in the field, and it is difficult to guarantee that exposure occurs simultaneously with the stressor. A popular option includes sampling organisms from nature, in different locations and seasons, and exposing them to multiple stressors in laboratory settings [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Researchers using this approach must carefully design their experiments to guarantee the appropriate control treatments, since sampling, transportation, and husbandry in controlled settings are likely to cause stress to the organism of interest. Another approach to addressing multiple stressorsâ€™ interactions between climate-change and pollutants is mesocosms studies (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B101-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]). They can be viewed as an intermediate design to laboratory and field-studies, or as a simplification of natural systems enabling mechanistic testing of single and multiple drivers in highly-replicable and controlled settings, and at ecologically relevant scales [
