<p>Field studies are also common, but identifying synergistic effects of climate change and pollution is a difficult challenge that often relies on powerful statistical tools [

 <xref rid="B104-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Additionally, it is often difficult to define baseline reference points and thresholds, as there is no control treatment in field studies. Such information is typically determined from comparisons to historical data-sets or by sampling other locations that can be used as reference. Expert opinion might also be used to help define model assumptions and interpret results [

Note that ecosystem-based modelling requires a great multi-disciplinary work to guarantee that all ecological indicators are accurately sampled and interpreted in complex marine coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, coral reefs, mangroves, among others. Ultimately, food web and trophic-dynamic ecosystem modelling, such as the Ecopath with Ecosism (EwE) model and the Ecotracer routine to track pollutant bioaccumulation under climate change forcing have also successfully been applied to assess and project simulations of the interactions of climate change impacts and pollutant bioaccumulation in the marine ecosystems [
