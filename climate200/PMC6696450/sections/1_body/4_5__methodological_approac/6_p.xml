 <xref rid="B110-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. DEB theory is a non-species specific theory at the organism level that describes and quantifies metabolic processes, such as the growth, development, and reproduction of organisms. The metabolic organization of the standard DEB model, which is applicable to animals that maintain their shape as they grow, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02737-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The biomass of the organism is composed by structure and reserve while the life-stage that controls the metabolic processes that the organism has access to is controlled by the level of maturity. Organisms increase their maturity until achieving first the level of maturity that triggers the feeding behavior and then the level of maturity that triggers the reproduction behavior. The mass and energy allocated by the organism to metabolic processes such as growth and maintenance depends on the state of the organism (maturity, reserve, and structure), on environmental variables, such as the amount of food and temperature, and on species-specific parameters, such as the specific assimilation rate, the volume specific somatic maintenance rate and the specific volume cost of growth among others (for a more detailed description of the equations and the parameters used in DEB theory see [
