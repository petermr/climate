<p>Climate change encompasses multiple physical and chemical changes in ocean conditions, including temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen concentration, ice coverage, and currents. These changes are also altering contaminants’ behavior in the marine environment, affecting its worldwide distribution and toxicity potential, thus reshaping the environmental impacts of marine chemical pollutants [

 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Accordingly, changes in seawater temperature, salinity, pH, and other environmental parameters have been associated with changes in fate and global cycling of chemical pollutants (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B66-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]), their bioaccumulation (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]) to marine organisms. Notwithstanding, chemical exposure may also lead to increased inability of organisms to cope with shifting environmental conditions linked to climate change. Following Alava et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] terminology, interactions between climate change and environmental chemicals can either be climate change-dominant (i.e., climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure or enhances organisms’ susceptibility to chemical toxicity), or contaminant-dominant (i.e., chemical exposure leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility). Resolving such complex interactions include discerning among antagonistic, additive or synergistic effects. Briefly, antagonistic effects describe an interaction where one stressor offsets the effect of the other; additive effects equal the sum of each stressor separate effects for the scenarios tested; and synergistic effects in which stressors interplay results in a combined effect greater than the sum of their individual effects [
 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A straightforward example is the impact of different climate changes or pollution stressors on the growth rate of a particular organism, which can equal the sum of the observed impacts of each driver alone (additive effects), it can present smaller (antagonistic effects), or greater outcomes regarding individual effects (synergistic effects). Przeslawski et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] performed a meta-analysis of the effects of multi-stressor studies targeting early marine life stages and described higher prevalence of synergistic interactions (ca. 65%) than additive (17%) or antagonistic (17%) interactions. Available studies mainly focused on combinations of temperature, salinity and acidification drivers, whilst interaction between these factors and pollutants are scarce for most taxa.
