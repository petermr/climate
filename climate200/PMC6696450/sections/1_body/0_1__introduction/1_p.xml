 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] outlined that no area was unaffected by human influence and that more than 40% of marine areas were strongly impacted by multiple pressures. The magnitude of human impacts has been higher in coastal zones compared to offshore areas, with climate change, fishing, and pollution being the most significant pressures [
