<p>Coastal ecosystems are also heavily affected by pollution. Human activities have introduced thousands of substances and/or materials in the marine environment that once above certain threshold values might present negative effects on biological components of these ecosystems and, therefore, become pollutants [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pollutants might originate from a large number of human activities (e.g., agriculture, industrial, urban and port development, transportation, fisheries and aquaculture, recreation) and may be of a different natureâ€”chemical (e.g., nutrients, biocides, metals, oil, pharmaceuticals), physical (e.g., plastic debris, large hard structures, temperature, radiation, noise), or biological (e.g., introduced non-indigenous species). The classification of pollutants is not, however, straightforward, since a certain element may be toxic (i.e., that can be poisonous or have negative physiological effects) and simultaneously introduce physical and biological changes (for example, a toxic plastic debris colonized by non-indigenous species). Pollutants may be introduced in marine coastal areas directly as discharges or solid wastes from land and human activities at sea, through the runoff of rivers (these being point-sources for the marine environment), or by exchanges with the atmosphere (non-point-source) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The relative contribution of these three pathways varies according to the type of pollutant, and its estimation is extremely difficult and uncertain due to the high spatial and temporal variation and to the lack of knowledge of several processes determining their exchanges and fate [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, pollutants incorporate biogeochemical cycles in these coastal areas, which introduce a high complexity to their quantification and their impacts assessment. Trends in coastal pollution are also extremely variable. While for certain geographical areas successful efforts have been made in order to reduce some pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls in the Baltic [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), in other zones and/or other contaminants increased pollution has been reported [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, several authors are very cautiousness in predictions relative to changes in coastal pollution, since it may be a result of the economic and technological development, for which future developments are difficult to predict [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among other pressures affecting coastal zones, several authors emphasize the relevance of habitat loss and non-indigenous species, with their magnitude being extremely different according to geographical area, although with documented impacts worldwide [
