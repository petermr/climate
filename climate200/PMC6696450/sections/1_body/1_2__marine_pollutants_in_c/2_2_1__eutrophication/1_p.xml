<p>Coastal eutrophication has dramatically increased in the past decades and is a widespread major problem that promotes several negative effects, among which hypoxia (concentrations of dissolved oxygen lower than 2 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) is usually the most detrimental one [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Eutrophication is mainly driven by nitrogen inputs, although phosphorus has also a major role in this process [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Reactive nitrogen loads resulting from human activities, especially the use of fertilizers, agriculture of N-fixing crops, and fossil fuel combustion, have grown exponentially since the 1960s [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite the flux of nitrogen to coastal areas may be due to several processes, river basins input is usually the main contributor, which is in turn related to landscape use (especially agricultural use) and river flow regime [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the worldwide distribution of coastal eutrophic areas with an associated oxygen depletion match with major population centers and watersheds that have the largest inputs of nutrients [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a global review on eutrophication, Diaz and Rosenberg [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] identified more than 400 coastal areas (covering more than 245,000 km²) for which hypoxia have been documented, it was found that its number has approximately doubled each decade since the 1960s. Regarding predictions on the evolution on coastal eutrophication, Howarth [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] outlined that since major sinks at the watershed and landscape levels are increasingly saturated, an increase in the input to coastal areas should be expected in the future. Nevertheless, a high level of uncertainty is still embedded in predictive modelling methodologies. According to Diaz and Rosenberg [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], hypoxia and anoxia are among the most widespread deleterious anthropogenic influences on estuarine and marine environments due to eutrophication. These authors further outline that dissolved oxygen in these environments have changed drastically over a short time, and that further expansion of hypoxic areas will largely depend on climate-related processes, namely water-column stratification and water basins runoff processes.
