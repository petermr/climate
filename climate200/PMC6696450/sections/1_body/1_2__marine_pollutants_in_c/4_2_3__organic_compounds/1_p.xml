<p>Organic pollutants comprise a huge variety of chemical species including both natural and synthetic substances [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Most of them present a high structural stability and bioaccumulation potential, and a long-range transport, and therefore often denominated persistent organic pollutants [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These pollutants originate in a wide diversity of human activities, namely the ones related to pest control in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, detergents, flame retardants, combustion by-products, di-electric fluids, among many others [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDE), organochlorine pesticides (OP), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCD), Dechlorane Plus (DP) and perfluoralkyl substances (PFAS) are some examples of these pollutants [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The majority of these compounds are highly toxic to biota and produce a wide range of metabolic responses, which may severely hamper physiological performance and survival (some are carcinogenic and/or endocrine disruptors). Several studies on trophic cascades based on estimates of organic pollutants have allowed to infer impacts at population, community, and ecosystem levels, but information on these aspects is still scarce (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). In regards to spatial and temporal patterns of contamination by these chemicals, some European and Asian coastal areas have been reported as having the highest concentrations, although studies are still lacking for wide geographical areas [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The assessment of their temporal variation on the basis of several monitoring programs using marine organisms (e.g., mollusks, fish, sea birds and mammals) as bioindicators have shown that some compounds, namely dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), PCB, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), PBDE decreased their concentrations in recent years, mainly in response to regulations, whereas others, such as HBCD and PFAS, have increased [
