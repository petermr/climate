<p>Besides effects at the individual level, community level impacts are also extremely relevant yet notably challenging to empirically assess. Nevertheless, micro- or mesocosms experimental approaches are a valid option to study the interactive effects of climate change and pollution at the community and ecosystem level. For instance, Coelho et al. [
 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] assessed the response of a marine microbial community to anthropogenic pollutants under an ocean acidification scenario. Results showed that the role that microbes play in biogeochemical cycles might be affected by the interactive effects of these two drivers. Unfortunately, this review identified a notable gap in the scientific literature for community-based studies identifying synergistic effects of climate change and pollution in coastal marine communities.
