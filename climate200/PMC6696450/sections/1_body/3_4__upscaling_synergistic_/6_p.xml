<p>It is also important to note that synergistic effects of climate change and pollution extend beyond consequences for marine animals. The combined effects of eutrophication and acidification have also been recorded for marine algae, particularly an accelerated growth of filamentous turfs [

 <xref rid="B92-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] show that the synergistic effect was 34% larger than the combined additive effect of each individual driver. The effect of eutrophication and climate warming has also been documented for macroalgae by GouvÃªa et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], who concluded that large-scale declines in macroalgal production, which previous studies identified as being driven by nitrogen limitation, might actually be driven by the synergistic effects of nitrogen limitation and elevated temperature.
