<p>The impacts of climate change and pollution have been thoroughly explored but mostly as independent stressors [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, the potential interactions between these stressors are still far from being clear [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This is mostly driven by the great diversity of stressor pairs that are likely to occur in marine coastal environments. Nevertheless, a growing number of studies assessing the interactive effect of multiple climate change and pollution stressors on marine organisms has been recently published [
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It is also important to note that most studies use individual-based approaches [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], but there are also more holistic studies assessing community responses [
 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-16-02737" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].
