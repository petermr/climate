<p>Future research should try to include more stressors in order to have a more holistic and comprehensive perspective of interactions, but in a more aggregated way, and try to combine within a same cluster certain habitats, taxa, contaminants, and pressures, among others. Considering a multitude of policy-driven targets and aims, research should also be directed to obtain some crucial knowledge needs for management (e.g., water quality, nature conservation, food quality and security, fisheries management, and aquaculture acts and directives). Despite its focused objectives, this knowledge can indeed increase our global knowledge on these issues, especially if integrated in meta-analyses studies and literature reviews.</p>
