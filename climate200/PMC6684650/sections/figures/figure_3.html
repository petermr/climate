 <caption> Climatology ( a,c,e) and frequency distributions ( b,d,f) of daily simulated summer water temperatures for the 1960s and 2000s. Climatology and distributions represent the simulated averaged response of the sites in the upper (SFJ, NFF, NCF, SGN, NVH, NIP, FSY), middle (QQL, HHY, CAC, FTC, NTR, STC, TAT) and lower (FHG, FHE, HMR) FRB, respectively. Dashed lines represent individual responses at each site. The arrows in the left column indicate days of the summer with maximum water temperature. Vertical blue lines on frequency curves represent the 20 °C critical temperature. The frequency distributions do not differ significantly at p &lt; 0.05 according to a Kolmogorov‐Smirnov two‐sample test. 5-point running means smoothing was applied to all curves to facilitate comparison between time periods. See Supplementary Fig.  S6 for frequency distributions at each site. </caption>
