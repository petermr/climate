<p id="Par29">This study presents new insights on the evolution of daily water temperatures for 17 sites across the FRB using Air2Stream, a state-of-the-art, physically-based water temperature model. The simulations quantified changes in summer water temperature magnitudes, timing and extremes during the late 20
 <sup>th</sup> and early 21
 <sup>st</sup> centuries. Since the daily NSE scores ranged between 0.76–0.97 and daily RMSE and BIAS scores were reasonably low (~≤2 °C) for the calibration and validation periods, simulated water temperature diurnal and interannual variability aligned well with observations, thereby providing confidence in the Air2Stream model output. Indeed, all model performance metrics spanned the range of model reliability reported in the literature

 </sup> reported a regression model RMSE = 1.12 °C over 1953–1998 for the reconstruction of daily water temperatures at FHG. By comparison, our Air2Stream simulation RMSE = 0.98 °C at FHG thus performing equally well for the 2000–2010 calibration time period (Supplementary Table
