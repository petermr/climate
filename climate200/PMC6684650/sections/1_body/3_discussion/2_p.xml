<p id="Par30">Simulated water temperatures warmed substantially across the FRB between 1950–2015 in response mainly to rising air temperatures. Robust responses of water temperatures to changes in air temperatures (e.g. at SFJ, FSY, CAC and FTC) align with the results of Isaak

 </sup> for the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This effect is even amplified at SFJ owing to greater air temperature increases in northern sections of the FRB. The low gradient of elevation along the Stuart River slows the delivery of water towards the basin outlet and hence air and water temperatures remain tightly coupled. In contrast, the much steeper gradient along the Stellako and Nautley rivers decouples air and water temperatures thereby suppressing the impacts of rising air temperatures in the Air2Stream simulations at SGN and NFF. Such association of river water temperatures changes with basin characteristics is explored in many recent studies
