 </sup>, our model results reveal that ENSO and PDO strongly modulate water temperatures though atmospheric teleconnections by increasing (El-Niño and/or positive PDO phase) or decreasing (La-Niña and/or negative PDO phase) river water temperatures for most FRB sites with exception of SGN and NFF. The PDO’s relationship with SGN and NFF is most likely hindered by the presence of lakes modulating water temperatures more strongly than remote teleconnections. SGN and NFF are relatively small systems influenced by two large lakes: Francois and Fraser Lakes, respectively. SGN drains Francois Lake (254 km
 <sup>2</sup>) into Fraser Lake (55 km
 <sup>2</sup>) and NFF then drains Fraser Lake into the Nechako River. Simulation results suggest that the discharge at these two sites strongly influences water temperatures when compared to air temperature. Considering that the FRB’s river flows are strongly modulated by PDO phases

 </sup>, it is possible that flow changes at both SGN and NFF influence the water temperatures more directly than air temperature changes weakening the relationship of PDO phases. Overall our results on ENSO/PDO relationships with simulated water temperatures provide guidance on measures of predictability for seasonal anomalies of river water temperatures in the FRB. Improving understanding of these far-field relationships with changes in water temperature is crucial for the future conservation of different aquatic species, especially salmon populations.
