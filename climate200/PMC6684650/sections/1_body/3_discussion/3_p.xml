<p id="Par31">Sites such as QQL, HHY, CAC, STC, TAT, FHG and FHE experience warmer conditions during summer relative to other sites (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and their decreasing discharge levels are likely insufficient to modulate water temperature in this season. The physical mechanism(s) however, may well be different for these sites depending on regional characteristics such as the presence of large lakes, glaciers, and gradients of elevation along waterways. For example, while discharge contributes insufficiently to simulated water temperatures at HHY, modest increases in air temperature yield lower water temperature trends relative to the neighbouring QQL site. The two branches (NTR and STC) of the Thompson River, a tributary in the southeastern section of the FRB, also exhibits dampened warming trends for river water temperature relative to other waterways, likely due to the contribution of glacier-melt water from the Monashee, Cariboo and Rocky Mountains that regulates downstream river temperatures in this system.
