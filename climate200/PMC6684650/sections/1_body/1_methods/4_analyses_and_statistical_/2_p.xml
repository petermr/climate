<p id="Par14">We computed composites of strong El-Niño (1957–58, 1965–66, 1972–73, 1982–83, 1987–88, 1991–92, 1997–98, 2015–16) and strong La-Niña (1973–74, 1975–76, 1988–89, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2007–08, 2010–11, 2011–12) years to assess the corresponding anomalies in water temperatures. Strong El-Niño and La-Niña years, based on the 3-month running mean sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly for the Niño 3.4 region (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) in the tropical Pacific Ocean, were identified from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

 </sup>. The t-test statistic was used to compute the significance of the composite differences. Here it was assumed that the underlying process behaved as an independent and identically distributed random variable. We also computed differences between the strongest El-Niño (1997–98) and La-Niña (1973–74) events for each site to quantify corresponding anomalies in the water temperatures.
