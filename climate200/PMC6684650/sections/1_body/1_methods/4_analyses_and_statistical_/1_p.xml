<p id="Par13">Simulated mean summer water temperatures were first quantified for all river sites for 1950–2015. Monotonic trends in simulated water temperatures were then computed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall Test (MKT)

We summarised results using the temporal mean and interannual variability (standard deviation) of simulations at each site along with the multi-site mean and inter-site standard deviation (spread) of summer water temperature. The standard deviation at each site was used to compute signal to noise ratios (SNRs), i.e. 66-year summer water temperature trend divided by its interannual standard deviation.
