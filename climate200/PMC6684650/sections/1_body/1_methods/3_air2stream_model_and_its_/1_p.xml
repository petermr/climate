<p id="Par8">To simulate daily water temperatures, we employed the Air2Stream model

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>, a state-of-the-art hybrid river water temperature model relying on heat budgets with a similar formulation and approach as a lake surface temperature model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. The model utilizes an unknown river reach of volume V and atmospheric heat exchanges by implicitly considering both surface and subsurface water fluxes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. The formulation of the Air2Stream model begins from the physical relationships that are simplified to form a single ordinary differential equation linearly dependent on air temperature, water temperature and discharge. It is therefore considered a physically-based tool utilizing the observed data to update its numerical integration
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. The model is widely used with several recent studies comparing Air2Stream output with statistical models
