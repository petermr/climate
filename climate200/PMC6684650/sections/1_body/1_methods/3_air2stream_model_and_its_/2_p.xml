<p id="Par9">The Air2Stream model was integrated for its calibration and validation (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) using daily gridded air temperature, water temperature and discharge data at 17 river sites within the FRB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At each site we ran the Air2Stream model with 3-, 5- or 8-parameters to select its optimal version for which results are reported herein. Model performance was evaluated by comparing simulated daily water temperature time series with corresponding observations using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficients, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias (BIAS) statistical metrics. We also assessed model performance by comparing the observed and simulated water temperature interannual variability and, where data allow, long-term trends. This step allowed verification of Air2Stream’s performance in reproducing water temperature fluctuations associated with interannual climate oscillations such as ENSO and PDO and long-term trends owing to climate change. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> describes the full experimental setup of the Air2Stream model implementation and application.
