<p id="Par12">The Air2Stream model was driven using ANUSPLIN gridded air temperature forcing for all river sites. The ANUSPLIN gridded data are consistent and represent mean elevations at a ~10â€‰km (area ~ 100 km
 <sup>2</sup>) grid scale. Overall, the main advantage of using ANUSPLIN is data homogeneity and lack of gaps, which are commonly reported as major issues with station-based data. We therefore extracted mean air temperature data from gridded observations for all 17 sites rather than using available limited station-based data.
