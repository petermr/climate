<p id="Par36">This study formulates an important baseline for the historical changes in the simulated water temperatures across the FRB using the Air2Stream model forced with observational datasets. A key finding arising from this work is the modelâ€™s ability to reproduce observed interannual variability in summer water temperature for 17 rivers sites across the FRB. Whereas previous studies typically have implemented and evaluated statistical models at a limited number of river sites, this effort uses the physically-based Air2Stream model to simulate consistent and reliable estimates of daily water temperatures across the entire FRB. Our model results provide useful guidance for fisheries management for future governance and decision-making in the FRB. Climate change may continue to impose effects on salmon via increases in instream mortality and/or challenges to migration due to alterations in discharge. The ongoing warming of river thermal conditions in the FRB indicate that further efforts are needed to investigate projected changes in water temperatures under future climate change. Our future efforts will look at potential future water temperatures across the FRB using a combination of the Air2Stream model, future climate projections and projected discharge outputs available through a hydrological model used in our previous efforts
