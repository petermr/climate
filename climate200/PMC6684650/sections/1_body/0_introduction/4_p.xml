<p id="Par5">In this study, a state-of-the-art hybrid river water temperature model (Air2Stream

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>) is used to simulate daily river water temperature as a function of gridded air temperature (extracted from spatially interpolated observations of minimum and maximum daily air temperatures) and observed discharge at 17 river sites within the FRB from 1950 to 2015. The Air2Stream model was previously used in several river basins globally

 </sup>. In this study, using simulated water temperatures, we estimate summer trends, timing of peak water temperatures and occurrence of river temperatures above critical thresholds (i.e. the temperature range where salmon become stressed thereby affecting migration success
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>) to document changes in river thermal characteristics in relation to their possible impacts on sockeye salmon. To our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to simulate water temperatures simultaneously in various salmonid rivers across the FRB using this approach. This study thus addresses three main research aims: (1) to implement and evaluate a hybrid water temperature model at 17 river sites in the FRB, (2) to develop a comprehensive water temperature dataset to analyze long-term spatio-temporal changes in river water temperatures on various timescales, and (3) to quantify changes in extreme water temperature that may impact salmon migration.
