 <sup>th</sup> century and early 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, river flows throughout the FRB show increased variability due to changes in precipitation patterns and phase

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, the mean daily air temperature remains a key driver in modulating water temperatures, and conditions that are critical for successful salmonid survival in freshwater. Mean daily air temperatures and water temperatures are traditionally related as a joint system that exchanges net heat under an equilibrium temperature assumption

While there is considerable research interest in both observed climate change and impacts on salmon species in the FRB, further work is needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the large spatial and temporal climatic patterns that exert an influence on the FRB and how these relate to river water temperature.
