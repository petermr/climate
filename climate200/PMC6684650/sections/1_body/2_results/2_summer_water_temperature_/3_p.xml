<p id="Par24">The frequency distributions gradually shift toward higher summer water temperature in the recent past (i.e. 2000s) when compared to the 1960s for all three regions within the FRB with increased frequency of extreme warm events, especially those above 20 °C occurring during these times. Frequency distributions at each site show a similar pattern of a climate shift (Supplementary Fig.
