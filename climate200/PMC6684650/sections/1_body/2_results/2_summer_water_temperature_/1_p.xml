 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) except NFF, SGN and HHY. The summer trend of 1.56 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup> is significantly (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Most of the sites show significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher warming trends in August with the highest values at SFJ (1.68 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup>), FSY (1.69 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup>), CAC (1.75 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup>) and FTC (1.80 °C (66 yr)
 <sup>−1</sup>) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The interannual variability of summer water temperature ranges between 0.37 °C to 0.88 °C across the FRB where the regulated sites in the Nechako River (NCF, NVH and NIP) lie in the bottom 50% of interannual variability (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). The signal to noise ratio exceeds unity for the sites with significant warming trends during summer suggesting this secular pattern dominates the interannual variation.
