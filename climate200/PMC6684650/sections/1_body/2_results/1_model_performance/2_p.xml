<p id="Par20">For the Air2Stream model validation, similar metrics cannot be computed for all sites due to limited water temperature observations. For example, the HMR observed water temperature data were available only for 2009–2015 and used to calibrate the Air2Stream model for this site; there were no data beyond this period for model validation. For river sites with extended observed water temperature records (e.g. NVH, FHG), we computed Air2Stream performance metrics for validation periods using at least five years of data (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). NSE scores for the validation period for these sites range from 0.80 to 0.97, with an average NSE score of 0.92 revealing high model reliability. Similar to the calibration period, daily RMSE scores exceed mean summer RMSE on an interannual time scale for all sites. During validation, daily RMSE averages 1.42 °C (ranging from 1.09 °C to 2.16 °C), which is slightly higher than the calibration mean RMSE score of 1.26 °C. Overall, the RMSE and BIAS scores are reasonably low enough (~≤2.0 °C) for all sites providing confidence that the Air2Stream model performs adequately during the calibration and validation time periods. Errors lie within the acceptable range of water temperature model reliability reported in other studies

 </sup>. Observed and simulated water temperature climatologies during the calibration periods overlap each other for most of sites except FHE (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Furthermore, the Air2Stream model shows robust performance in simulating the observed interannual variability in summer water temperature for most river sites (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). For example, the SFJ simulated summer mean river water temperatures vary coherently with observed water temperatures with ~2.0 °C mean difference in some years. At NFF and NVH where observed daily water temperature records exceed 30 years (1981–2015), the model reproduces well simulated short-term summer water temperature trends (Supplementary Fig.
