<p id="Par27">The MLR analysis allows quantification of the contribution of mean air temperature and discharge to the simulated summer water temperature in the FRB. The variables used in the MLR analysis (Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) are, however, not completely independent of each other given the direct effect of air temperature on precipitation/snowmelt and associated discharge. Overall, the MLR performs reasonably well in estimating summer mean variability in water temperature, approaching Air2Stream simulations with explained variance (R
 <sup>2</sup>) exceeding 80% for all sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Analyses for individual summer months (July, August and September) show the MLR captures most of the explained variance in August for most sites (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>).
