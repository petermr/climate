<p id="Par26">Simulated water temperatures at all sites are associated with changes in ENSO phases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Strong El-Niño and La-Niña composites show considerable variation in simulated water temperature at all sites ranging between 0.5 °C to 1.0 °C (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>) with the difference between the strongest ENSO episodes (i.e. 1997–98 El-Niño minus 1973–74 La-Niña) reaching up to 2.0 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The response to ENSO is more prominent during August coinciding with the peak up-river salmon migration period

 </sup>. Similar to ENSO, both warm and cool PDO phases also modulate summer water temperatures. Apart from SGN and NFF, the PDO strongly affects simulated river water temperatures across all sites especially those in the upper FRB where differences between water temperatures in warm and cool PDO phases near 0.9 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>). Overall, most of the river sites within the FRB show significant correlation between far field teleconnections and simulated river water temperatures.
