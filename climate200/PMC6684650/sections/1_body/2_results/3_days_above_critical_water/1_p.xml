<p id="Par25">During the 66-year study period (1950–2015), the number of days exceeding 20 °C (T
 <sub>c20</sub>) is highest across the SFJ river when compared to all other sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The changes in extreme water temperature are quite variable along the Nechako River but more modest at other FRB sites. While the water temperatures never rise beyond 18 °C (T
 <sub>c18</sub>) in the QQL and NTR rivers, most of the remaining sites show substantial increases in T
 <sub>c18</sub> and T
 <sub>c20</sub> occurrences. For SFJ, days exceeding T
 <sub>c20</sub> increase markedly from 8 days in the 1960s to 71 days in the 2000s reflecting an amplifying frequency of extreme water temperatures with climate change. In contrast, at the highly regulated NVH, the largest count for days exceeding T
 <sub>c18</sub> is in the 1960s at 100 days of which 15 days surpassed T
 <sub>c20</sub>. In the 2000s, the number of days above T
 <sub>c18</sub> increases to 194 days with only 12 days exceeding T
 <sub>c20</sub> (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Across the study area, day counts for all critical temperatures have increased considerably in recent years (2000s) excluding highly regulated sites (NCF and NVH) in the upper FRB and QQL and NTR in the middle FRB. The difference of T
 <sub>c18</sub> and T
 <sub>c20</sub> between the 2000s and the 1960s for individual months shows the maximum contribution to the total number of days above T
 <sub>c20</sub> in summer occurs during July and August (Supplementary Table
