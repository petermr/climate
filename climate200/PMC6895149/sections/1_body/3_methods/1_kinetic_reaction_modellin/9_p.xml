<p id="Par44">The method developed here is a simple way of achieving our aims of directly estimating time-series of methane emissions flux over the observed range of individual sill dimensions. Additional effects such as latent heat of mineral organic maturation

 </sup> are included in other schemes for estimating thermogenic methane generation. Our method could be augmented to include these effects, though we anticipate that two other effects are more significant and will require more urgent attention. First, there is uncertainty in the proportion of generated methane released from the solid Earth (Discussion). Secondly, our NAIP sill province simulations show that 25% of sill aureoles interact with each other (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g, h</xref>), implying that a wider range initial conditions for thermal structure and organic reaction progress should be covered in future calculations.
