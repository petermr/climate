 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>κ</italic> is the thermal diffusivity. Before solidification, this equation was solved using the method given in §4.19 of ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, which accounts for latent heat of crystallisation. After solidification, Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">4</xref> was solved using an FTCS explicit finite difference scheme. A uniform distance grid was used, and the grid spacing was kept small enough to generate smooth emissions flux time-series: typically 1 m up to 250 years post intrusion, 5 m between 250 and 10,000 years after intrusion, and 20 m at greater times. Seabed temperature was held fixed. Constant heat flux was assumed at the boundary/ies far from the sill/dyke, and the distance grid was made long enough to minimise edge effects. Burial heating after intrusion was not considered because only times of &lt;1 Myr after intrusion are of interest here, during which burial heating is negligible in comparison with the thermal effect of the igneous sheet. At times well after complete solidification, an analytical solution is available to check these calculations (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, §4.21).
