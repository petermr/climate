<p id="Par35">The aims are to determine time-series of carbon emissions flux for comparison with PETM climate records (previous work reports final total mass of emissions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>), to cover the full observed range of sill thicknesses and emplacement depths (previous work covers thinner, shallower sills
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>), and to calculate methane generation directly (previous work uses vitrinite reflectance as a proxy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>). We combined several established methods to achieve these aims. All calculations were done in 1 spatial dimension: depth in the case of a sill, or horizontal distance in the case of a dyke. 1D calculations were used because the aim was to produce a simple parameterisation flexible enough to cover the observed range of sill and host-rock characteristics yet fast enough to be run very many times for stochastic modelling. The dyke calculations were used to test the numerical thermal calculations against analytical solutions for dykes, and to test the reaction calculations by comparison with published thermal aureole measurements for dykes.
