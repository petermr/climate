 <sub>repeat</sub> simulations represent maximum possible long-time emissions because they implicitly assume that each new sill intrudes host rock capable of generating methane. There are two reasons for assigning sill locations. First, the resulting maps provide a more intuitive description of our proposed link between mantle plume head and sill intrusion processes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>g–j; Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Secondly, sill locations can be used to ensure that when a sill intrudes host rock that has already been thermally matured by a previous sill, the emissions are not counted twice in the combined emissions histories.
