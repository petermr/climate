<p id="Par55">Our primary set of surface area observations comes from several 3D seismic reflection surveys close to the centre of the NAIP. These were checked with reference to 2D data from across the NAIP. Sill lengths measured on 2D surveys (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) were converted to areas assuming a circular planform. The sill area histogram for each 2D survey was corrected for the fact that the sill chord intersected by a randomly oriented seismic line rarely represents the true sill diameter. For both 3D and 2D data, we excluded surface areas &lt; 10 km
 <sup>2</sup> because hydrothermal vents are rarely observed associated with such small sills, so their methane likely migrates over a timeframe longer than that of interest here. Sill surface areas measured from satellite images of the Karoo sill province are shown for comparison in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> but were not included in the surface area distribution used for stochastic modelling.
