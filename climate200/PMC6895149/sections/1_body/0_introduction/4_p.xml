<p id="Par6">A crucial parameter to bridge this gap is 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub>, the typical time period between intrusion of successive sills. 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> must be significantly less than the typical cooling time period for one sill (i.e. &lt;100 years) for many sill–vent systems to be active simultaneously. The simplest way to estimate 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> is to divide the sill province duration by the total number of sills. There are 11,000–18,000 sill–vent systems within the NAIP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> but the sill province duration is uncertain. The generally quoted duration for the starting phases of the NAIP and other LIPs is 1–3 Myr
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, giving 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> of 56–273 yr. However, 95% of sills intruded simultaneously (at seismic imaging resolution) in individual basins near the NAIP centre, perhaps suggesting 60 kyr for the local province duration
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, which corresponds to 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> of 3 yr. Measuring 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub> for the NAIP sill province directly using traditional radiometric or biostratigraphic dating methods would be a huge undertaking. A fundamental difficulty is that these methods have 10
 <sup>5</sup>–10
 <sup>6</sup>-year resolution, whereas the PETM onset was 10
 <sup>4</sup> years or less. In principle, this difficulty might be overcome by statistical modelling of large numbers (&gt;100) of radiometric ages of sills across entire NAIP footprint, as has been shown for the Karoo LIP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Unfortunately, much of the NAIP lies within the deep-water oil exploration frontier; it could be many decades before sufficient sill samples from boreholes become available.
