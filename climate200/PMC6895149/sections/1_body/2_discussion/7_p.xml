<p id="Par34">We have presented the first mechanistic model of carbon emissions flux from any proposed PETM carbon source that is directly constrained by measurements of the geological structures that control the emissions. Differences between our carbon emissions source function and carbon emissions inferred independently from climatic effects provide for the first time the potential to directly measure climate system feedbacks. However, it is too early to interpret source-sink differences in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> in terms of such feedbacks. For example, modelling the carbon sink
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup> indicates peak emissions flux of 0.5–0.6 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> followed by a sharp decrease. Our median estimate of the carbon emissions source has a peak 0.2–0.3 PgC yr
 <sup>–1</sup> lower and a smoother post-peak decrease. However, the smoothness of our carbon flux estimate derives partly from the smooth curve used to represent the sill distribution (

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Given sparse 
 <italic>ρ</italic> measurements near the sill province centre, we cannot yet rule out a carbon emissions source function that would match emissions inferred from inverse modelling of the carbon sink more closely (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Considering uncertainties in the other controls on 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>repeat</sub>, peak emissions flux could occur between 1 and 20 kyr (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Thus, more sill distribution measurements, more mantle plume flux measurements and improved measurements of the shape and positioning of the plume head are required to reduce the uncertainty range of our solid Earth emissions model. These combined uncertainties at present leave room for a scenario in which no significant greenhouse gas sources external to the NAIP sill province are required to explain the PETM onset and the first few tens of thousands of years of the PETM recovery. Clarification of this carbon cycle behaviour will impact modelling and management of future climate change. We therefore eagerly anticipate improvements in modelling both the source and fate of carbon for the NAIP-PETM pair, and also other LIPs paired with major climate change events.
