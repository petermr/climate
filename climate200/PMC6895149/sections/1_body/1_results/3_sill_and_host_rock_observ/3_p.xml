<p id="Par15">Maximum sill thickness was measured for the subset of sills that show seismic reflections from both top and base. We observe a positive linear correlation (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.31) between maximum diameter and maximum thickness. The maximum sill thickness used in stochastic modelling was obtained by first applying the linear regression to the stochastically chosen diameter (assuming a circular sill) and perturbing this value by a thickness selected from a uniform distribution between ±100 m. We measured sill thickness as a function of radius both directly, where top and bottom reflections were visible, and indirectly from forced folds in the contemporary seabed. We find that radial sill profiles of
