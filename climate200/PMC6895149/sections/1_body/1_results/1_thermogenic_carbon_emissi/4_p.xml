<p id="Par11">The second use of the new calculations was to generate look-up tables to estimate the parameter set (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>therm</sub>, 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>decay</sub>, 
 <italic>p</italic>) required to calculate carbon emissions over time from a set of sill dimensions and host-rock characteristics (
 <italic>A, K</italic>, 
 <italic>S, Z, w</italic>
 <sub>CH4</sub>, 
 <italic>β</italic>). The sill dimensions are: 
 <italic>A</italic>, surface area; 
 <italic>S</italic>, maximum thickness; 
 <italic>β</italic>, a dimensionless parameter to describe how thickness varies; and 
 <italic>Z</italic>, intrusion depth. The host-rock characteristics are: 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>CH4</sub>, the concentration of organic matter that converts to methane; and 
 <italic>K</italic>, the type of organic matter. Results are stated in terms of the total contact aureole thickness scaled by the sill thickness, 
 <italic>Y</italic>, which is directly proportional to 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>therm</sub>, and the emissions decay time scaled by the thermal conductive cooling time, 
 <italic>τ*</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These results cover the full range of NAIP sill observations for the first time. Sills thinner than 150 m emplaced less than 1.5 km deep have scaled aureoles of 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 200–400%, in agreement with previous work
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, and emissions decay times similar to their thermal cooling times. As sill thickness and emplacement depth increase to 250 m and 3 km, respectively, 
 <italic>Y</italic> and 
 <italic>τ*</italic> increase to 800% and 400%, respectively, because longer solidification times and higher background temperature mean that greater temperatures are maintained for longer near the sill. 
 <italic>Y</italic> and 
 <italic>τ*</italic> then decrease with further increases in 
 <italic>S</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic> because deeper host rocks have already generated and expelled methane by burial maturation prior to sill intrusion. The 
 <italic>p</italic> exponent values account for the dependence of thermogenic reaction rates on temperature as well as time, so they exceed the 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5 indicated by analytical solutions of conductive sill cooling
