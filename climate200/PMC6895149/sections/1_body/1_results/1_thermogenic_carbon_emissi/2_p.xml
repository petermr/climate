<p id="Par9">We only considered thermogenic reactions that produce methane from organic matter. Almost all of the carbon produced from the NAIP sill province host rocks (mainly mudrock) is generated via these reactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. We calculated time-series of methane gas generation directly, rather than tracking vitrinite reflectance as a proxy for gas generation as in previous studies of the PETM-NAIP sills link
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. We used a standard oil-industry kinetic model for gas generation that has been calibrated against both laboratory and geological datasets, which bracket the heating rates generated by shallow igneous sills

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Methane generation involves three reaction pathways: refractory (gas-prone) kerogen matures to produce methane; labile (oil-prone) kerogen matures to produce mostly oil and some methane; and oil cracks to produce methane. Vitrinite reflectance reactions can be tracked using the same scheme

 </sup>, and all our model results match a compilation of vitrinite reaction aureole data
