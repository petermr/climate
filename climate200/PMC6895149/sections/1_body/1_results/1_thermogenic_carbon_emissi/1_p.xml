 </sup>, no studies provide time-series of methane emissions flux that we can use for stochastic modelling and few studies model methane generation directly. We require a rapid method to calculate carbon flux from individual sills with a wide range of dimensions because the calculation must be repeated over 10,000 times to simulate combined emissions from the entire NAIP, and hundreds of simulations of the entire province are needed to determine uncertainty bounds. We therefore developed a new parameterisation of thermogenic reaction kinetic modelling results. We first carried out a series of coupled thermal and reaction kinetic calculations that spanned the observed ranges in sill dimensions and emplacement depth (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These calculations were done in one spatial dimension (distance perpendicular to the sill) to give the necessary flexibility to scale the results to the observed ranges of sill and host-rock dimensions during stochastic modelling.
