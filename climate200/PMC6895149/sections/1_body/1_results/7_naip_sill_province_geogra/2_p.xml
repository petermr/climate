<p id="Par25">The heavily intruded part of the NAIP sill province comprises the Vøring, Møre, Faroe-Shetland and Rockall chain of sedimentary basins. We measured the area of this basin chain and hence calculated the function Γ(
 <italic>R</italic>), which captures the relationship between plume head and sill province areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Γ initially increases as the leading edge of the plume head arrives beneath the sill province and then decreases roughly linearly with radius.
