  <p>New framework for determining greenhouse gas emissions from the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Initiation of the Icelandic mantle convection cell occurred during early to middle Paleocene time, accompanied by volumetrically minor igneous activity. By late Paleocene time, a mantle plume head comprising anomalously hot mantle lay beneath the lithosphere of NW Europe and Greenland, fed by a conduit beneath eastern Greenland. Flow within all upper mantle convection cells is unsteady, or pulsing. Pulses are patches of mantle with particularly high temperature anomalies that travel up the plume conduit and spread outwards within the plume head as rings. The hottest of these pulses travelled up the plume conduit in latest Paleocene time and spread through the plume head in earliest Eocene time. When this thermal pulse travelled beneath thin lithosphere, the reduction in depth led to pressure-release partial melting. The rate of magma generation depended on the mantle plume flux. Most thin-spot melting occurred beneath the chain of deep-water sedimentary basins comprising the Rockall, Faroe-Shetland, Møre and Vøring Basins (labelled R, F, M and V, respectively), which had formed by rifting during mid Cretaceous time. Basaltic magma generated at the base of the lithosphere separated rapidly from the mantle source and travelled rapidly upwards. Much of this magma stalled within the crust as roughly horizontal, sheet-like intrusions called sills, known collectively as the NAIP sill province. The sills heated the surrounding sedimentary rock and converted trace amounts of organic carbon to thermogenic methane. Heat from the sills also boiled the pore fluid within the host rock, which fractured the rock and created hydrothermal vents. Pore-water convection carried the methane to the ocean and atmosphere. Additional carbon emissions comprising predominantly magmatic carbon dioxide are associated with break-up between Europe and Greenland to form the NAIP magma-rich passive margins (labelled b-b-b-b). These emissions likely have lower flux in comparison with peak thermogenic methane emissions from the NAIP sill province. Thus, mantle plume flux is the primary control on both magma generation rate and also thermogenic methane emissions rate associated with the NAIP sill province.</p>
