 <caption> Sill province carbon emissions at constant time period between successive sill intrusions. a Cumulative histogram of peak carbon emissions (averaged over the first year after injection) for individual NAIP sills, calculated from new NAIP sill dimension database (Fig.  4) using new emissions parameterisation (Methods). b Cumulative histogram of emissions decay time for individual NAIP sills calculated in the same way: dashed line for maximum sill thicknesses; solid line for mean sill thicknesses. c Stack of 30 simulated carbon emissions histories for constant sill intrusion intervals of τ repeat = 2 years (red) and 4 years (maroon). d Expanded view of first 100 years of one simulation with τ repeat = 2 years, showing combined emissions from the sill province as a red line and contributions from individual sills as grey lines. e Relationship between long-time (post-10 kyr) mean emissions flux and sill recurrence period from multiple experiments like c. Horizontal blue line and envelope show most likely value 5, 6 and range 4, 5 of peak emissions required to explain PETM onset determined from climate models. Yellow dots show power law approximation in Eq.  1. f Comparison between peak carbon fluxes from our sill province models (lines) and peak fluxes estimated from PETM climate models (spots) as functions of PETM onset duration. Sill province models: thinner black line shows when the long-time mean is first reached; thicker black line shows when the 1 kyr running mean first reaches long-time mean; shaded regions show ± 1 s.d. for the 100-run ensembles. Climate models: circles are from joint inverse modelling of pH and carbon isotope composition 7 ; triangles are from forward modelling of carbon isotope composition and deep-sea carbonate dissolution (triange 6 ; inverted triangle 57 ). </caption>
