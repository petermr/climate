  <p>NAIP carbon emissions based on mantle convection model, and comparison with climate-based emissions reconstructions. 
   <bold>a</bold> The red cloud is a stack of 100 simulated NAIP emissions flux histories with variable 
   <italic>τ</italic>
   <sub>repeat</sub> controlled by plume head model and NAIP geography and the median mantle plume flux estimate. Red lines show ensemble means using the upper and lower quartile mantle plume flux estimates; dotted red lines show ensemble means using the 10th and 90th percentile plume flux estimates. The blue line and envelope show the emissions estimate and uncertainty range from joint inverse modelling of oceanic pH and carbon isotope records

   <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>) showing sills intruding the the Rockall–Faroe-Shetland–Møre-Vøring sedimentary basin chain at progressively increasing distances from province centre. Red circles show sill–vent systems currently emitting carbon: the shade of red is proportional to the emissions flux and the size is proportional to final cumulative emissions (horizontal scale exaggerated). Older sill–vent systems no longer emitting carbon are coloured grey. Pale blue ellipses show positions of the thermal anomaly in the sub-plate convecting mantle, which generates the sill-province magma: the heavy line marks the peak thermal anomaly; the thin line indicates 5% of the peak thermal anomaly.
