  <p>Sill province carbon emissions at constant time period between successive sill intrusions. 
   <bold>a</bold> Cumulative histogram of peak carbon emissions (averaged over the first year after injection) for individual NAIP sills, calculated from new NAIP sill dimension database (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) using new emissions parameterisation (Methods). 
   <bold>b</bold> Cumulative histogram of emissions decay time for individual NAIP sills calculated in the same way: dashed line for maximum sill thicknesses; solid line for mean sill thicknesses. 
   <bold>c</bold> Stack of 30 simulated carbon emissions histories for constant sill intrusion intervals of

   <sub>repeat</sub> = 2 years (red) and 4 years (maroon). 
   <bold>d</bold> Expanded view of first 100 years of one simulation with 
   <italic>τ</italic>
   <sub>repeat</sub> = 2 years, showing combined emissions from the sill province as a red line and contributions from individual sills as grey lines. 
   <bold>e</bold> Relationship between long-time (post-10 kyr) mean emissions flux and sill recurrence period from multiple experiments like

   <bold>f</bold> Comparison between peak carbon fluxes from our sill province models (lines) and peak fluxes estimated from PETM climate models (spots) as functions of PETM onset duration. Sill province models: thinner black line shows when the long-time mean is first reached; thicker black line shows when the 1 kyr running mean first reaches long-time mean; shaded regions show ± 1 s.d. for the 100-run ensembles. Climate models: circles are from joint inverse modelling of pH and carbon isotope composition
