 <caption> NAIP carbon emissions based on mantle convection model, and comparison with climate-based emissions reconstructions. a The red cloud is a stack of 100 simulated NAIP emissions flux histories with variable τ repeat controlled by plume head model and NAIP geography and the median mantle plume flux estimate. Red lines show ensemble means using the upper and lower quartile mantle plume flux estimates; dotted red lines show ensemble means using the 10th and 90th percentile plume flux estimates. The blue line and envelope show the emissions estimate and uncertainty range from joint inverse modelling of oceanic pH and carbon isotope records 5 . The green line shows emissions estimated from forward modelling of carbon isotope and deep-sea carbonate dissolution records 6, 13 . b Emissions flux for one stochastic run. c Cumulative emissions associated with a. d Isotopic composition of emissions. Blue circles are sensitivity experiments that show impact of uncertainty in PETM onset duration on mean isotopic composition of emissions 5 ; filled circle most closely comparable with our simulations (10 kyr onset). Blue line/envelope truncated at 30 kyr, when significant carbon burial begins to influence predicted composition of emissions 5 . e Proportion of total emissions released as thermogenic methane. f Exploration of mechanisms for post-peak reduction in emissions itemised in Fig.  7: red stack, same as a; purple stack, ignoring effect of overlapping sill aureoles; maroon stack, ignoring effects of overlapping aureoles and radial decrease in sill intrusion density; brown stack, constant τ repeat = 4 yr, i.e. ignoring effects of overlapping aureoles, radial decrease in sill intrusion density and radial spreading of magma generation zone. g– j Snapshots from one NAIP simulation (Supplementary Movie  1) showing sills intruding the the Rockall–Faroe-Shetland–Møre-Vøring sedimentary basin chain at progressively increasing distances from province centre. Red circles show sill–vent systems currently emitting carbon: the shade of red is proportional to the emissions flux and the size is proportional to final cumulative emissions (horizontal scale exaggerated). Older sill–vent systems no longer emitting carbon are coloured grey. Pale blue ellipses show positions of the thermal anomaly in the sub-plate convecting mantle, which generates the sill-province magma: the heavy line marks the peak thermal anomaly; the thin line indicates 5% of the peak thermal anomaly. </caption>
