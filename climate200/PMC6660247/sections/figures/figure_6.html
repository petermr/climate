 <caption> Experiment 3. (A) In the rising red condition, the rising phase from 1950 to 2017 was highlighted in red. (B) In the flat red condition, the flat phase from 1880 to 1949 was highlighted in red. (C) In the control condition, both rising and flat phases were in gray. A heatmap representing the distribution of the average density of mouse location on the graph is shown on the right side in each condition. Warmer colors represent higher average density of mouse location. </caption>
