<p>An important limitation of the current study is that it does not provide evidence on how altered perceptions and actions reinforce prior motivations. This is a promising avenue for future studies that can examine this positive feedback loop between actions and motivations. For interventions, future studies can also investigate ways to break the feedback loop to prevent further polarization. For example, since conservatives were more likely to act when they voluntarily attended to stronger evidence of climate change, but not when their attention was deliberately drawn to the evidence, one solution is to implicitly bias conservatives’ visual attention to stronger climate change evidence, such as framing the evidence in a way that is consistent with their values and beliefs (
