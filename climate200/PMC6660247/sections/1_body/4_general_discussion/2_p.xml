<p>In three experiments, we provided initial preliminary evidence to support the motivated attention framework. In Experiment 1, we found that liberals tended to attend more to the rising phase of the temperature curve than the flat phase of the curve and give a higher estimate of global temperature change than conservatives did. In addition, liberals who attended more to the rising phase of the curve relative to the flat phase gave a higher estimate of temperature change, but this effect was weaker in conservatives. However, this result was not found in the neutral condition. Thus, attending more to the rising phase of the temperature curve may induce concerns in liberals, leading to a bias in their estimation of the global temperature change, but attending more to the rising phase of the neutral curve does not alter the perception of the evidence because of a lack of prior motivations. These results suggest that political orientation can bias visual attention to climate change evidence, which alters the perception of the evidence.</p>
