<p>Beyond group polarization, the current study provides an attentional account to several well-established phenomena in social psychology. For example, cognitive dissonance is triggered when the evidence presented is inconsistent with a person’s beliefs, which can motivate the person to try to reduce dissonance (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Festinger, 1962</xref>). One way to reduce dissonance is to avoid focusing attention on situations or information which will likely increase dissonance, and pay greater attention to information which will help to achieve consonance. Another example is confirmation bias where a person seeks or interprets evidence in ways that confirm existing beliefs, expectations, or a hypothesis in mind (
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Nickerson, 1998</xref>). The person may increase his/her attention to evidence that confirms their prior beliefs and suppress attention to evidence that disconfirms their beliefs. A third example is the central and peripheral route to persuasion, where the former involves a deliberate analysis of the content of the message, and the latter uses simple cues in the context (
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Petty and Cacioppo, 1986</xref>). The central route is employed when a person is motivated and has the ability to process the arguments in the message. Otherwise, the peripheral route takes place. When the evidence is consistent with people’s motivations, they may pay more attention to the evidence to deliberately analyze the information, which follows the central route. When the evidence is inconsistent with their motivations, they may pay less attention to the evidence and instead to the peripheral cues, which follows the peripheral route. As shown in one of the past studies, when a message is framed consistently with one’s value, it is more likely to be processed deliberately, and the strength of the argument influenced one’s attitude (
