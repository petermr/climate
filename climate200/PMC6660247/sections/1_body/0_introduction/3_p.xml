<p>To explain public skepticism on climate change, traditional accounts have adopted an information deficit model that attributes disbelief to a lack of knowledge or understanding (
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzoni et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2016</xref>), a lack of affect (
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Leiserowitz, 2006</xref>), or insufficient awareness about the issue (
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Norton and Leaman, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006</xref>). However, these accounts have failed to explain the partisan polarization over the years when an increasing volume of information and evidence on climate change has been presented to the public. Another conundrum is that individuals with high science literacy and technical reasoning skills are not the most concerned about climate change, but rather, they are the ones among whom polarization is the greatest (
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Kahan, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Fischhoff, 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Kahan et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the public divide on climate change is not solely driven by a lack of understanding or knowledge, and the mere presentation of climate change evidence is likely insufficient to convince the public.
