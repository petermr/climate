<p>Climate change involves a significant change in weather patterns around the world due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere mostly driven by human activities over the last 50 years (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014</xref>). The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has recently exceeded a mole fraction of 400 parts per million, higher than any century in the past 420,000 years (

 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2018a</xref>,

 <sub>2</sub>, global mean surface temperature increased by 0.87°C in the last decade compared to the average temperature from 1850 to 1900, and it is projected to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 (

 <sub>2</sub> concentration and global temperature pose a significant threat to humanity because of their severe, extensive, adverse impacts on human and natural systems. Studies have shown that climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (
