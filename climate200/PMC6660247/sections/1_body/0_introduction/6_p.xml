<p>Although many studies have suggested social motivations and ideologies determine the interpretation of quantitative evidence, it is currently unknown 
 <italic>how</italic> motivations and ideologies shape perception and judgment. To specifically examine how this process occurs, here we propose a motivated attention framework to offer an attentional mechanism to explain the political polarization on climate change. Specifically, socio-political motivations shape visual attention to climate change evidence, altering the perception of the evidence and subsequent actions to mitigate climate change. The altered perception and actions can further reinforce prior beliefs and motivations, thus creating a positive feedback loop (

This framework is supported by our previous work that demonstrates that liberals who are concerned about climate change attend more readily to climate-related words over neutral words, but conservatives who are not concerned about climate change do not show an attentional priority of climate-related words over neutral words, suggesting that political orientations are associated with different attentional priorities of climate change (
