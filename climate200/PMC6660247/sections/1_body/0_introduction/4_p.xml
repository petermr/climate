<p>Recent efforts to explain group polarization have relied on a motivated reasoning approach that traces back to studies on motivated social cognition in the early 1950’s. In a pioneering study, 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hastorf and Cantril (1954)</xref> demonstrated that after watching the same football game between Princeton and Dartmouth teams, Princeton and Dartmouth students drew distinct conclusions about the game, where they largely disagreed on the number of infractions made by each team, the reasons behind these infractions, the roughness of the game, and who started the rough play. This study suggests that the same sensory input is interpreted in vastly different ways depending on the viewer’s social affiliations, predispositions, and motivations.
