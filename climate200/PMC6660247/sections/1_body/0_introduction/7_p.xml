<p>In the motivated attention framework, we define political motivation as political orientation, and we predict that liberals and conservatives attend to the same climate change evidence (i.e., a graph of global temperature) in ways that are consistent with their political norms. Attention is measured by eye gaze dwell time on the graph. We define perception of climate evidence as the estimation of global temperature from the graph, and actions to mitigate climate change as the likelihood to sign climate petitions or donate to an environmental organization. To seek evidence for this framework, we conducted three experiments to examine how people with different political orientations perceive the same global temperature graph and whether the perceptual differences can be explained by different attentional priorities (Experiment 1), how these attentional biases alter actions to mitigate climate change (Experiment 2), and how drawing attention to motivationally consistent evidence influences climate actions (Experiment 3).</p>
