<p>This experiment examines how political motivation alters the perception of climate change evidence. We predict that people with different political orientations perceive the same temperature graph differently when the graph is framed as global temperature, but not when the graph is under a neutral frame (i.e., when the evidence is not motivationally relevant). We further examine whether the perceptual differences can be explained by different attentional allocations on the graph. We tracked visual attention using an eyetracker in the lab while participants were viewing the graph. We predict that liberals and conservatives focus on different parts of the graph consistent with their political motivations to guide their temperature estimation.</p>
