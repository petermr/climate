<p>We then examined the relationship between visual attention and estimation. In the temperature condition, proportional dwell time on the rising phase relative to the flat phase was positively correlated with estimates of temperature change [
 <italic>r</italic>(102) = 0.33, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001], but not in neutral condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(101) = 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.60]. This suggests that more attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the curve (i.e., more attention to stronger evidence of climate change) was associated with higher estimations of temperature change. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, we found that liberals who focused more on the rising phase of the curve relative to the flat phase provided higher estimates of temperature change [
 <italic>r</italic>(67) = 0.30, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01], and for conservatives, there was a marginal correlation [
 <italic>r</italic>(19) = 0.38, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09]. We note that although the value of 
 <italic>p</italic> was marginal, the correlation coefficient was larger for conservatives than for liberals. This may be due to the smaller sample size of conservatives. The correlation coefficient may change if the sample size of conservatives increased. In the neutral condition, no correlation was found for liberals [
 <italic>r</italic>(67) = 0.09, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.46] or conservatives [
 <italic>r</italic>(19) = âˆ’0.01, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.95]. In sum, these results provide initial evidence suggesting that political orientation could be associated with attentional biases which alter the perception of the same evidence.
