<p>The objective average change in the graph was 0.01, and participants in both conditions over-estimated the average value change (mean estimated change = 0.52 in the temperature condition, mean estimated change = 0.43 in the neutral condition, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Participants in the temperature condition estimated the change as numerically larger than those in the neutral condition [

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.14, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.20].
