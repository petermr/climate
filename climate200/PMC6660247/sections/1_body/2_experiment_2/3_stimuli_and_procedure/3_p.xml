<p>After viewing the graph, participants were asked to estimate the average global temperature (°C) in the temperature condition, or the average value in the neutral condition from 1880 to 2017. They were asked to provide an estimate between 13 and 16 (the bounds of the y-axis). After providing the estimates, participants were presented with a petition to stand with the Nature Conservancy to call on United States leaders to stand strong on climate change, and were asked whether they were willing to sign it. Participants also indicated whether they were willing to donate to Natural Resource Defense Council. The order of the petition and the donation question was random. If participants were willing to sign the pledge, they provided their name and email which were then forwarded to 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://change.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">change.org</ext-link>. If participants were willing to donate, they were asked to indicate the amount of donation (which was only hypothetical). At the end of the experiment, participants in both conditions provided their demographic information and rated their political orientation on the same 11-point scale. As in the previous experiment, we divided participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −0.82 (47 liberals and 29 conservatives). In the neutral condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was 0.11 (32 liberals and 39 conservatives).
