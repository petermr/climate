<p>We then examined the relationship between attention and temperature estimation. In the temperature condition, we found that greater proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase was positively correlated with higher estimate of temperature [
 <italic>r</italic>(85) = 0.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001], but no correlation was found in the neutral condition [
 <italic>r</italic>(88) = âˆ’0.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.37]. This result replicated the findings in Experiment 2, suggesting that more attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the temperature curve (i.e., more salient evidence of climate change) was associated with higher estimations of global temperature.
