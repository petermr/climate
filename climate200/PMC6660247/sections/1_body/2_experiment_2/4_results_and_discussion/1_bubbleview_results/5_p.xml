<p>The heatmaps of the average density of mouse location on the graph for liberals and conservatives are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The heatmap of the average dwell time for independents (whose ratings on the political orientation scale were 0) in the temperature condition is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Section B of Supplementary Materials</xref>. In the temperature condition, liberals who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase provided marginally higher estimates of temperature [
 <italic>r</italic>(45) = 0.28, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.054], and the same marginal correlation was found for conservatives [
 <italic>r</italic>(27) = 0.35, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06]. In the neutral condition, no correlation was found for liberals [
 <italic>r</italic>(30) = 0.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.59] or conservatives [
 <italic>r</italic>(37) = âˆ’0.25, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.13]. These results suggest that both liberals and conservatives who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase tended to provide a higher estimation of global temperature, which partially replicated Experiment 1 in which we found that liberals who focused more on the rising phase showed significantly higher perceived temperature, but this correlation was only marginal for conservatives.
