<p>The vulnerability assessment of our study takes as its starting point the IPCC typology, which describes climate change-led vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The reasons for adopting the E-S-A framework are threefold: first, it accumulates the main elements of socioeconomic and ecological systems at multiple scales; secondly, it accentuates adaptive capacity, which determines the level of vulnerability to a greater extent; and finally, it affords an integrated assessment by capturing a diverse set of layers and suitable indicators.
