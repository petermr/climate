<p>The proposed ALVI model can also be used as a generalized operational method in other geographical areas, to accumulate multi-dimensional spatial information that can be used to identify vulnerability and assist policy-makers in supporting climate-change adaptation. However, the selection of variables requires a careful and methodical assessment, as climate change-induced vulnerability is a complex phenomenon and is strongly correlated with local socioeconomic, ecological and biophysical conditions. Furthermore, a decent data management strategy at an appropriate spatial scale is needed for an accurate reflection of agricultural sector vulnerability through ALVI. </p>
