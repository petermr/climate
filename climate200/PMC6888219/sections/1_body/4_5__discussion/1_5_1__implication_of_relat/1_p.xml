<p>At a glance, the vulnerability map suggests that all the top-ranked vulnerable districts are distributed at the mouth of the famous deltaic Meghna estuaries and the Ganges-Brahmaputra coastal plain adjacent to the south-central coastline. This finding partially supports the previous vulnerability assessments [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], while disagreeing with regard to agricultural vulnerability assessment of Uddin et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Uddin et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] considered that only two variables—rice production and irrigation pump use—reflected agricultural vulnerability, and applied the PCA (principal component analysis) method. The ALVI approach, however, includes more indicators to represent the diversified agriculture of coastal Bangladesh, and applies unequal weighting of indicators by the experts’ judgment, providing more accurate results [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The most vulnerable region was also found to be the most exposed to climatic variability and disasters, compared to other districts, a result in agreement with the hazard map of Bangladesh developed by CEGIS [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and some other literature [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
