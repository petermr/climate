<p>A closer inspection of the vulnerability map; however, reveals that the top two most vulnerable districts (Bhola and Patuakhali) possessed higher exposures and sensitivities and lower adaptive capacity, and are in a hot-spot zone. The higher level of adaptive capacity and low sensitivity of the Khulna district, on the other hand, ameliorated its high exposure to climate disaster. In contrast, the Chittagong district, despite its high level of adaptive capacity and low sensitivity, was influenced by a very high level of exposure and pushed the district to higher vulnerability. On the other hand, exceptionally low adaptive capacity, coupled with high exposure and moderate sensitivity, pushed Noakhali towards being a very highly vulnerable district. In general, districts in the interior coast had less exposure, sensitivity, and overall vulnerability to climate change. </p>
