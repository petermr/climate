<p>A crucial finding was a very high level of vulnerability in the Patuakhali district. The district is categorized as highly prone to climate disasters, especially cyclones, sea level rise [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and low tendency to adopt innovative agricultural technologies [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This study supports previous findings regarding farm technology use capacity and high exposure to cyclones. However, the Patuakhali district is less exposed to precipitation variability, flood hazards, and extreme temperature events, and, combined with a relatively lower level of literacy, industrial workers, structurally sound houses, road density, electricity, agricultural diversity index, crop productivity, and cropping intensity, and a higher level of rain-fed cropland, dependence on agricultural production, and unhygienic sanitation conditions triggered the districtâ€™s high vulnerability.
