<p>Understanding and prioritizing which areas and communities, at sub-national scales, are most vulnerable to climate change has become a growing concern in policy circles in order to develop a sustainable adaptation plan. We developed an ALVI method for assessing the relative vulnerability of coastal agricultural livelihoods to climate change impacts with regards to the spatial variations of climatic change, disaster events, demography, health, land resources, agricultural practices, livelihood capitals, and agro-technology use. The proposed framework could help in identifying the most vulnerable geographic units and their hot spots for prioritized attention. It can also help distinguish the causal factors to existing vulnerability, referred to in this study as ‘drivers’ and ‘buffers’, with the former being identified as aspects for prioritized investment to support adaptation intervention. </p>
