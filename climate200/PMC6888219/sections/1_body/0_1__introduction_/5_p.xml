<p>Bangladesh is an agro-economy-based developing country [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] where agricultural livelihoods, particularly in the coastal region, are becoming more vulnerable to increased intensity of climatic variability and extreme weather events (floods, droughts, storm surges and cyclones), along with environmental degradation (salinization, inundation and soil erosion) over different time horizons [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The coastal communities, in particular, have a high exposure to these stressors [
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, the last two mega-cyclone events—Sidr and Aila—occurred in 2007 and 2009, causing a large number of human casualties; losses to the economy, agriculture and infrastructure; and imbalances in ecological processes; and ruining the livelihoods of millions of people, eventually instigating mass migration from the southwestern coastal region to other areas of the country [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, about 63% of the cultivable area in the coastal zone is affected by various degrees of soil salinity and predicted that a one-meter rise of sea level will place almost 20% of the land area of Bangladesh under the sea and cause 20–30 million people to be displaced from the coastal zone [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The production of oilseed, jute, and sugarcane has already been discontinued as a result of salinization, triggering land-use change towards saline aquacultures like shrimp or rice-shrimp systems that adversely affect the environment [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, adapting to an unprecedented rate of climate change is becoming the biggest challenge, prompting an urgent need for broader adaptation options [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] for safeguarding the jeopardized agricultural livelihoods of coastal people and anticipation of even greater climatic variation in the future [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Assessing agricultural livelihood vulnerability to climate change is therefore imperative to formulate and implement targeted adaptation strategies and setting priority areas for investment in the agricultural sector [
