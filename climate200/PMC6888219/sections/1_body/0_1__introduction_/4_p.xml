<p>Since agriculture is one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change, efforts are being attempted to outline and compare different levels of agricultural vulnerability by generating composite indices based on sets of indicators by reflecting multiple dimensions of the vulnerability concept, capturing the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of agroecological systems [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In fact, numerous studies [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in the literature have been conducted at multiple scales and have covered different sectors of agriculture, including crops, fisheries, forestry, and livestock. The primary focus of these studies was to “help policymakers identify ‘hotspots’ in allocating adaptation resources, communicate climate risks to the public, monitor the effects of adaptation measures, and understand the weakness in the socio-ecological system that leads to vulnerability” [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, most of these studies showed ‘snapshot’ views of agricultural systems’ vulnerability by incorporating some commonly used indicators [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and little research has focused on agricultural practices in small densely populated countries whose economies are predominantly based on subsistence farming; such countries differ widely from countries with large but low-density populations, where commercial farming prevails and farms are less diversified.
