 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Table S4</xref>) that the Khulna district alone fell under the category of very high adaptive capacity, with an index value 0.562, corresponding to its higher proportion of employed population (35%), female workforce (6.30%), income diversification (IDI = 5347.11), medical density (15.39/100,000 people), structurally sound houses (41.30%), dams (25.06%), natural forests (46.21%) and lower fertilizer application (0.11 ton/ha). The districts Jessore, Satkhira, and Chittagong had index scores between 0.460–0.510 and were categorized under the high adaptive capacity group. On the other hand, seven (Shariatpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Lakshmipur, Noakhali and Cox’sbazar) out of the nineteen districts had low to very low adaptive capacity, with index values ranging from 0.306 to 0.406. The aggregated land area of the low to very low adaptive capacity districts accounted for 37% of the total study area, which was mainly distributed in the high-exposure and -sensitivity zone and signifies their vulnerability to future climate change impacts. Critical factors of low adaptive capacity corresponded to the districts’ literacy rate (50.14%), structurally sound houses (12.60%), dependence on agriculture (55.94%), and adoption of agricultural technologies such as improved crop variety (55.75%), irrigation pumps (27.38%), and harvesters (9.82%).
