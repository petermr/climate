 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Table S4</xref>) that the Patuakhali district had the highest sensitivity score (0.655) and was categorized as having very high sensitivity to climate change. The districts of Chandpur, Bhola, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Jhalokati, and Pirojpur were grouped into the category of high sensitivity, with index scores of 0.542–0.604. The aggregated land area of the high to very high sensitivity districts accounted for 41.25% of the total study area. Hence, the agricultural livelihoods of 14.68 million people (38.13%) are highly sensitive to climate change, and this area corresponded to the dominance of crop-based (58.16%) and rain-fed (76.34%) farming; low crop diversity (1.83) and productivity (rice ~ 2.42 ton/ha); and low soil phosphorus (12.38 µg/gm) and organic matter (2.09%) content. Moreover, these highly sensitive districts accommodate the highest proportion of the rural (88.20%), marginalized (37.87%) and economically poor (23.05%) population with unhygienic sanitation conditions (45.34%), distant water sources (21.58%), and high infant mortality rates (47.50%).
