 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Table S4</xref>) that four (Bhola, Khulna, Barguna, and Chittagong) out of the 19 districts had very high levels of exposure, with index scores of 0.560–0.651. However, the Bhola district is the only island district, and it had the top-ranked exposure index value (0.651), which corresponded to its higher exposure to erosion, flood, cyclone, and drought. The Barisal, Patuakhali, Bagerhat, Noakhali, and Cox’sbazar districts had exposure index scores between 0.482–0.566 and were grouped into districts with high exposure to climate disasters. The aggregated land area of the high to very high exposure districts accounted for 65.87% of the total study area, indicating that two-thirds of the coastal region is highly exposed to climate disaster. Approximately 23.33 million people (60.59% of the total population) are living in the districts located in these highly exposed areas. On the other hand, seven districts (Jessore, Jhalokati, Narail, Gopalganj, Pirojpur, Shariatpur and Chandpur), mainly distributed along the interior coast and had low to the very low exposure index values, and their aggregated land area accounted for 20.87% of the total study area.
