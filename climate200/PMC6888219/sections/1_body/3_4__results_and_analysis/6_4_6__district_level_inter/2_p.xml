<p>The circumplex chart (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) for a sample district, Bhola (similar results for other districts are compiled in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Figures S3 and S4</xref>), shows that dependency ratio (DR), rural population (RP), underweight children (UWC), unhygienic sanitation conditions (USC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil phosphorus (SP), rain-fed agricultural land (RAL), crop diversity index (CDI), and productivity of rice (PoR) were the key drivers contributing to high sensitivity in the Bhola district, implying that vulnerability was structured to some extent, due to a higher rate of rural smallholder farm households and their dependency on agri-based livelihoods, with low diversity and productivity of the land. On the other hand, the primary drivers that lowered the adaptive capacity of the Bhola district were found to be literacy rate (LR), female work participation (FWP), income diversity index (IDI), foreign remittances (FM), dependency on agriculture (DA), farmers’ associations (FAs), density of healthcare facilities (DoHC), structurally sound houses (SSH), road network (RN), share of embankments (SoE), rural electrification (RE), natural forest area (NFA), adoption of improved crop varieties (AoICV), use of fertilizer (UoF), irrigation pumps (IP), crop harvesters/threshers (CHT), and use of biogas (UoB) (

Diversifying agricultural systems, implementing irrigation facilities and technology-based farming practices, education, sanitation, income diversification by non-agricultural industries and infrastructural development—especially disaster-resistant houses, electricity, and roads—are therefore some of the prioritized actions to be considered to reduce the sensitivity and enhance the adaptive capacity of Bhola.
