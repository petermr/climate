<p>In this study, we disaggregated indicator values across vulnerability classes in the ANOVA test to discover the factors of spatial differences in the agricultural livelihood vulnerabilities, among the coastal districts. As was revealed in the ANOVA test results (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-04552-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), there are significant spatial differences in riverbank erosion, cyclone hazard, and drought intensity with regards to exposure components which contributed to describing the differential level of vulnerability among the coastal districts. Furthermore, spatial differences of infant mortality rate, unhygienic sanitation conditions, land degradation, soil phosphorus, rain-fed agricultural land, and crop productivity that corresponded different levels of agricultural sensitivity to climate change and described heterogeneous vulnerability across the coastal districts. On the other hand, spatial variation of structurally sound houses, emergency shelters, open waterbody, improved crop variety, and use of pesticides and irrigation pumps have influenced adaptive capacity and resulted differential level of vulnerability to climate change. In other words, these are the factors with regards to exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity that act as key factors of heterogeneous vulnerability among the coastal districts.
