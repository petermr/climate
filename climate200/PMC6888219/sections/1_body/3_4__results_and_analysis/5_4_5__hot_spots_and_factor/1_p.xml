<p>The Moran scattered plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) provided a relatively high Moranâ€™s I score (0.4125) of the ALVI, indicating that the distribution pattern of the ALVI in the study area exhibited evident clustering, displaying a strong positive correlation. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, only two types of significant autocorrelations could be found in the study area: High-High (HH), and Low-Low (LL). Consequently, we did not find any High-Low (HL) or Low-High (LH) spatial outliers, and the remaining groups were found to be insignificant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f004">Figure 4</xref>B shows that the values of the HH cluster were mainly concentrated along the mouth of the Meghna estuaries and distributed in the three districts Bhola, Patuakhali, and Lakshmipur, which were categorized as highly (Lakshmipur) to very highly (Bhola and Patuakhali) vulnerable districts (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04552-f004">Figure 4</xref>C) shows that the significance of ALVI in HH and LL was 0.001 to 0.05, which indicates a strong positive correlation, and signifies that the ALVI values of these districts are positively related to the ALVI of neighboring districts.
