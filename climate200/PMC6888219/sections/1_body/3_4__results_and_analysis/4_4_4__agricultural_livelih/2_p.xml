<p>Correlation analysis (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-04552">Table S6</xref>) revealed that both the EI and the SI showed very highly significant positive relationships with ALVI (r
 <sub>ALVI vs.EI</sub> = 0.833 **, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; r
 <sub>ALVI vs.SI</sub> = 0.620 **, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, ACI showed a very highly significant negative correlation with ALVI (r
 <sub>ALVI vs.ACI</sub> = −0.524 *, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Hence it could be expected that the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity dimensions had almost equal influences in determining the agricultural livelihood vulnerability of the coastal communities to climate disasters. An almost identical phenomenon was observed in some other Asian countries, where sensitivity [

 <sub>EI vs.ACI</sub> = −0.093, r
 <sub>SI vs.ACI</sub> = −0.284,

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-04552" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], who assessed agricultural vulnerability in China, and Krishnan et al. (2018) [
