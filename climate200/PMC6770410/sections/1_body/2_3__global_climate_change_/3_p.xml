<p>Global climate change has been evident for several decades, with anticipated increases in average global temperatures of approximately 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) by 2100, with predictions ranging from 0.3 to 4.8 °C (0.5–8.6 °F) depending on varying emission scenarios predicted utilizing climate models [

 <xref rid="B48-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] (pp. 1037, 1065–1068). In the United States, predictive climate models indicate increases of 1.7–6.7 °C (3–12 °F) by 2100, varying by the emission scenario. There will be an increased frequency and intensity of heat waves and related events, with altered patterns and frequency of storms (both heat- and cold-related) and precipitation [

Predicted heat events and extremes will continue to exceed prior records, causing hundreds of thousands of additional deaths, crop destruction, and subsequent food shortages, altered disease transmission, and significantly affected economic burden [
