<p>Climate change will disproportionally affect certain global regions, with extreme temperatures occurring not only in traditionally warm countries, but also in regions not accustomed to high ambient temperatures. A direct temperature–mortality relationship exists and varies by geographical region and climate, with heat events causing significantly greater deaths in historically cooler areas. Predicted heat-related illness and injury could be reduced with heat acclimatization and physiological adaptation, improving the temperature–mortality relationship in cooler areas closer to that observed in warmer geographical regions [

Notably, not only is the increase in average global land and sea temperatures important, but close attention should be given to the frequency, duration, and overall impact of heat events, during which fatalities dramatically increase [
