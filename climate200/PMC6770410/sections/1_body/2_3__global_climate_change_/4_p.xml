<p>Despite wide-scale scientific evidence associating greenhouse emissions and global climate change, there is limited evidence of emission reductions. The accelerated rate of increase is unparalleled in human history. Populations who are heat-sensitive or possess underdeveloped or compromised thermoregulatory responses will be most at risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. Particular attention should be focused on the elderly, infants and children, individuals with cardiovascular, renal, metabolic diseases and related comorbidities, and individuals using medications that alter or limit mechanisms of heat dissipation. The limits of human thermal tolerance and ability to adapt to increasing global temperatures, even in healthy populations, will be tested.</p>
