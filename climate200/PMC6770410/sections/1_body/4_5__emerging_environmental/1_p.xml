<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) first published an atlas outlining global environmental challenges to childrenâ€™s health in 2004, which has since been expanded and updated to highlight emerging environmental stressors and strategies for exposure reduction [
 <xref rid="B165-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Rising global temperatures and heat waves are only one component of environmental hazards facing children, with exposure to multiple physiological and psychological stressors influencing growth, development, and long-term health. In the context of thermoregulation, stressors including pollution, UV exposure, and water shortages may not only directly affect physiological function, but a complex interplay of multiple stressors may plausibly modulate thermoregulatory function in children (e.g., via impacts on the cardiovascular system), potentially increasing risk associated with heat-related illness and associated complications. Currently, little is known about the effects of multiple stressors on thermoregulatory function in children.
