 <xref rid="B186-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Many factors can influence inflammation and CVD risk, but there is a need for long-term, longitudinal, epidemiological studies to determine the cumulative effects of pollution on cardiovascular health, with putative implications for thermoregulatory function and exercise capacity. Exposure to proatherogenic environmental factors may cause early progression to clinical disease, rendering current knowledge of vascular responses in children inaccurate with the potential for overestimating heat loss potential in certain conditions. Whilst currently speculative, elucidating if pollution has functional consequences for thermoregulation in children is vital in the face of multifaceted physiological stressors, including climate change and increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases.
