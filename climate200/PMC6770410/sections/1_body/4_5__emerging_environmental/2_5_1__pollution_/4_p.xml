<p>Air pollution has been implicated as proatherogenic, increasing likelihood of cardiovascular events [
 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Vehicle emissions are a major contributor to outdoor pollution, accounting for up to 90% of pollutants, including carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO
 <sub>x</sub>), particulate matter (PM), ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including benzene and formaldehyde, and other byproducts. Many of these pollutants are linked to numerous adverse health conditions and events, particularly relating to respiratory function [

 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Specifically, PM from vehicle exhaust emissions has been linked to adverse cardiovascular events [
