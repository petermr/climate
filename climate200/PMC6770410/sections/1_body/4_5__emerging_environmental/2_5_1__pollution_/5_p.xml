<p>In adults, literature is varied, with some evidence that long-term exposure to urban pollution may increase arterial stiffness and carotid intima–media thickness, regardless of pre-existing Cardiovascular disease (CVD) [
 <xref rid="B181-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Potential mechanisms include signaling cascades stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine release, ROS production, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular smooth muscle remodeling, ultimately attenuating vascular function and promoting atherogenesis [

 <xref rid="B183-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Children are at greater risk of negative health effects associated with pollution, owing to a complex interplay of factors, including immature immune responses, small lung volumes, higher respiratory rates, tendency for mouth breathing, and longer time periods spent outside [
 <xref rid="B184-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Children exposed to urban air pollution show increased markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction [

 <xref rid="B185-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Notably, this an understudied area of toxicology and physiology, with only one study indicating that long-term urban residency of children living in close proximity to a major road (30–300 m) was linked to increased carotid arterial stiffness versus those living further away.
