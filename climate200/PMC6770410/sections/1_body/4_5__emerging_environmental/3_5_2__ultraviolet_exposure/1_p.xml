<p>Exposure to UV radiation can have beneficial or detrimental effects depending on a complex interplay of factors, including the wavelength of UV radiation, extent of exposure, skin pigmentation, and other individual factors [

The epidermis absorbs the majority of UV that irradiates the skin, with only longer wavelengths transmitted deeper into the dermis. UVB has therefore been the predominant focus of research, but interest is growing in the effects of the UVA waveband (315–400 nm). Environmental change coupled with lifestyle choices in recent decades, including increased leisure time, popularity of beach/sunshine vacations, poor sunscreen habits, use of tanning beds, and fewer clothes worn outdoors, places individuals at risk of irradiation. This has pertinence to both adults and children; however, some evidence indicates that UV radiation exposure during childhood may be of greater importance for both beneficial and detrimental effects compared to exposure later in life [
