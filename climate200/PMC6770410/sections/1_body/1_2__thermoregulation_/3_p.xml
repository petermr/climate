<p>Adultâ€“child differences in thermoregulatory responses to warm environments are evident, largely owing to immaturity of their physiological systems, morphological, and neuroendocrine differences. Children exhibit a lower Q [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], lower whole-body SRs [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and greater increases in

  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> during passive exercise in the heat [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Children consistently show higher SkBF responses in warm conditions compared to adults, directing a significantly greater proportion of their lower Q to the skin. Combined with significantly lower SRs, children are reported to rely more heavily on dry heat losses compared to adults [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Historically, these differences have led to the view that children possess inferior thermoregulatory responses and poorer tolerance to heat compared to adults, defined as an inability to maintain heat balance, resulting in an amplified

  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> response that may progress to serious heat illness without intervention [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This notion has been challenged [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], with accumulating evidence of compromised thermoregulatory function only at environmental extremes. This warrants further investigation with rising average global temperatures and increased frequency of heat events.
