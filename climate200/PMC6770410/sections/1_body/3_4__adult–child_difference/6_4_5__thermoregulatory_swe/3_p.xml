<p>Greater evaporative efficiency can also be attributed to the lower sweat electrolyte concentration in children [

 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A greater evaporative efficiency and the ability to conserve water may actually serve as an argument for thermoregulatory superiority in children versus adults in mild and moderate conditions. Maximal SRs in children have never been established for ethical reasons, but it is reasonable to assume that in the context of global climate change and increasing heat waves, children may be unable to achieve sufficient sweating rates for heat balance (maximal evaporation &lt; required evaporation) more frequently. Maximal SRs may be improved with heat acclimation, but in uncompensable conditions, children will be unable to thermoregulate adequately, with the potential for progression to developing heat illness if precautionary measures are not employed.
