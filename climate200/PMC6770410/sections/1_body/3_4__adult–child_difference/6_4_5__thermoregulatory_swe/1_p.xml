<p>Many authors have reported lower local and whole-body SRs in children compared to adults [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This is typically true regardless of normalization for BSA or per sweat gland, exercise intensity, environmental conditions, and T
 <sub>re</sub> [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Further, the significantly lower SRs in children appear more pronounced in comparison to adults when exposed to greater environmental extremes, higher workloads [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or during hypohydration [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This leads to the widespread view that children possess inferior thermoregulatory capabilities, a notion that was challenged by Falk and Dotan [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite lower whole-body SRs,

  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> responses are often similar when workloads are adjusted or during passive heating, leading some to suggest that children may actually possess greater thermoregulatory efficiency during exercise and/or exposure to mild and moderate conditions [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This does not hold true in extreme ambient conditions, with children displaying greater physiological strain and increased heat illness risk.
