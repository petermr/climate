<p>Understanding alterations in thermoregulation in the context of growth and development is complex and multifaceted. Not only do children grow and mature at differing rates, but the many physical and physiological changes that impact thermoregulation during this time also occur at varied rates and times, making the pediatric population challenging to assess. Understandably, as children and adolescents grow and develop towards full maturity, adultâ€“child differences become less pronounced. During the 1990s, several investigators suggested that thermoregulation in children differed from adults for physiological reasons beyond morphology [

Children are smaller than adults, with associated smaller total body surface area (BSA), lower total muscle mass, and metabolic heat production during exercise [
