<p>Children have less efficient locomotion than adults, producing more heat per unit body mass during weight-bearing activities [

 <xref rid="B89-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Metabolic heat production can be ~10%–15% higher in children for a given workload [
 <xref rid="B88-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], although is less pronounced during nonweight bearing activities including cycling. Studies investigating the metabolic cost of locomotion in relation to individual biomechanical variables have typically observed poor relationships. Rather, economy appears related to results from the combined effects of a multitude of factors [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Frost and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] investigated metabolic, kinematic, and electromyographic responses of varying ages of children (7–8 years, 10–12 years, and 15–16 years) to 4 minute bouts of treadmill walking and running at increasing speeds. The best predictor of both VO
 <sub>2</sub> and efficiency was age, but specific growth-related factors that may influence the metabolic cost of locomotion remain unclear [
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Resting metabolic rate (per kg TBW) is higher in children than adults, decreasing during childhood [

 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Differences in total mechanical work, stride length [
 <xref rid="B92-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], knee joint range of motion, gait efficiency [
 <xref rid="B94-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], and higher respiratory frequency (and a higher cost of ventilation) may all contribute to a greater submaximal VO
 <sub>2</sub> in children versus adults [
