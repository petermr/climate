<p>Body composition is an important factor for consideration in outdoor physical activity guidelines for children, in addition to hydration, fitness level, acclimation status, disease, and medications, all of which can modulate thermoregulatory responses and ultimately risk of heat-related illness and injury. Although beyond the scope of this review, it is also pertinent to recognize that obesity is associated with a multitude of risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Obesity is a proinflammatory condition that contributes to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked diseases, including metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, and associated comorbidities [
