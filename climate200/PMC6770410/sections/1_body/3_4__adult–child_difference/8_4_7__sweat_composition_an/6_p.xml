<p>Similarly to lactate, sweat NH
 <sub>3</sub> is significantly higher during initial stages of exercise than adults, which is thought to prevent further decreases in sweat pH through protonation of NH
 <sub>3</sub> to NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>. This is also reflected in the lower sweat pH observed in children during the initial stages of moderate exercise in the heat (≤20 min) [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Further, an inverse correlation has been observed between sweat H
 <sup>+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup>, thought to relate to acidification of sweat via tubular antiporters reabsorbing HCO
 <sup>−</sup> and/or secreting H
 <sup>+</sup> in exchange for Na
 <sup>+</sup> reabsorption, potentially explaining the greater Na
 <sup>+</sup> reabsorption in children [
