<p>Appropriate replacement of both electrolytes and water should be achieved during exercise and/or in warm conditions, yet limited data concerning sweat composition in children and adolescents are available, with subsequent hydration guidelines for children derived from adult data. Maintaining appropriate water balance is important, but beverage flavor and composition are of particular significance when SRs are high. During exercise in the heat, children consume significantly more fluid when beverages are flavored compared to plain water [

 <xref rid="B150-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] observed that voluntary dehydration was significantly reduced when chilled water (8–10 °C) was grape-flavored versus plain during 3 h of intermittent exercise in the heat (35 °C, 40–45% rh). Further increases in fluid consumption were observed when the beverage was not only flavored but also contained carbohydrates (6%) and NaCl (18 mmol/L), resulting in mild overhydration (0.47% increase body weight). Physiological and perceptual variables, including

 </italic>, HR, thirst, and stomach fullness did not differ between conditions, which may be explained by the relatively minimal dehydration of only−0.65%, −0.32%, and+0.47% of body weight for plain water, flavored water, and flavored carbohydrate/NaCl water, respectively. Current guidelines by The American Association of Pediatricians [
 <xref rid="B52-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] recommend consumption of cooled, flavored beverages to mitigate dehydration in the heat, with the addition of 15–20 mmol/L NaCl increasing ad libitum drinking by up to 90% versus plain water. Sweat composition and optimal composition of fluid-replacement beverages has been extensively studied in adults [
