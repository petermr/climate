<p>There are many individual factors that can influence sweat electrolyte losses and therefore replacement, including age, physical fitness [
 <xref rid="B155-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>,
 <xref rid="B156-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], and acclimation status [
 <xref rid="B126-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,
 <xref rid="B157-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Sweat electrolyte concentrations are a function of SR [
 <xref rid="B158-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], with higher sweat Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> concentrations evident at higher SRs resulting from reduced reabsorption in the sweat duct [
 <xref rid="B157-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Wide variation in sweat lactate concentrations has been reported, with data indicating an inverse correlation with SR [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>], positive correlation [
 <xref rid="B162-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], or no correlation [
 <xref rid="B163-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated significantly lower sweat lactate concentrations with maturational age (pre- versus late-pubescent boys) [
 <xref rid="B164-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] and in children versus adults [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] during the initial stages of moderate exercise in the heat, but not during subsequent bouts. Despite varying data concerning the relationship between sweat lactate and SR, it has been proposed that sweat lactate is higher in children owing to their lower SR compared to adults. However, sweat lactate tends to decrease with increasing exercise duration in the heat [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], and the similarity in child and adult sweat lactate during latter stages of exercise cannot be explained by SR. One proposed mechanism is the reliance on anaerobic metabolism in a sweat gland during the initial stages of sweating, and an increasing reliance on oxidative phosphorylation as exercise progresses [
 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-11-02010" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanism, identifying sweat electrolyte losses and adapting hydration strategies is vital.
