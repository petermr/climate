<p>For the two future periods under various climate change scenarios, there were general increases in monthly erosion and sediment yields, with several exceptions in hot summer months. In CGM, the declines in monthly erosion and sediment mainly occurred in August and September. There were significant decreases in monthly erosion in August under the scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 in the 2050s, and RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 in the 2070s. In September, the decreases in monthly erosion could be found under the scenarios of RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 in the 2050s. Similar features could also be found in the changes in monthly sediment in CGM. In WW, there were only two significant decreases in monthly erosion, occurring in August under the scenario of RCP2.6 in the 2050s and RCP 8.5 in 2070s. However, the changes in monthly sediment in August in WW were generally negative, indicating a weaker capacity for sediment delivery of woodland in August under the future climate change scenarios.</p>
