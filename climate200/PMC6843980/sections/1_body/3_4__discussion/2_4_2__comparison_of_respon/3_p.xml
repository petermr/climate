<p>In another view of monthly yield estimations, the erosion in CGM mainly occurred from April to September, with the most in July. The erosion in WW mainly focused on July, with small amounts in May, June, September and October. The erosion in July accounted for 73.8% of the year in WW, but only 38.6% in CGM. However, the amount of erosion in CGM in July was still 2.3 times that of WW. The distributions of erosion were generally consistent with the distribution of precipitation, but different in terms of amounts between CGM and WW in spring and autumn. The erosion of WW was significantly lower than that of CGM in months with mild precipitation, indicating stronger soil-fixing capacity of WW to avoid erosion occurring in non-extreme precipitation conditions. The sediment in CGM mainly occurred from June to Autumn, with small amounts in May, June and October. The erosion in WW mainly occurred in the second half of the year, with the highest yields in July and then monthly declines.</p>
