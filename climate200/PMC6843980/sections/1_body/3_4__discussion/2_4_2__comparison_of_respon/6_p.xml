<p>To sum up, future climate changes could lead to increases in erosion and sediment in both CGM and WW. Although the relative increasing percentage was higher, the absolute increasing amount of erosion and sediment in WW was significantly lower than CGM. The peak of increase appeared in the near future period of the 2050s, indicating great demands for rapid response in management. For sediment control towards future climate change status, various policies to expand the area of woodland, such as returning farmland to forests and afforestation, should be primarily encouraged. Besides, integrated soil conservation measures in cultivated land needed to be implemented to reduce erosion yields. In addition, suitable facilities, such as vegetable buffers and artificial wetlands, could be built to block the transfers of erosion for lower sediment delivery ratios.</p>
