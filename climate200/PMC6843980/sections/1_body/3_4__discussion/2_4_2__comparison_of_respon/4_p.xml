<p>Focusing on potential changes in the future, both CGM and WW had higher erosion and sediment yields under all climate change scenarios. There were generally more increases in annual erosion and sediment in the 2050s. The greatest increases in annual erosion and sediment in WW were found for the scenario of RCP8.5 in the 2050s. In CGM, the increases in annual erosion and sediment were significant for the scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in the 2050s. In the 2070s, there was generally less annual erosion and sediment than the 2050s under the same RCP scenarios in CGM. However, annual erosions and sediments in the 2070s were still at a high level in WW, and an increasing trend could be found under the scenario of RCP4.5. Both CGM and WW were not sensitive to the RCP6.0 scenario, under which the annual erosions and sediments in the 2070s were all similar to the baseline level.</p>
