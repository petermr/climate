<p>The current and future average annual streamflow, as well as runoff, groundwater, and evapotranspiration, in the cultivated field and grass-dominant watershed of Wu-Qi (called CGW for short below) and the woodland-dominant watershed of Huang-Ling (called WW for short below) are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04054-f004">Figure 4</xref>. A series of box plots were used to represent the distribution characteristics of each sample. Sixty years of GWLF results for each scenario group were used to obtain statistics to draw these box plots with the Statistical Software for Excel (STATXL). The length of the box represents the distance between the 1st quartile (25th percentile) and 3rd quartile (75th percentile), and the line and cross in the box interior represent the median and mean values in the group, respectively. The ends of the “whiskers” are the lower and upper limits, the values outside of which were considered as anomalous.
