<p>Future weather data representing changed climate status were generated through updating the calibrated parameter set of the LARS-WG model based on the integrated GCM outputs. The scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 during the periods of 2046~2065 (Period A, simply as PA below) and 2080~2099 (Period B, simply as PB below) were estimated. Sixty years of daily precipitation and daily Tmax and Tmin were generated for each scenario and period, which were further used as the input data for the calibrated GWLF to further estimate watershed hydrological and sedimental processes. All parameters used in GWLF and LARS-WG can be found in the
