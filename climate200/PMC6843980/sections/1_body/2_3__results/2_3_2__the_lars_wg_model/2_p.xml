<p>Here, eight weather items were estimated, including seasonal wet/dry series distribution (WDSeries), daily precipitation distribution (PrecD), daily minimum temperature distribution (TminD), daily maximum temperature distribution (TmaxD), monthly mean of precipitation (PMM), monthly mean of daily maximum temperature (TmaxM), monthly mean of daily minimum temperature (TminM), and monthly variances of precipitation (PMVs). We found that most weather items had no significant differences between the observed and modeled datasets, indicating a high modeling precision in this instance. As a common issue among statistical downscaling models with a wet/dry-series based framework [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the PMVs in the twelve tests were significantly different for each of the two study cases, which occurred in March and April. This issue indicated a relatively weak modeling ability of the LARS-WG for monthly precipitation variability in spring. In addition, there was one significantly different result occurring in August for TminM estimation in Luo-Chuan, and one in autumn for dry series distribution estimation in Wu-Qi. However, the results were acceptable overall within the same level of other LARS-WG model applications [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and could qualify for supporting further scenario analysis.
