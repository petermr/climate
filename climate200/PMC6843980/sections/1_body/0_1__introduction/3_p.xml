<p>In this study, two typical upland watersheds with different land-use cover conditions in the Loess Plateau were considered. A series of scenario analyses were, respectively, achieved in a cultivated land and grass-dominant watershed and in a woodland-dominant watershed. The effects of climate changes on hydrological and sedimental processes in different watersheds were estimated and compared. The main purposes of this study are to estimate how the streamflow and sediment yields will change under different climate change scenarios in different future periods and whether these changes in streamflow and sediment will be different in watersheds with different land use cover in the Loess Plateau. In addition, an integrated model application with a modest data requirement was proposed and implemented in the two study areas to realize the quantitative estimations. The LARS-WG model was used for downscaling analyses of future weather data estimations, and the Generalized Watershed Loading Functions (GWLF) model was used for watershed streamflow and sediment estimations. Four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios with different radiative forcing levels proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used as future climate change scenarios, including one mitigation scenario of RCP 2.6, two medium stabilization scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, and one extreme high emission scenario of RCP8.5. Eleven Global Climate Models (GCMs) outputs of two future periods (2050s and 2070s) were considered, and an ensemble means was achieved to avoid uncertainty, the results of which were further downscaled by the LARS-WG model to generate site and daily scale synthetic weather data for scenario analyses in GWLF. The results revealed a general increase in sediment yields under future changed climate conditions and a great advantage of woodland in resistance stability with less sediment increases. The woodland increasing strategies were expected, and various soil conservation measures should be implemented in cultivated land. The approach of integrated multi-model applications used in this study is effective and may also be applicable in other areas with similar conditions.</p>
