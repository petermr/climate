<p>The Yellow River, as the second longest river in China and the sixth longest river system in the world, is one of the most sediment-laden rivers in the world [

 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A large amount of sediments are discharged into the middle stream of the Yellow River due to the substantial erosions taking place in the Chinese Loess Plateau [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Excessive sediment yields reveal significant environmental threats to riverbed routes and aquatic ecosystems, for which effective control measures are needed. The sediment load on the Loess Plateau has decreased in the past few decades due to various conservation projects, such as increasing vegetation coverage and terrace construction [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-04054" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, such profits are being challenged and may be offset by future climate change. The hotter and wetter climate status may lead to various possible changes in streamflow and sediment yields in different areas with different underlying surface conditions. Thus, quantitative estimations of hydrological and sedimentary processes in response to future climate change in watersheds with different landscapes in the Yellow River Basin are significant to local management for better mitigation strategies and more efficient management practices.
