<p>In this study, two weather stations in/around the study areas were selected to determine the local parameter set of the LARS-WG, which included Luo-Chuan (No. 53942; altitude of 1159.8 m; 109.50 째E, 35.82 째N) and Wu-Qi (No. 53738; altitude of 1331.4 m; 108.17 째E, 36.92 째N), shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04054-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Sixty years of observed daily weather data for each station from 1957 to 2016 were used for parameter calibration of the LARS-WG model. Sixty years of synthetic daily weather data were generated based on the calibrated parameter set and compared with the observed data for model validation, the results of which are listed in
