<p>The user community, including ecosystem modellers and remote-sensing scientists, was polled through an online questionnaire and phone calls as well as through targeted meetings at the beginning of the project [
 <xref rid="B20-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], all of which together yielded responses from about one hundred scientists. A key point that emerged from the consultation was that the products identified by GCOS [
 <xref rid="B12-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (water-leaving radiances or remote-sensing reflectances at multiple wavelengths and chlorophyll concentration) might be considered only a minimal set: the user community was also interested in additional ocean-colour-derived products such as spectral inherent optical properties (IOPs, e.g., absorption and scattering coefficients of seawater and its particulate and dissolved constituents), primary production and phytoplankton community structure.
