<p>The cloud screening implemented here is a combination of the spectral threshold method and classification methods based on feature extraction, including spatial structure [

 <xref rid="B46-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). It uses properties, such as brightness or whiteness, which are derived from spectral tests, and also abstract properties generated from statistical analysis of the data, for example, by training a neural network. For each property used, an expression is defined to calculate a normalised value within the range 1 (no cloud) to 2 (totally cloudy). The link between the normalised values and the outputs from POLYMER was studied using match-ups in the OC CCI database to identify the range of values for which the error in atmospheric correction was too high. The final classification of a given pixel is an arithmetic combination of the normalised values derived for each property used.
