 </inline-formula> series are thus brought into line with the SeaWiFS record. In the case of VIIRS, since there was no overlap with SeaWIFS, the band shifting was implemented by shifting first to MODIS-Aqua bands as an intermediary step. Therefore, the OC-CCI record for the first five years (1997â€“2002), the period for which SeaWiFS is the sole data source, is the SeaWiFS record unaffected by bias correction.
