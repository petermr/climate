<p>Uncertainty characterisation is a very useful and distinctive feature of all CCI products [
 <xref rid="B70-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], though the specific approaches to uncertainty characterisation vary from one ECV to another. The user consultation carried out at the beginning of the OC-CCI project indicated an overwhelming preference for uncertainty characterisation based on comparison with in situ data. At the same time, CCI required that product uncertainties be specified on a per-pixel basis. Given the paucity of match-up data, uncertainty characterisation on a pixel-by-pixel basis was a challenge, which was addressed as follows: First, the OC-CCI in situ data described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-sensors-19-04285">Section 3.2</xref> were matched with concurrent satellite observations for all OC-CCI products. For each pixel with match-up data point, the satellite-derived

 </inline-formula> spectrum was analysed to determine the memberships of the different optical classes in that pixel. This allowed us to calculate uncertainties (bias and RMSD) for each optical class, with the fuzzy-logic membership of each class for each match-up observation providing a weighting factor for calculating the mean uncertainty per optical class and for each product. Finally, uncertainties were assigned to each pixel in each image, according to per-class mean uncertainties, with the membership of the classes at the pixel providing a weighting function for the calculation of uncertainties. The process is shown schematically in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-19-04285-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Further details are provided in Jackson et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Each of the products in the ocean-colour ECV product suite (except the backscattering coefficient) has uncertainties (bias and RMSD) assigned to every pixel. Uncertainties could not be calculated for the backscattering coefficient because of insufficient match-up data, but this lacuna will be addressed in the future as more data become available.
