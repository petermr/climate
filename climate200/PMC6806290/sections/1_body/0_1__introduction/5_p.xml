<p>Against this background, in 2010, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched its Climate Change Initiative (CCI, [
 <xref rid="B17-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), dedicated to producing climate-quality data for a suite of ECVs. The ocean-colour element (OC-CCI) was tasked to blend the existing major data streams for ocean colour into a coherent record meeting the requirements for climate-quality products. The resulting time series for the period 1997 to 2018 is the most internally consistent (all radiometric products band-shifted to a common set of bands corresponding to SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor)) and stable (corrected for inter-sensor bias) ocean-colour record available so far. It is complete with estimates of uncertainty and, thanks to a new procedure for atmospheric correction (POLYMER (POLYnomial based algorithm [
 <xref rid="B18-sensors-19-04285" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] applied to MERIS in all versions and to MODIS-Aqua in v3.1)), has fewer missing data than any other global time series for ocean colour. The focus of the work is on open-ocean (case-1) waters. Here, we report on the innovations used to achieve this goal, describing the resultant products and the implications for future work.
