 <caption> Comparison of in situ chlorophyll data with corresponding daily, merged satellite data for the eight water classes used in the study, for v1: The grey scale indicates the membership of water class in pixel. Note the change in grey scale for optical class 8, which has low membership values for the match-up observations. In the computation of RMSD and bias for each class, log 10 chlorophyll was used and the observations were weighted by the membership. The overall statistics for chlorophyll and R r s values are provided in Table 4 for all versions. </caption>
