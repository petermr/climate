 <caption> Number of days used to create a composite of R r s ( 443 ) and the corresponding fraction of valid pixels in the composite for two sites in the Atlantic: The average for the 2003–2010 period. Area one (continuous lines): one-degree box centred on 41 ∘ N and 40 ∘ W; area 2 (dashed lines): 11 ∘ S and 4 ∘ E. Green lines: OC-CCI-v3.1 product; red lines: GlobColour product. Consistency, traceability, and transparency are paramount OC-CCI requirements and, hence, in-water products are only calculated for those pixels with valid R r s data. It therefore follows that improved coverage in R r s is essential to ensure corresponding coverage in all in-water products. </caption>
