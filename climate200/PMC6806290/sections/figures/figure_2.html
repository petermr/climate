 <caption> Top panel: Time-series values of global average R r s (412) [sr − 1 ] and associated statistics (± one standard deviation; 1, 5, 95, and 99 percentiles for v1 dataset). Bottom panel: Number or pixels with valid data on a daily basis from 1997 third quarter to end of 2012. The colour code indicates the combination of sensors (SeaWiFS, MERIS, and MODIS-Aqua) contributing to the data stream. Note that the number of observations available per pixel more than triples on average, when MODIS-Aqua and MERIS data are added to SeaWiFS data. </caption>
