 <caption> Summed probability curves of all calibrated radiocarbon dates from Solutrean, Magdalenian and Iberomaurusian sites in the Western Mediterranean, together with climatic data for the Late Glacial period. The upper climate curve (Cold Water surges) shows the southwards shift of the North Atlantic ice as recorded by C37.4 alkenone of core MD-01 2444 [ 77]. The climate curve in the middle reflects the variation in sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea as reconstructed from relative proportions of di- and tri- alkenones of core ODP-976 [ 78]. The lower curve shows the δ 18O record of the GISP2 ice core [ 79]. Grey columns display the timing of Heinrich Stadials 2 and 1 and their subdivision in an early, main and late phase as suggested by the pollen record of Alborán Sea core MD95-2043 [ 80]. The temporal limits for the Younger Dryas (11.7 to 12.9 ka BP) are taken from the recent compilation of delta 18O and Ca 2+ records of Greenland ice cores [ 1]. The SCDPD curve of the Western Mediterranean matches climate change from the Greenland intimate curve [ 1]. Unfavourable climate conditions during cold phases are reflected by drops of the SCDPD curve. </caption>
