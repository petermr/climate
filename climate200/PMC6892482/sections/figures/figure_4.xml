  <title>Summed probability curves of all calibrated radiocarbon dates from Solutrean, Magdalenian and Iberomaurusian sites in the Western Mediterranean, together with climatic data for the Late Glacial period.</title>
  <p>The upper climate curve (Cold Water surges) shows the southwards shift of the North Atlantic ice as recorded by C37.4 alkenone of core MD-01 2444 [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The climate curve in the middle reflects the variation in sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea as reconstructed from relative proportions of di- and tri- alkenones of core ODP-976 [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The lower curve shows the δ
   <sup>18</sup>O record of the GISP2 ice core [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Grey columns display the timing of Heinrich Stadials 2 and 1 and their subdivision in an early, main and late phase as suggested by the pollen record of Alborán Sea core MD95-2043 [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The temporal limits for the Younger Dryas (11.7 to 12.9 ka BP) are taken from the recent compilation of delta
   <sup>18</sup>O and Ca
   <sup>2+</sup> records of Greenland ice cores [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The SCDPD curve of the Western Mediterranean matches climate change from the Greenland intimate curve [
   <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unfavourable climate conditions during cold phases are reflected by drops of the SCDPD curve.
