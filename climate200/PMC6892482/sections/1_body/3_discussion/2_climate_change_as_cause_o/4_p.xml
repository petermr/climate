<p>The climatic conditions in North-West Africa are less well known, but proxy records from marine cores retrieved from the North-Western African margin suggest that HS 1 was the driest period between HS 2 and the Younger Dryas in North-West Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Less information is available from terrestrial climate archives in North-West Africa. According to proxy data from Lake Ifrah, located in the Middle Atlas, a comparatively wet phase from 29 to 24 ka was followed by a dry phase [24 to 12 ka) and again a wet phase [12 to 5 ka) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. However, clear signals for Heinrich Stadials were not detected. This is also the case for pollen records of Ait Ichou [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and Ras-El Ma [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. At Lake Ifrah [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], Lake Tigalmamine [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], and Ait Ichou [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], dry and possibly cold climatic conditions probably prevailed until the early Holocene, as indicated by high 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> percentages. The Younger Dryas is apparently not represented in the pollen diagrams of Northern Africa. The speleothem of La Mine, Tunisia, shows an abrupt onset of the YD with a decrease in delta
 <sup>13</sup>C, suggesting a colder climate than afterwards. Its continuous growth does not point to drier climatic conditions than before or after the YD event [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. So far, the documented palaeoenvironmental change in North-West Africa seems to have been less strong than in Southern Iberia.
