<p>Radiocarbon chronology shows a slight increase of dates during HS 1, with the end of the Early Iberomaurusian, which then increases significantly after HS 1 in the Late Iberomaurusian. Most Early Iberomaurusian sites are reoccupied during this phase; the site pattern is similar to that of the northern Iberian Peninsula during the Magdalenian (

The Kernel Density Estimate also shows a clear increase in human activity and a homogeneous settlement pattern, which forms stable social networks in most areas of Morocco. These results indicate a continuous settlement pattern from the Early to the Late Iberomaurusian. Compared to the Early Iberomaurusian, these changes could be interpreted as an increase in human presence.
