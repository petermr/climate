<p>In Morocco, the Early Iberomaurusian occupation starts significantly after HS 2, during the final phase of the Solutrean in Iberia, and runs parallel to the beginning of the Magdalenian. Site numbers are low and site distribution is therefore difficult to interpret, but foremost seems to indicate scarce human presence. This is evidenced not only by the site numbers, but also by the results of the Mating Network Model. Interestingly, many of the Early Iberomaurusian sites are multi-layered. This late appearance and the low human presence of the Iberomaurusian compared to the Solutrean of Southern Iberia merits an explanation. We assume that after a major gap in human occupation after the Middle Palaeolithic [
