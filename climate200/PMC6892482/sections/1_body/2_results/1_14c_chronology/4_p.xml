<p>The Iberomaurusian in Morocco appears after HS 2, with first evidences around 22 ka calBP. However, compared to Southern Iberia, no peak phase is apparent such as in the Solutrean. For the first seven millennia, the signal for human occupation is very low in the Early Iberomaurusian (during GS-2.1a-b-c). Archaeological evidences are indeed limited to few sites, which are mainly concentrated in the mountainous North-East. Only during HS 1 does Morocco display a first slight increase of Early Iberomaurusian occupation. After HS 1, during the Late Iberomaurusian, the strong increase of data corresponds to a general increase in site numbers and to a development, in many locations, of rich and thick shell midden deposits, so called “escargotières” [

Overall, both regions of Iberia experience very similar peak phases during 26–20 ka calBP while the data record in Morocco points to an extremely low-scale human occupation. During HS 1 and the Younger Dryas, a disruption is visible in the entire Western Mediterranean. The radiocarbon record supports a correlation between human occupation density and climate change in the Western Mediterranean, although different regional climate regimes can be expected. This requires further analysis of other local datasets.
