<p>The Solutrean commences at the onset of the cold and dry HS 2 after 26 ka calBP. During this initial phase, a particularly high number of dates are recorded in the southern part of Iberia, while evidence in the North is quite weak and only increases towards ~24 ka calBP. For the whole Iberian Peninsula, a data peak is recorded at around 23 ka calBP. After 20 ka calBP, the Solutrean comes to an end within GS-2.1b. In general, the Solutrean data distribution displays a very similar pattern in both regions. This changes during the Magdalenian. The transition to the Magdalenian appears to be a progressive phenomenon, with a first patchy occurrence of Magdalenian layers before 20 ka calBP solely in the northern territories. Here, evidences of both techno-complexes chronologically overlap. In contrast, the appearance of the Magdalenian in Southern Iberia is slightly delayed, and first records are only dated to the time frame between 20 and 18 ka calBP. Moreover, when only AMS dates are concerned (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g005">Fig 5</xref>), a gap in human occupation during the transition from the Solutrean to the Magdalenian seems probable. The time span between 20 and 15.5 ka calBP experiences the development of stable Magdalenian occupation in Northern Iberia, in contrast to Southern Iberia. Before 15.5 ka calBP, the Magdalenian occupation is much weaker here. A peak phase starts only after 15.5 ka calBP, corresponding to far-reaching increases of temperature and humidity during the Greenland Interstadial 1. The end of the Magdalenian occupation is marked in both areas of Iberia by the cold Greenland Stadial 1 (Younger Dryas).
