<p>Our dataset comprises a total of 542 dates from the Western Mediterranean separated by techno-complex and region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g004">Fig 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225049.s002">S2 Table</xref>). This is refined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g005">Fig 5</xref>, which displays only the 322 AMS-dates. Although we processed more than 500 14C dates in the summed probability curves, we have to take into account that the representativity might be below a confident threshold, as our dates span more than 10ka and come from a very large area.
