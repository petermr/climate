<p>For the following density analyses, the Early and Late Iberomaurusian time frames were combined. As outlined above, only a few sites in our database could be attributed to the Early Iberomaurusian, so that statistical analyses are not expected to yield reliable results. Most of these sites were reoccupied in the Late Iberomaurusian, and there is a large number of sites where the attribution to either phase is unclear. For this reason, all Iberomaurusian sites were analysed together for the Nearest Neighbour and Ripleyâ€™s K analyses.</p>
