<p>To follow this, we did Multi-Scale Ripleyâ€™s K Cluster Analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This gives us an indication of the cluster size as well as the nature of the patterning. In general, we note two types of curves: a curve with two peaks in the northern Solutrean and Magdalenian as well as the Iberomaurusian, and a steep curve with its highest point at small distances for both techno-complexes in the southern Iberian Peninsula. The former represents small clusters forming large clusters, in contrast to the steep curves in the South, which reflect cluster isolation. The more intense clustering in the North during the Solutrean than during the Magdalenian is confirmed, as the low values of the Magdalenian curve indicate a relatively homogeneous distribution. In Southern Iberia, the sites also make up small and then somewhat larger clusters, but the curves peak at very small distance band values and the clusters become increasingly isolated from each other at larger distances. Here, the Magdalenian demonstrates stronger clustering than the Solutrean, as opposed to the North. While the settlement pattern in the North shifts towards homogeneity over larger areas, the clustering in the South increases. These clusters are now farther apart, and settlement becomes inhomogeneous. Differences in the settlement pattern between the North and the South are therefore very clear. The Iberomaurusian expresses a similar curve pattern as the northern Iberian Peninsula, showing clustering on small as well as on large scales, different from the pattern in southern Iberia; we should however keep in mind the large differences in site counts between northern Iberia and Morocco.
