<p>In Morocco in the Early Iberomaurusian clustering is low (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g010">Fig 10</xref>) and we can see a very scattered distribution of sites in coastal areas as well as in inland areas, even when we consider the relatively high number of multi-layered sites in this group. This means that during the LGM, Early Iberomaurusian occupation intensity was probably very low. The Late Iberomaurusian seems to experience a relative increase of human activity when compared to the earlier phase. Although site distribution is still very dispersed, more regions with more intense settlement activity can be identified. The Eastern Rif and the coastal regions are occupied more homogeneously, while the settlement remains scattered in other areas. The general increase of sites from Early to Late Iberomaurusian and the appearance of some strong clusters is particularly notable.
