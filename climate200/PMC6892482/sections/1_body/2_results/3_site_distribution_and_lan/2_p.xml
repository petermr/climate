<p>The results of the Nearest Neighbour Analyses are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Due to large differences in the size of the study region, the nearest neighbour statistics cannot be compared over the three regions (marked by the thick lines in 
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); we can only directly compare the diachronic changes in one region. However, the observed mean distances, i.e. the mean of the measured distances between the nearest neighbours, can be compared. These results display the amount of clustering that can be observed in the dataset; the smaller the Nearest Neighbour Ratio, the stronger the clustering.
