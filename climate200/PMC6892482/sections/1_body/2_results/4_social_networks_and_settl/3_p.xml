<p>In Morocco, at a population density of 0.01 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>, the Early Iberomaurusian forms stable networks only in the eastern regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g012">Fig 12</xref>). The situation gets better during the Later Iberomaurusian, but the western area along the Atlantic coast remains highly vulnerable, especially in the southernmost parts. Interestingly, the northernmost band towards the gateway to the Iberian Peninsula may also be rather fragile; further examination is needed to address this observation. This might be an important clue for future investigations on the contacts via the Strait of Gibraltar.
