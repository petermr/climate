<p>During the Solutrean, settlement dynamics in Iberia seem quite balanced in both the North and the South; single-layered sites are the most frequent category in both regions, and the relationship between single-layered and multi-layered sites is similar. This indicates comparable conditions on the whole IP. During the Magdalenian, the situation is noticeably different. The boom of Magdalenian sites in the North is accompanied by a boom of multi-layered sites. In Southern Iberia, the general decrease of site numbers does not change the relationship between single- and multi-layered sites. Both changes in site numbers and archaeological composition point to the emergence of a new settlement system in Iberia during the Magdalenian.</p>
