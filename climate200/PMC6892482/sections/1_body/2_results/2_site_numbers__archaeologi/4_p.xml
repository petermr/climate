<p>In a second step, the re-use of sites and settlement areas in succeeding techno-complexes are analysed (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g003">Fig 3</xref>). 39 of the 160 sites in the northern Iberian Peninsula were occupied during both techno-complexes (24.38%), while in the southern Iberian Peninsula this is only the case for 18 of the 102 sites (17.65%). In Morocco, 7 of the 38 sites have multiple techno-complexes (18.42%); of these, 5 are also multi-layered. Major changes in land use systems seem to have occurred in Southern Iberia and Morocco, while the high rate of site re-occupation in Northern Iberia provides another argument for long-term settlement stability in this region.
