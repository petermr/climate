<p>These regional and diachronic disparities in site density could be the result of changes in habitat suitability or in patterns of land use and adaptive strategies, and therefore are the starting point of our analysis. In order to quantify diachronic and regional changes in occupation density, different methodological approaches have been applied [

Some tools have been previously established for parts of the Iberian data record others (e.g. mating networks) are introduced for the first time. Notably, we analyse for the first time the extent and causes of changes in land use and settlement pattern of Last Glacial hunter-gatherer groups in the whole Westernmost Mediterranean on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar.
