<p>The site location and present-day environmental data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g001">Fig 1</xref>) suggest that Iberia can be roughly divided along the 40° N latitude into a comparatively densely populated and moist northern half and a less densely populated and dry southern part. The significance of a split along of 40° N has proven practical in an earlier study [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and is supported by data on Holocene climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although other subdivisions are also possible depending on the corresponding parameters, we follow this broad subdivision to facilitate the overall comparison of Iberia and Morocco. In Morocco, fewer Iberomaurusian sites are recognized than in contemporaneous time frames on the IP. However, different climatic zones were occupied, and regional differences in site densities within the Iberomaurusian can be recognized as well.
