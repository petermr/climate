<p>Evidence for climate change is documented in a multitude of marine and terrestrial proxy records published during the last decades. As summarized by a series of excellent reviews [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], close temporal correlations between climate or vegetation changes in Iberia with stadials and interstadials recorded in the North Atlantic marine and the Greenland ice cores can be observed. The direction and magnitude of regional temperature and moisture changes in the Iberian Peninsula and the Moroccan Maghreb, however, are subject to ongoing research. For instance, palaeoclimate modelling suggests that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), intensified west wind drift might have brought precipitation higher than today to the IP [

It is generally accepted that HS 1 included the driest and coldest climatic conditions in the Western Mediterranean after the LGM and before temperature and precipitation rose again during Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1) (Bölling/Alleröd). A spatially detailed palaeoclimate modelling study for the Iberian Peninsula [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] clearly reflects this notion of dry and cold conditions during HS 1 with reduced annual rainfall and temperature, increased seasonality of rainfall and increased aridity in comparison to the LGM.
