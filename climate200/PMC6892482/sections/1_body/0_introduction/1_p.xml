<p>Climatological research focusing on the coring of ice sheets, marine and lake sediments undertaken during the last decade has given evidence of rapid climate changes during Late Pleistocene Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These repeated oscillations are expected to have significantly influenced the demographic development, land use and mobility of hunter-gatherer groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Latest advances in palaeogenetic studies of European Late Pleistocene populations indicate repeated migration events and population turnover [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These results go hand in hand with archaeological studies on Late Pleistocene palaeodemography based on settlement patterns and land use. These show clear evidence of population fluctuation in hunter-gatherer groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and have stimulated the formulation of various models such as the Repeated Replacement Model (RRM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which could be combined with the Adaptive Cycle Model [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Detailed analysis of archaeological site distribution and raw material procurement systems as well as land use patterns allow estimates of population density and mobility [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, a methodological toolset is available to test population change, cultural change and its relation to climate change. Crucial for this approach is a high-quality data record.
