<p>Wobst divides hunter-gatherer populations into minimum bands forming a network with other minimum bands. The purpose of these networks is communication, trade, and ensuring mating partners. Each minimum band comprises of about 25 individuals (cited the “magical number” for group size of hunter-gatherers [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and is ideally arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb structure with 6 neighbouring minimum bands. Following his simulations, a mating network must comprise of at least 175 individuals, given no mating restrictions, and up to at least 475, with various restrictions. He assumes that societies will hover slightly above this minimum size.
