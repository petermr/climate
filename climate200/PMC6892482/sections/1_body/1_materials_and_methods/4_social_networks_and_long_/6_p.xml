<p>This analysis aims to identify settlement areas more or less susceptible to breakdown of human occupation due to population fluctuations. As this, much like the previous spatial analyses, relies mainly on the presence or absence of sites, a high-quality database is critical. Although we do not assume to have a dataset representing the complete prehistoric activity on the Iberian Peninsula and in Morocco, we regard the data as adequately robust for this analysis. By modelling social networks in this fashion, we aim to examine the long-term habitat stability of the different macro-regions of the Western Mediterranean, adding a crucial facet to our multi-proxy analysis of prehistoric land use patterns.</p>
