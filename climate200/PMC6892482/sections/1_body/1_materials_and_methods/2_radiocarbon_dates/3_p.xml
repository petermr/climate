<p>Another aspect concerns the number of dates. Several authors [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] argue that a robust dataset comprises at least 500 dates. With an increase in sample size, the robustness of the model will increase likewise [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In total, 542 valid dates are available for our study area. When split into regional samples of our three macro regions, the sample size decreases to less than 500 dates; however, as radiocarbon dates are only one argument amongst many in our multi-proxy approach, and a strict quality protocol was exercised, we consider our database robust enough to generate solid patterns that can be cross-checked with additional data.
