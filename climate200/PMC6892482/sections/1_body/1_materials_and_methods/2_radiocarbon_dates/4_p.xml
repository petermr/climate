<p>CalPal version 2016.8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was used for calibration of 14C data using Intcal13 calibration curve [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as well as for the calculation of SCDPDs. The impact of calibration on the resulting summed probability curve distribution has been repeatedly referred to [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In another paper, we already discussed the occurrence of calibration curve effects and their influence on summed probability plots, and it was outlined how CalPal encounters these obstacles [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, several studies emphasize the need for high-resolution environmental and climatic data, as their regional variability may be high. While in some cases, archaeological data constitute an integral part of climate and population simulations [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], in others, they are only used to cross-check the results [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here we use two different probability plots. A coarse-grained curve assembles data from all radiocarbon dating techniques, and is refined by a second set including only AMS data.
