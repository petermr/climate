<p>Within this paper, we use 14C data and their Summed Calibrated Date Probability Distribution (SCDPDs) to recognize patterns in population dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225049.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The approach of using "dates-as-data" is widely applied [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Criticism has been raised on interpreting the distribution and frequency of 14C dates directly as an indicator of population size. In a study on the Epigravettian in Northern Italy and South-Eastern France, Naudinot et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] evidenced that variability in 14C data distribution is influenced by diachronic changes in mobility patterns. We expect similar correlations in the Western Mediterranean. Gamble et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] state that climate impact concerns foremost climatic instability and population decline rather than climatic stability and population growth. The so-called cascade model [

 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] support this. However, the question of whether the emerging patterns can directly be linked to environmental change is an issue we will discuss in this paper.
