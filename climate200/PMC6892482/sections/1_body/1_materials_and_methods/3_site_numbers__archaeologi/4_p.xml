<p>The sites in our database are therefore classified by their overall stratigraphic composition (i.e. techno-complex presence or absence) and the number of stratigraphic units per techno-complex (techno-complex sub-phases). We separate multi- or single-layered sites as well as sites with material from single or multiple techno-complexes; the schematic is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g003">Fig 3</xref>. This classification is trivial for Iberia, but more difficult for Morocco. Late Iberomaurusian stratigraphies are often thick palimpsests of snail shells, making it difficult to discern clear-cut occupational episodes or geological horizons. The layer composition will therefore not be analysed directly for these sites.
