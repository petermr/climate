<p>Our starting point is the site distribution plot on the modern ombrotype map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g001">Fig 1</xref>), based on the observation that the annual ombrotype distribution during the LGM was not particularly different than today [
 <xref rid="pone.0225049.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moist ombrotypes in North-West Africa, Southern and Northern Iberia are overrepresented in respect to site numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225049.g002">Fig 2</xref>); this points to a preferential selection of areas which are today moister–and possibly were as well in the past–by hunter-gatherers. This preference might have been crucial during the well documented dry spells such as HS 1 within the Last Glacial in the Western Mediterranean.
