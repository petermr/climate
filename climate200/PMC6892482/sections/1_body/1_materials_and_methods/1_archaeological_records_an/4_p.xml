<p>After filtering, our analyses were carried out using 143 Solutrean, 176 Magdalenian and 38 Iberomaurusian sites. The sites are grouped into three geographical areas: the North and the South of Iberia divided by 40째N and North-Western Africa between 30째N to the South and 0째 to the East. Although the IP displays a climate gradient from the Mediterranean Southeast to the Atlantic Northwest and is morphologically divided into dry basins and humid mountains, which occur to the South as well as to the North of 40째 N, we prefer a macro-scale subdivision of the Westernmost Mediterranean in three units: Northern Iberia, Southern Iberia and Morocco Further subdivisions are not suggested due to low sample size and lack of regionalized palaeoenvironmental proxy records. Although we expect that this division will not sufficiently reflect small-scale regional patterns, we deem our large-scale approach appropriate for the supra-regional analytical scale discussed in this paper.</p>
