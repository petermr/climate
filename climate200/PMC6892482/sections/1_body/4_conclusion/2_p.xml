<p>Southern Iberia and Northern Morocco show similar current climate regimes and are thus assumed to be high-risk environments, at least during HS 1. However, the development of human demography is different in both areas during the LGM and in the Late Glacial. In the LGM, with a stable habitation of Southern Iberia, Morocco is weakly occupied. During HS 1, both regions are affected. However, the decrease of human presence as seen in Southern Iberia after the Solutrean is not visible in Morocco, where evidences of the Early Iberomaurusian still slightly expand. After HS 1, the radiocarbon record displays an increase of data, but the overall number of sites in Southern Iberia is still significantly lower when compared to the North and single-layered sites are more abundant. At the same time, we see a constant increase of sites in Morocco during the Late Iberomaurusian. If our site data and the conclusions derived are correct, these differences could be explained by three alternative scenarios:</p>
