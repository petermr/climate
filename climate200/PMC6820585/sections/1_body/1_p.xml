<p>The implications of extreme weather and climate events on the environment as well as on health status are apparent, with young children, the elderly and patients with comorbid conditions most vulnerable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Twenty-three percent of global deaths and 22% of global disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to environmental risks in 2012, and nearly a quarter of global disease burden could be prevented by reducing environmental risks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, coal burning power plants spew harmful levels of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter into the air and exposure to ambient air pollution and fine particulate matter have serious implications for respiratory diseases. Air pollution alone contributed to an estimated 6.5 million deaths in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Heat stress exacerbates kidney and cardiovascular disease, among other conditions. As of 2017, 157 million more people were exposed to heat-related health risks than in 2000 [

Further, rising temperatures have implications for the transmission of important vector-borne and water-borne diseases, which have implications for the spread of many infectious diseases. Higher temperatures lead to an increase in mosquitos that transmit the viruses that cause Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and dengue. Even small changes in temperature and rainfall can have a significant effect on the spread of disease [
