  <p>Conceptual framework linking climate and environmental systems, physical geography, socioeconomic systems, governance systems, and human health systems. Innermost factors are least likely to change; middle ring represents medium/long-term stressors, and outer ring represents near-term shocks.</p>

 <alt-text>Figure 1 is a conceptual diagram. The innermost ring presents the following factors: climate and environmental systems; physical geography; social and economic systems; governance systems; and health systems. The middle ring presents the following factors: health status and vulnerabilities; public health and health systems; human capital; demography; dependence on natural resources; inequality; poverty or standard of living; resource availability; governance quality and institutional capacity; and institutional interconnectedness. The outermost ring presents the following factors: disruptive migration flows; changes in the balance of power; changes in governance leadership of policy; changes in income-generating opportunities; changes in resource prices; disease outbreak or health scare; changes in temperature or rainfall; and extreme weather events.</alt-text>
