<p>In sum, several potential mechanisms link health with climate and instability, along with many unanswered questions. A small sample of these questions is shown in 
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, although we emphasize that this sample barely scratches the surface of key questions of interest. Below, we present a conceptual framework illustrating key shocks and stressors to consider when conceptualizing climate change, health, and social instability relationships. We then present a series of key research areas to address with a more comprehensive climate change, health, and social instability research agenda.
