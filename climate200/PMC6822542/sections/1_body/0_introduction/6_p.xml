<p>In this study, we used environmentally controlled growth chambers to document the early life history responses of 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> to simulated climate warming and drought during its first growing season. We hypothesized that this high-elevation, long-lived, slow-growing, perennial cushion would decrease productivity in response to warming and show signs of drought stress in a warmer, drier climate. We characterized seed germination and survival of 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> during its first year of growth. We hypothesized 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> would undergo various morphological and physiological changes when exposed to stressors, including utilizing a higher WUE strategy and reducing aboveground growth. We quantified phenotypic trait variation and investigated responses in allocation to above (agb)- and belowground (bgb) structures to test morphological responses. We also measured responses in specific leaf area, WUE and carbon content of leaves to test leaf-level physiological responses. Our study also expands the known range distribution of 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> and provides data on the species in its native habitat.
