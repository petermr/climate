<p>SSPM sits at the southern boundary of the California Floristic Province and is also located near the southern boundary of the subtropical jet stream, suggesting species in the park may be at increased risk of being negatively impacted by climate change as the jet stream and westerlies are expected to shift northward in response to warmer temperatures (

Additionally, temperatures are expected to increase 2–4 °C and precipitation is expected to decrease 30–50% in parts of Baja California by 2100 (
