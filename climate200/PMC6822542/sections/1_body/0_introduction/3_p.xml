<p>Making predictions and evaluating the level of susceptibility of endemic species to global change is further complicated when little is known about their basic biology and by the limited amount of research published on them (

The high-altitude rock outcroppings that sit atop Sierra de San Pedro Mártir (SSPM) National Park in Baja California, México exist in a botanically rich area at the southern boundary of the California Floristic Province where relatively little ecological research has been carried out beyond natural history observations and research on the fire ecology of the park’s conifer species (
