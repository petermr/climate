<p>The cliff-dwelling cushion plant 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> (B.L. Rob. &amp; Greenm.) Semple is a long-lived, perennial endemic to SSPM and only found on uncommon alpine outcroppings on the peaks of SSPM, making it a chasmophytic specialist (i.e. a plant growing in the crevices of rocks) with a narrow distribution and highly restricted range (
 <xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">Moran, 1969</xref>). This alone suggests this is a species worthy of concern and would likely be categorized at a high level of extinction risk (

 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> may provide valuable insights into the potential responses of rare, high altitude species experiencing climate change, their ability to utilize micro-refugia, and how ranges may shift when upward migration is not an option. Furthermore, existing levels of phenotypic variation in the species may also buffer it from increasing stressors (
