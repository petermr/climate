<p>The % carbon content of leaves increased in response to drought treatments (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,6</sub> = 7.42, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034; 
 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), but effect size was relatively small, such that pairwise 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests across treatments were not significant (
 <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Percent carbon content of leaves was the only trait that plant age did not help predict (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting the warming and drought treatments accounted for most of the variance explained by the fixed effects (marginal 
 <italic>r
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.22). However, the amount of variance explained was more than twice as much when both fixed and random effects were considered (conditional 
 <italic>r
  <sup>2</sup>
 </italic> = 0.95). Most of the variance in % carbon content of leaves was explained by variation among individuals within maternal lines (
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.84; 
 <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Additional variability was explained by differences between maternal lines within locations (
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.10; 
 <xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), suggesting microhabitat differences experienced by maternal lines may have influenced how individuals responded to treatments.
