<p>Seedling mortality was prevalent across all treatments (
 <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), with approximately 30% of seedlings dying during the experiment. Seedling mortality was best predicted by a model without an interaction of fixed effects (
 <italic>w
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> = 0.53), but the full model had nearly the same AICc value (
 <italic>Δ</italic>AIC
 <sub>c</sub> = 1.23; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S10</xref>). The effects of drought (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.97; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and warming treatments (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.83; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) lead to higher mortality rates relative to ambient conditions (
 <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Approximately, 19% of individual plants died under ambient conditions whereas 54–56% of plants died under the individual warming and drought treatments (
 <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). W + D saw the highest mortality with 65% of individuals dying before the experiment ended.
