<p>In total, 171 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> seeds germinated from 16 maternal lines and six locations. Time-to-germination was 8.85 days ±0.33 (mean ± SEM; 
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S3</xref>). Germination rates began to decline approximately 10 days after seed sowing (
