<p>SSPM National Park was founded in 1947 and is the fourth largest National Park in México (63 000 ha; 
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). It is also the southern terminus of the Peninsular mountain ranges and, as a result, serves as the lower latitudinal boundary for many montane species (

 </xref>). The majority of substrate in the park is granitic, with soils currently un-described. The park’s granitic substrate also creates sparse alpine-like outcroppings where the sub-alpine conifer forest cannot persist and, instead, alpine chasmophytic specialists occur. A well-studied feature of SSPM is its un-managed fire regime history that make it one of the most pristine wildlands with intact mixed-conifer forests (
