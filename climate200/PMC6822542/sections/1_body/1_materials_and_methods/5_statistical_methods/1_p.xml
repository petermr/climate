<p>We visualized germination patterns using dose–response curve fitting to model the proportion of seeds that germinated through time. Data were fitted to a three-parameter log-logistic regression model using the drc package in R (
 <xref rid="ref99" ref-type="bibr">Ritz and Streibig, 2005</xref>). We explored the relative contributions of sampling locations, maternal lines and individual seeds in explaining variances in the number of days until germination occurred with a linear mixed effects model. Location, maternal line and individual plant ID were included as nested random effects in an intercept-only model. We then extracted the variance components from the model using the VarCorr function in the lme4 package (

We calculated these values as the number of days since a given individual had germinated. Metrics for the four additional leaves measured for each plant are reported in Supplemental
