<p>Next, we compared linear mixed effects models to determine the most appropriate combination of factors that predict treatment responses in our experiment (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Models included warming, drought and their interaction as fixed effects, and plant age as a covariate to control for potential effects of age on the response variables. We included the site, where seeds were collected, maternal line and individual plant ID as random effects to account for pseudo-replication across sites and maternal lineages. We also included plant ID as a random effect nested within maternal lineages (

 </xref>). We tested the predictive ability of each of the main effects by comparing the Akaike Information Criterion scores corrected for small sample sizes (AIC
 <sub>c</sub>) of the full model to simpler versions (

 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Aho

 </xref>). We used

 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013</xref>). We tested all variables for pairwise correlation across the study and retained variables that had correlation coefficients under |0.75| (Supplemental 
 <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). When variables were highly correlated, we retained those variables related most directly to our hypotheses. Thus, we did not test abg or b biomass as these were strongly correlated with total biomass and this was suitable for testing our primary hypothesis. We built separate models to test treatment responses in total biomass, number of leaves, leaf carbon content, average specific leaf area of the five largest leaves and leaf-level WUE (
 <italic>Δ</italic>). We also tested treatment effects on plant mortality using a logistic mixed effects model with mortality, warming, drought and their interaction as binary fixed effects, and location, maternal line and individual plant ID as random effects.
