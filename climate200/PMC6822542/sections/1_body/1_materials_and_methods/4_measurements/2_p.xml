<p>We measured morphological traits throughout the experiment to test individual stress responses in each treatment and quantify phenotypic trait variation across maternal lineages and sites. We harvested two individuals from each treatment every other week for 120 days or until no plants remained in growth chambers. We cut stems at the soil surface and sorted plant parts into leaves and stems. All leaves were counted, weighed and digitally scanned with a Canon MF8200C printer (Canon, Tokyo, Japan). We calculated leaf area for all leaves (maximum number measured was 74 leaves) using ImageJ v. 1.8.0_112 (

 </xref>). We weighed the five largest fresh leaves for specific leaf area (SLA) measurements. Belowground root biomass was excavated and sieved to remove soil using a no. 30-mesh sieve pan. Roots were then washed in water baths, sieved again and rewashed. All biomass was dried for 48 h at 60 °C to obtain dry mass of agb, bgb and total biomass. We calculated individual and average SLA using fresh and dry weight values obtained for the five measured leaves. Additional metrics calculated using the above-mentioned data are reported in Supplemental 
 <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>. These include: total, average, minimum and maximum leaf area, stem dry weight, total and average leaf dry weight, total root length, average specific leaf area for each of the five largest leaves, and maximum and minimum specific leaf area.
