<p>We measured phenological, morphological and physiological traits to capture treatment responses of individuals and summarized the natural history of this unstudied species. We chose traits that have previously been shown to be sensitive to environmental changes experienced by other alpine cushion species (

We surveyed daily for germination once seeds were sown and tracked individual plants until mortality occurred or plants were harvested for measurements.
