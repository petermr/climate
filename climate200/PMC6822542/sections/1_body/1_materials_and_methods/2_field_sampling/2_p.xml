<p>We also measured site-level characteristics for a subset of locations where 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> were observed, regardless of seed availability, in an effort to expand knowledge of this species in its natural habitat in SSPM. For 12 individual plants, we measured the maximum width of the plant (cm), azimuth (°) and slope (°) of the rock outcropping where each individual occurred. Since it was often difficult to delineate individual plants, we measured the entire length of individuals that formed a continuous mat in a given fissure and only collected seeds from within this measured area. We recorded phenological observations across these sites and noted whether individuals within a site had flower buds present, were flowering, had seeds present or had already set seed. We also noted species in proximity of the focal individual.
