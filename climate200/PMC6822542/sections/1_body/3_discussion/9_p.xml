<p>Cliff-dwelling endemics like 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> and 
 <italic>O. sinensis</italic> have their own root morphologies and strategies that include investing a larger portion of their biomass in roots (
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), a relatively fast distribution of roots, and lower specific root length to allow them to efficiently exploit the edaphic conditions their roots encounter (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Although relatively unique, non-cliff-dwelling plants can employ related rooting strategies to exploit bedrock resources, even to access resources in fissures as small as 100 μm (

 </xref>). Furthermore, the rooting patterns of individual plants as well as neighbouring species require further investigation since biotic interactions have been shown to shape communities in un-related outcrop systems (

 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic>.
