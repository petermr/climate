<p>Our study demonstrates the role the phenotypic variation can play in shaping individual and population responses of a rare, endemic alpine plant experiencing warming and drought. 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> reduced overall investment in building plant structures and, instead, maintained fewer tissues in responses to simulated climate change. The combined effects of warming and drought increased responses, though these were not significant for most traits measured. However, the individual effects of warming and drought stress were overall too much for the species and caused high mortality. This is most clearly owed to the already sensitive life history of 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> and that establishment is dependent on seeds landing in a suitable crevice or fissure across disparate rock outcroppings. This alone likely makes 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> populations more susceptible to human impacts like climate change (
