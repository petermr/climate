<p>Only approximately 12% of seeds germinated in our experiment. This may be due to dormancy that has yet to be studied in 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> or a stratification requirement that was not sufficiently met. These low rates of viability are similar to other alpine species (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Bliss, 1958</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Stanton and Galen, 1997</xref>). It is likely that seed germination was at least partially hindered by dark conditions the seeds experienced under soil. Chasmophytic alpine species are typically exposed to intense light that stimulates germination in their natural setting (

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Brusa 
  <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>). Nonetheless, 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> individuals produce large numbers of seeds that are wind dispersed. This likely determines population structure and individual plant occurrence across the landscape (
 <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Nathan and Muller-Landau, 2000</xref>). 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> produces only disc achenes with thin pericarps, which facilitates wind dispersal and allows for relatively rapid germination (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Flint and Palmblad, 1978</xref>). This seed type and dispersal strategy likely reduces some of the negative effects of inbreeding that are expected in a range-restricted endemic like 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Tomlinson, 2002</xref>); though no known genetic studies have been conducted on 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> to date.
