 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> reduced investment in the quantity of leaves but maintained the quality. Producing fewer leaves, with on average slightly elevated percentages of carbon, may be an attempt to increase the lifespan of a leaf as it responds to treatment stressors (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001
 </xref>). Indeed, for at least some species, maintaining fewer, stable leaves can be a successful drought-avoidance strategy (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). This trait variability is the most likely mechanism by which plants survived warming and drought treatments. These results could be used to infer demographic processes that may allow 
 <italic>H. brandegeei</italic> to maintain populations in an already highly variable environment (
