<p>We obtained data on daily average temperature (°C) from the Ultuna Climate Station (59°82′N, 17°65′E;

Plant and arthropod development early in the season is strongly determined by degree days, that is, temperature exceeding a threshold (base) temperature below which growth and development rate is zero. Insect phenology models are usually based on accumulated degree‐days (i.e., the cumulative sum of degree days during a time period; Hodgson et al.,
