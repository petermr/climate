<p>Wheatears arrive at the study area during April, with males tending to arrive 3 days earlier than females (Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), and older breeders 6 days earlier than 1‐year‐old breeders of the same sex (D. Arlt, unpublished data). Individuals are usually discovered at breeding territory establishment where birds appear to settle at the day of their arrival (we rarely observed transient birds moving between sites). We defined arrival date as the date when an individual was first observed in the study area (relative to 1st May). Those observed arrival dates closely corresponded to arrival dates estimated from geolocation data from a smaller sample of birds (

 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). We collected arrival and breeding data during 20 years (1993–1996 and 2002–2017 [arrival data were not routinely collected from 1997–2001]) and only included data from areas where territories were frequently visited (every 2–3 days) during the arrival period, from early April to 10th May. We used female data because egg laying and incubation are female‐specific traits and timing of breeding therefore should be largely determined by the female (Caro, Charmantier, &amp; Lambrechts, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). This provided us with 734 separate arrival‐to‐breeding events from 549 individual females where we had accurate data on their arrival and timing of breeding.
