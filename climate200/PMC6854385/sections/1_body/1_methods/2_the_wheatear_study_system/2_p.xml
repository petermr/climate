<p>The northern wheatear (hereafter “wheatear”) is an insectivorous, cavity‐nesting passerine that in our study area breeds in open farmland habitats. Our study area is ~60‐km
 <sup>2</sup> heterogeneous agricultural landscape situated southeast of Uppsala in southern central Sweden (59°50′N, 17°50′E) and consists of ~230 territory sites that have been occupied by wheatears at least once since 1993; each year 120–180 pairs breed in the area. In a smaller core area (~40 km
 <sup>2</sup>, 150 sites, 80–90 pairs per year), each territory site has been visited at least every 2–5 days throughout the breeding season to collect detailed data on demographic parameters. Every year we ringed nestlings and adults with a unique combination of color rings and a numbered aluminum ring (adults from ~60% of all breeding attempts, nestlings from ~90% of all successful breeding attempts). This allowed us to monitor the relationship between arrival and breeding for hundreds of individuals.
