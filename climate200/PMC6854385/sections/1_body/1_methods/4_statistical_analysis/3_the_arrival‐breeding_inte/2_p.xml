<p>To better understand the determinants of the arrival‐breeding interval, we also analyzed it using a more detailed survival model. Survival or time‐to‐event analyses are a suite of statistical methods used to analyze the occurrence and timing of events. The Cox proportional hazards regression model (hereafter “the Cox model”; Cox, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>) is a survival model that describes the instantaneous rate at which subjects experience events, given that the event has not yet happened to the subject. In this case, we wanted to model the probability that an individual bird would begin egg laying in the days following arrival. Thus, this modeling framework allowed us to explore the factors related to variation in the arrival‐breeding interval (this variation is clearly evident in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Because covariates in the Cox model may be fixed within breeding events or vary with time‐to‐event (i.e., daily), we could examine factors that varied not only between years and individuals, but also varied on a daily basis.
