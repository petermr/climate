<p>Many bird studies have shown advances in breeding time with increasing temperatures (Caro et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>) or food availability (Jean‐Gagnon et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). Yet, despite this demonstrated flexibility there are few empirical studies examining the interdependence between arrival and breeding time in migratory species (as modeled by Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, but see Lany et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Hence, evidence is still scarce regarding how breeding time is adjusted through changes in arrival time and/or the interval length between arrival and breeding. Thus, we still lack basic information on whether the main selecting forces on breeding time in migratory species are pre‐ or postarrival. According to a mathematical model by Kristensen et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), the optimal response in breeding time to changes in the environment depends on the relative timing and constraints of the processes affecting breeding time; these include arrival, seasonal resource (e.g., food) availability, and territory and resource acquisition. Studying the details of the breeding time processes is therefore crucial for understanding how migratory populations are able to track environmental change; however, empirical data are largely lacking.
