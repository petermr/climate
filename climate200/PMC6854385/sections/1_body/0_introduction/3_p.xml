<p>In migratory birds, a large number of studies have revealed that individuals possess notable flexibility both in arrival and breeding phenology in relation to warming spring temperatures (Charmantier &amp; Gienapp, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Møller et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Parmesan,

 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), although in some cases arrival is less flexible and may constrain plasticity in breeding time (“arrival constraint hypothesis”; Both &amp; Visser, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Arrival and breeding phenology are often studied separately, but the period between arrival and breeding plays a crucial role in how populations track environmental change through breeding time adjustment (Crossin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Lany et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). If there is little flexibility in arrival times, individuals could still adjust the arrival‐breeding interval (a.k.a. prelaying period, being the time between arrival and the first egg being laid) to optimize their breeding time. Depending on the nature of the determinants of interval length, the arrival‐breeding interval could influence breeding phenology in a number of ways: For example, (a) if interval determinants are nonclimatic in origin (e.g., age, photoperiod, physiological ability), it may act as a constraint on breeding time advancement because these factors have a very limited range of phenotypic plasticity or may be tied to other independent factors; or (b) if influenced by environmental variables related to the local weather (e.g., temperature, food availability), it may enable adjustments of breeding time if birds alter their breeding to suit the prevailing conditions. There is evidence that the length of the arrival‐breeding interval can be influenced by a number of factors such as arrival time (shorter intervals with late arrival; Bêty, Gauthier, &amp; Giroux, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Potti, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Teplitsky, Mouawad, Balbontin, De Lope, &amp; Møller, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), age (although often correlated with arrival time; Potti, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Wiebe &amp; Gerstmar, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), individual condition (perhaps mainly for capital breeders; Bêty et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Chastel, Weimerskirch, &amp; Jouventin, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>), photoperiod and physiology (Dawson, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), reproductive costs (Low, Arlt, Pärt, &amp; Öberg, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), and local conditions (e.g., food availability and temperature; Högstedt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">1974</xref>; Wiebe &amp; Gerstmar, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, it is not clear how these factors are interrelated, nor is it clear whether these factors allow birds to adjust their breeding time independent of arrival or in the context of climate change.
