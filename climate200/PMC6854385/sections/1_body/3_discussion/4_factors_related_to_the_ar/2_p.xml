<p>The time‐to‐event analyses reinforced the importance of arrival date as a key determinant of the arrival‐breeding interval. Between‐ and within‐year early arrivers had consistently lower probabilities of initiating egg laying compared to late arrivers (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), with the probability of egg laying being much higher for late arrivers for any given day after arrival. There was also an additional effect of spring progression and female age, with females in years with earlier springs and older females having a higher probability of initiating egg laying. Experienced females had shorter arrival‐breeding intervals compared to young females (see also Potti, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Teplitsky et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), indicating that interval length may be affected by differences in individual or habitat quality (as experienced females arrive earlier [Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>] and will choose preferred territories). Although late‐arriving birds may have their breeding dates constrained by their time of arrival, this arrival constraint appears unlikely for early‐arriving birds. Early and midarrivers appear to wait until spring conditions have progressed to a certain stage, or seasonally limited resources have become available in sufficient quantity before initiating breeding (cf. Hennin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Lany et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). This further supports the conclusions in Arlt and Pärt (
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) that declining trends in demography in this population result from a general decline in habitat quality over the study area, rather than the timing of breeding becoming “mismatched” to local seasonal conditions. This is one reason why the arrival‐breeding interval appeared to be increasing rather than decreasing over time; it may be that in later years in has become more difficult to find the resources necessary to breed.
