<p>Both arrival and egg‐laying dates advanced by almost a week during the past 25 years with no indication of a temporal trend for females reducing their arrival‐breeding interval during the study, suggesting that these two measures of phenology were interrelated. The idea is that in order for wheatear females to breed earlier and track earlier spring progression (i.e., the seasonal “food peak” for their offspring), they need to arrive earlier because they cannot make the necessary breeding time adjustments by simply shortening their arrival‐breeding interval. However, if we examine the arrival‐breeding interval data relative to the within‐year arrival date (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), we see that early‐ to midarriving birds appear to have a lot of potential to reduce their arrival‐breeding interval. Early arrivers took on average almost 4 weeks to start egg laying compared to late arrivers that started egg laying within a week. Early‐to‐mid arrivers also had a much larger variation in their interval compared to late arrivers. Since late‐arriving birds demonstrate that wheatears have the ability to begin laying soon after arrival, it begs the question of why most birds simply did not adjust their timing of breeding independent of their arrival time (e.g., cases 1 and 2 in Kristensen et al.,
