<p>Second, although the arrival‐breeding interval shows a large amount of within‐year and within‐individual variation suggesting that birds could adjust breeding independent of arrival date, this variation may be linked to the availability of seasonally limited essential resources (e.g., calcium; Reynolds, Mänd, &amp; Tilgar, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; but see Wilkin, Gosler, Garant, Reynolds, &amp; Sheldon, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), energy (Hennin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Visser &amp; Hollemann, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>), and/or the condition of the female at arrival (Jean‐Gagnon et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Rowe, Ludwig, &amp; Schluter, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Verhulst &amp; Nilsson, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Thus, the limited availability of essential nutrients early in the season prevents females from earlier breeding because of its fitness impacts on their reproductive output or survival. Here, early‐arriving birds and young birds (less experienced or in poorer condition) have a longer arrival‐breeding interval because they need a longer time to accumulate these nutrients before breeding, while late‐arriving birds have these nutrients in abundant supply and can breed almost immediately. This would explain the patterns in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> where early arrivers took much longer to breed, presumably because of low resource availability. Also, birds early in the season had much greater variation in their arrival‐breeding interval, either because females arrived in a range of conditions during that time, or the impact of female condition on the arrival‐breeding interval was only a constraint early in the season.
