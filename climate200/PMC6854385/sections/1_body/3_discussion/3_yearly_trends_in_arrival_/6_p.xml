<p>A third explanation for why the birds in our study appeared to adjust their arrival and breeding dates rather than the arrival‐breeding interval is that arrival time and breeding time were not interrelated at all, but result from two simultaneous processes. The first process is driving earlier arrival to secure the best territories (as there is a strong link between territory quality and demography in this system; Arlt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Arlt &amp; Pärt, 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Low et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Öberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Parquet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Here, earlier springs may have relaxed the survival cost of early arrival, given that arrival date is primarily a compromise between early‐season survival and nest‐site competition (Kristensen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The second process involves an adjustment of the arrival‐breeding interval as a result of optimizing breeding time to the local conditions (see also Lany et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35716-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, rather than seeing breeding time being pulled forwards or backward by some constraints imposed by arrival date (e.g., Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c), here we consider the arrival‐breeding interval being adjusted to compensate for the earlier arrival dates that are being driven by nest‐site competition (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). In this explanation, breeding is not constrained by arrival at all, and the only reason we do not see trends in the arrival‐breeding interval is that these trends are masked by simultaneous trends in the arrival date (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a–d).
