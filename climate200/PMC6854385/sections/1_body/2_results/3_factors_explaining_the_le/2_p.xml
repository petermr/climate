<p>The probability of initiating egg laying was related to arrival time at the breeding grounds (from both the between‐ and within‐year perspective), female age, degree of spring progression, and year effect (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35716-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Thus, the arrival‐breeding interval was shorter: (a) for birds that arrived in “late” years compared to “early” years, (b) for individuals that arrived later in the season compared to early‐arriving birds, (c) for experienced females compared to first‐year breeders, (d) as spring progressed, and (e) in 2017 compared to 1993 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The influence of these effects on the probability of initiating egg laying was much larger for early‐arriving birds compared to late‐arriving birds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece35716-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with most effects on variation in egg‐laying probability being absent in late‐arriving birds (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) probably because variation in the arrival‐breeding interval was largely absent at this time (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35716-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
