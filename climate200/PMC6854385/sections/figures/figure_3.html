 <caption> Estimated changes in phenology for northern wheatears from 1993 to 2017 for: (a) arrival (relative to 1st May = 0), (b) the initiation of egg laying (also relative to 1st May), (c) the raw arrival‐breeding interval (days from arrival to initiation of egg laying), and (d) the arrival‐breeding interval when arrival date had been accounted for in the regression model (days). Predictions are derived from Bayesian regression models and show the mean (black line) and 95% credible intervals for the mean (gray shading) </caption>
