 <caption> The relationship between the time since arrival at the breeding ground and the probability of initiating egg laying for: (a) birds arriving in “early” arrival years versus “late” arrival years, (b) individuals arriving early versus late relative to the mean within‐year arrival date, (c) the degree of spring progression (daily thermal sums) for each day after arrival, and (d) the year effect from 1993 to 2017. Plots are predicted means with their associated 95% CIs from the full Cox proportional hazards model, and each prediction shows the range of variation within that factor when all other variables are held at their mean values </caption>
