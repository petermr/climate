<p id="Par16">However, still the effect of global warming on the marine ecosystem can be conjectured by examining the recent available data of chlorophyll-a and fisheries since the current warming effect is projected on the data. Over the recent decades (1979–2017), the descending motion in the WM has intensified 0.001 Pa s
 <sup>−1</sup> per decade (red line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The SST (blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) has also increased 0.4 K per decade in the WM (i.e., Adriatic, Balearic, Ligurian, and Tyrrhenian Sea)

 </sup>. Their correlation in the three-year moving average is about 0.44, which is significant at the 99% confidence level. Also, the abundance of chlorophyll-a

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, determined by MODIS data, has decreased since the early 2000s (green line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The result suggests that this decreasing chlorophyll-a concentration can lead to shortage of food to marine organisms. The correlation coefficient for the WM SST with the chlorophyll-a is −0.71. The landings of European pilchard (purple line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) in the WM have decreased

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup> according to the fisheries landings dataset in the FAO-GFMC for the period 1985–2015, while those of the European anchovy have increase (yellow line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Even though both the two fish species are caught most frequently during the warmer season, the spawning time for the European anchovy is from April to November, mostly during the warm season, whereas the European pilchard spawning occurs from September to May with peaks usually in the cold season

 </sup>. The correlation of the fisheries landings for the European anchovy and pilchard with the SST is 0.67 and −0.78, respectively. When seawater warms, the oxygen would be less dissolved in the water and the more stratified vertical structure would develop; then nutrients cannot be supplied to the surface layer, decreasing the plankton concentration and fish populations

 </sup>. Using other datasets (ERSSTv5, HadISSTv1.1, and NCEP R1 omega 500hPa) even for a longer period (1950−2017) produces nearly the same results (not shown).
