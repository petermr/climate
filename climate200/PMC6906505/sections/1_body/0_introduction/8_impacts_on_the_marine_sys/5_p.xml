<p id="Par19">The pattern of the SST change in the Mediterranean in the future is consistent with that of the atmospheric circulation change. The WM (EM) SST is expected to greatly (lightly) increase along with the strengthening (weakening) in subsidence over the WM (EM). Interestingly, these characteristics also appear in the recent decades. In addition, chlorophyll-a concentration and total landing of fisheries over the WM have decreased during the recent period of the SST warming. This implies that change in the atmospheric circulation is one of the important factors in affecting the marine ecosystem over the Mediterranean. Recent studies have suggested that the serious water-column stratification
