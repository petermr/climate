<p id="Par15">The atmospheric circulation changes in the Mediterranean in the future could impact on the marine system there. Direct variables representing this marine environment change such as chlorophyll-a and fisheries are not available in the CMIP5 projection data. However, the sea surface temperature (SST) can be used for indirectly estimating the nutrient abundance and marine habitat condition in the future. The SST is expected to greatly increase over the WM than over the EM in the future (Supplementary Fig.

 </sup>, although the climatological summer SST in the EM (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a</xref>) is higher. This SST change over the Mediterranean is consistent with the atmospheric circulation changes there (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).
