<p id="Par18">In summary, this study demonstrates the physical mechanisms (schematic illustration in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) for changes in the descending motion over the Mediterranean under the global warming and potential impact of these changes on the marine ecosystem. The descending motion over the WM will become stronger in the future simulations, but weaker in the EM. This strengthened descending motion in the WM comes from not only the SASM forcing but also the EASM and the Atlantic forcings. Both the SASM and EASM forcings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) induce the descending motion anomaly by Gill-type Rossby-wave response to the west of the remote forcing, as depicted in the monsoon–desert mechanisms

 </sup>. The Atlantic forcing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) generates the northeastward propagating wave train to the WM. The climatological upper-level southerly wind plays a critical role in the wave propagation across the critical latitude from the Atlantic source.
