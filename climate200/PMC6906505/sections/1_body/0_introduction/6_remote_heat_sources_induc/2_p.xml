<p id="Par8">The Atlantic source represents a portion of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone or it is considered as an Atlantic part of the whole West African monsoon rainfall. It is interesting to see that the Atlantic forcing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) also induces the downward motion anomaly over the WM. Since the Atlantic forcing itself is weaker (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), the resulting response is also weaker compared to the SASM or EASM. On the other hand, the African source is the continental portion of the West African monsoon rainfall. This simulation is performed to check whether a local Hadley circulation affects the climate over the Mediterranean. The result (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) shows an ascending motion anomaly over the WM, which is an opposite circulation response compared to those of other experiments.
