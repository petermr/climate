<p id="Par9">For a more quantitative attribution, the percentage ratio is estimated for the omega anomaly response over the WM (2.5°–20° E, 27.5°–45° N) for each experiment relative to those from total forcing (SASM + EASM + Atlantic). The descending anomalies of the SASM forcing shows a maximum ratio among the simulations, which amounts to ~53%. Those from the EASM and Atlantic forcings are 33% and 14%, respectively.</p>
