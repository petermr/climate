<p id="Par5">In fact, future change in the circulation over the Mediterranean exhibits a rather inhomogeneous spatial pattern. Previous study has proposed that the descending motion over the Western Mediterranean (WM, 0–20° E, 25°–45° N) is expected to strengthen, whereas that over the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) is anticipated to weaken in the future

 </sup>. The descending motion changes over the Mediterranean has been attributed to the local circulation change as well as monsoon induced heating

 </sup>. The latter is the main source according to the monsoon–desert theory

Therefore, the whole picture of physical processes causing the circulation changes over the Mediterranean needs to be investigated.
