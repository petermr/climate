<p id="Par13">Meanwhile, the upper-level streamfunction anomaly (contour in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) for the Atlantic forcing exhibits a wave-like pattern, propagating from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. To verify the northeastward wave energy propagation, a ray-tracing technique is applied (see the Methods section for more details). The calculated arc-like rays for zonal wavenumber 5 (blue lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>) trace well the circulation anomaly centers up to the Mediterranean, implying that the Atlantic forcing can induce the descending anomaly over the Mediterranean.
