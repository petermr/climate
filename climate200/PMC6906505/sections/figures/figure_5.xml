  <p>Remote control mechanisms for the heating over the western Mediterranean. Schematic illustrating the (
   <bold>a</bold>) monsoonâ€“desert teleconnection and (
   <bold>b</bold>) northeastward wave energy propagation. Red (blue) shading ellipses indicate the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation. Black line boxes show the SASM, EASM, and Atlantic forcings. The Gill-type Rossby wave response to the SASM and EASM forcings is denoted by yellow line in (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the northeastward wave route emanated from the Atlantic forcing is shown as blue line in (
   <bold>b</bold>). The maps were created using the NCAR Command Language Version 6.4.0 (
