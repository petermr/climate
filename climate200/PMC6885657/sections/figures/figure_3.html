 <caption> Example of a zebrafish behavioral assay showing anticonvulsant activity of a plant extract typically used for ethnomedicinal purposes to treat seizures in Cameroon. Zebrafish larvae were pretreated with the ethanolic plant extract (25 µg/mL) for 18 h before acute exposure to pentylenetetrazol (20 mmol/L). Pentylenetetrazol‐induced convulsive‐like behavior was measured 5 min after, using an automated video‐tracking device. Graph shows total distance traveled by larvae in millimeters per 5‐min interval during a 30‐min tracking session. Data were analyzed using specialized software to quantify total larval movements and subjected to two‐way with repeated‐measures ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test (n = 10‐12/group). *** P&lt;.001, * P&lt;.05 (vs Veh + veh), ### P&lt;.001, # P&lt;.05 (vs Veh + PTZ). EXT, extract; PTZ, pentylenetetrazol; Veh, vehicle. Note: Total distance traveled by PTZ‐treated larvae is lower at later time intervals as larvae reach the equivalent of status epilepticus at this stage and are less able to move due to loss of posture—therefore accounting for lack of statistical significance between extract‐treated larvae </caption>
