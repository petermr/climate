<p>Climate change, dominated by climate warming, is accepted by the majority of informed authorities as a clear feature of the Anthropocene era, and is becoming the lived experience shared by many of us globally, as we comment with increasing frequency about the unseasonal weather and the environment transforming around us. The effects of climate change will be pervasive, with no sphere of human endeavor likely to be untouched. As the 5th assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long‐lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.”
