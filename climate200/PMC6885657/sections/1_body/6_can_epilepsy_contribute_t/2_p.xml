<p>As clinicians working in epilepsy, we seek to offer holistic care. For example, we consider comorbidities because their successful treatment is not only likely to be important per se, but also because the control of comorbidities may improve seizure control.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">72</xref> We should, therefore, examine also whether there are facets of epilepsy care that might themselves contribute to climate change and thus, following the discussion above, to worsening quality of life for people with epilepsy.
