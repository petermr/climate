<p>At an individual level as professionals, clinicians contribute to climate change mainly through their travel choices and needs, especially flights; other sources of importance include energy consumption (such as leaving devices on standby; office temperature settings, and the purchase of goods). In the UK, richer people are responsible for more carbon emissions than poorer people: the 10% most wealthy (likely to include, eg, most doctors) generated 10.3 tons of carbon emissions, while the 10% least wealthy (likely to include an overrepresentation of people with epilepsy) generated 3.25 tons.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref> Air travel overall may account for a small fraction of human carbon emissions, but is growing rapidly, and its environmental damage is difficult to engineer away. As an example, in Table 
 <xref rid="epi412359-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we list the additional carbon emissions generated in 2018 due to professional travel by three senior epilepsy clinicians.
