<p>However, changing exposure to extreme weather does not automatically lead to health impacts, and the gray box in Figure 
 <xref rid="epi412359-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> highlights the important moderating influence that health care and wider public health capability can have in ameliorating potential impacts. Put simply, appropriate health care and public health input can reduce health impacts. It is important to recognize that these capabilities are dynamic over time. Furthermore, they can respond (ie, adapt) to new situations. One prominent example of such an adaptation occurred in response to the 2003 European heatwave during which over 70 000 additional deaths were recorded.
