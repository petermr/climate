<p>Existing variability in weather influences human health. For example, during clear summer days there is an increased occurrence of sunburn and Lyme disease, while during the winter, there is increased influence of influenza and falls. As climate change will influence weather, particularly weather extremes, then impacts on human health are likely. Hence, there has been an interest in the likely influence of climate change on human health for over 30Â years, with a significant body of work now available on the health impacts of climate change.
