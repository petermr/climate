<p>Alongside this, the UNFCCC objective is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." The framework sets nonbinding limits on GHG emissions for individual countries, with no enforcement mechanisms. An annual Conference of the Parties (COP) assesses progress in dealing with climate change, and these have occurred since 1995, with many producing specific international treaties (“agreements” or “protocols”) around GHG emissions. This history includes (a) the Kyoto protocol—a legally binding agreement that industrialized countries will reduce their emissions of GHGs, adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan; (b) the Copenhagen Accord (2009), which recognized climate change as one of the greatest challenges of the present day and suggested actions should be taken to keep temperature increases to below 2°C; however, the document was not legally binding and does not contain any binding commitments for reducing CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions; (c) the Durban Platform (2011), which included a decision to adopt a legally binding treaty on climate change; the treaty terms were to be set out by 2015 and become effective in 2020 and for the first time, it included developing countries and the United States; and (d) the Paris Agreement (2015) was a climate change accord agreed by ~200 countries in December 2015 that came into force on November 4, 2016, committing world leaders to keeping global warming below 2°C and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5°C. Carbon emission curbs are not legally binding, but the framework of the accord, including a mechanism for periodically increasing pledges, is binding.
