<p>We are already living in a 1°C warmer world. The SR15
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> states “we are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes … By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared with 2°C,”; and moreover, “Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate (high confidence).” If we continue on our current emission trajectory, then we are likely to reach 2.6‐4.8°C warming by 2100, with recent modeling results suggesting that the higher climate sensitivities could be more likely. In terms of personal emission targets, average personal emissions in 2010 were around 5 tons per person and to reach the 2°C target would require reduction to around 1.5 tons by 2050.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> This is very ambitious and of is of course based on an equal sharing of emissions across the global population. In reality, the rich, Westernized nations use much more carbon per person than the poorer nations.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> There is the potential for major reduction in personal carbon footprints in the Western world typically by reducing the major contributors of car travel, heating, electricity use, and flying.
