<p>Events then jump almost 100 years to the modern era when the first conference on climate change, a joint United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/International Council for Science (ICSU) Conference on the "Assessment of the Role of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases in Climate Variations and Associated Impacts," in 1985 concluded that GHG "are expected" to cause significant warming in the next century. This led to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988, whose role is to “assess the scientific, technical and socio‐economic information relevant for the understanding of the risk of human‐induced climate change,” and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international environmental treaty adopted on May 9, 1992. The IPCC has issued a series of Assessment Reports once every 5‐6 years—published in 1990 (First Assessment Report: FAR), 1995 (Second Assessment Report: SAR), 2001 (Third Assessment Report: TAR), 2007 (Fourth Assessment Report: AR4), and 2013/2014 (Fifth Assessment Report: AR5)—and supplemental and special topic reports that describe the state of scientific understanding at the time each report is prepared. Although there have now been five Assessment Reports (and the 6th is under construction), the range of potential warming with a doubling of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> has not changed substantially from the estimate made with quite simple climate models in the FAR, or indeed by Arrhenius in 1896, with both the FAR and AR5 suggesting a range from 1.5 to 4.5°C.
