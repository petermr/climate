<p>Travel is likely to be a major contributor for many professionals and patients. Flying to conferences and meetings is likely to be an important component of contributions to emissions at the personal professional level. Flying in classes other than economy increases emissions significantly, for several reasons (eg, see

Various websites, including some for academic travel in particular, can help people calculate, reduce, or mitigate emissions (eg,

This is a difficult area, as clinical and scientific advances and stronger collaborations do emerge from face‐to‐face meetings, and teleconferencing still lacks both the personal touch and infallible reliability. But perhaps not every meeting is essential,

Targeted distribution of mitigation measures (eg, carbon offsetting) for conference attendance to those nations most at risk from climate change may suit some conference attendees. Higher levels of sustainability at conferences should be considered: hotel usage, maintenance of ambient temperatures in conference halls and hotels (and personal offices at work), and food and drink provision at meetings are all areas to be considered. Many organizations will consider these difficult changes to make for meetings that often represent sources of income, but as with many aspects of climate change, there is a bigger picture to consider. Climate scientists themselves have considered and addressed the issue of conference travel (
