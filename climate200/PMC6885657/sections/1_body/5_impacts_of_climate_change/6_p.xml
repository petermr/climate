<p>Phenomena other than infections are also worsening with climate change. As conflicts arise, we can expect more head injuries as another cause of epilepsy. A study from a highly polluted city in China suggests that transient increases in air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are associated with increased hospital visits for epilepsy, supporting findings from another study from Chile that reported an increased risk of hospitalization for epilepsy with increases in air pollutants.

 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref> These are preliminary studies that suggest the relationships, if correct, are complex with a need for more data. But, there is certainly a prevailing view that the outlook strongly favors strategies to forestall climate change rather than trying to deal with the consequences on epilepsy and seizures of the complicated environmental changes that will occur due to climate change.
