<p>Temperature can affect genes and proteins. Most genetic epilepsies are due to dysfunctional channels. As in much of epilepsy genetics, 
 <italic>SCN1A</italic> is among the best studied in this regard. Some mutations in 
 <italic>SCN1A</italic> that can cause epilepsy lead to defective folding of the encoded channel: Mutant channel insertion into a cell surface is temperature‐sensitive, for example, with increased insertion and current density at 30°C compared to 37°C.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">61</xref> Mutations in 
 <italic>SCN1A</italic> can cause the rare, severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome. While the effect of such dynamic changes in the context of prolonged periods of higher ambient temperature in thermoregulating humans is difficult to predict, empirical and modeling data show direct effects of higher temperatures on sodium channel biophysical properties and neuronal dynamics.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref> Elevated ambient temperatures due to hot baths increase seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> Anecdotally, the UK Dravet syndrome patient support group reported that during the sustained atypical high ambient temperatures of the summer of 2018, affected children experienced more seizures and greater lethargy, in keeping with survey data from the Netherlands.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">64</xref> We previously reported the death of a young patient with Dravet syndrome who had been seizure‐free, but had been walking outside on the hottest day in Melbourne (Australia) for years, with a peak of 46.5°C.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">65</xref> There are other temperature‐sensitive epilepsies, though generally less well studied. An epilepsy‐related mutation in 
 <italic>SCN8A</italic> was associated with temperature‐sensitive protein expression and function.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">66</xref> Other genetic epilepsies with fever‐induced seizures include those due to certain mutations in the genes 
 <italic>GABRG2</italic>, 
 <italic>CHD2, STX1B</italic>: Temperature elevation can affect brain thermal regulation and epileptiform discharges and induce seizures in models carrying certain mutations in 
 <italic>GABRG2</italic>
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">67</xref> or 
 <italic>STX1B</italic>.
 <xref rid="epi412359-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> Moreover, seizures in many epilepsies, of all types, are more frequent with psychological stress. Climate change is projected to increase population stress levels as it will affect mean climate, such as rainfall amounts and temperature, but also weather variability and extremes, probably of most consequence for human health.
