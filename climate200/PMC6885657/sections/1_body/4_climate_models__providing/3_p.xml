<p>The various choices and inferences made at each stage of the modeling process can therefore yield a substantial envelope of uncertainty in local impacts. Yet, despite these uncertainties, consistent findings with relevance for epilepsy emerge. For instance, models agree exceptionally well on estimates of heat stress metrics, which combine temperature and humidity.

For example, for a number of extreme temperature indices, the spread among the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models (CMIP5; CMIP is a collaborative framework for supporting assessments of climate change and fostering model development, in which international modeling groups perform simulations based on preagreed scientific objectives, generating a database of model outputs with common standards) is less than the spread among the previous generation CMIP3 models, even though the project now contains more models.
