 <caption> ( A) Temporal patterns of tarsus length and ( B) saturation of brown feathers (bottom panels); Plots of marginal effects of the interaction between mean temperature (Temp) and mean precipitation (Precip) on the variation of ( C) tarsus length and ( D) saturation of brown feathers. In the analyses, we used the full range of data we collected, corresponding the missing years to those were snowfinches were not found in the visited Natural History Museums and collections. ( E) Comparison of the first five candidate models built to study the variation in tarsus length and saturation of brown feathers by mean temperature and mean precipitation. A summary of model-averaged coefficients, Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), the difference between AICc (Î”AICc), Akaike weights (weigthed AICc) and the relative importance (RIV) values is shown for those candidate models. Candidate models are ranked from the highest to the lowest (best model) AICc value. Study species in the caption: Montifringilla nivalis nivalis. Drawings: Giulia Bombieri. </caption>
