<p id="Par2">In endotherm animal species, several body traits are related to climate. For example, following Bergmann’s rule predictions, individuals within the geographical range of a species should tend to be larger in body size under colder climate conditions

 </sup>. Body size affects energy and water requirements for thermoregulation, such that one underlying rationale of such climate-related variation in body size is that heat conservation associated with larger body size provides benefit in cooler climates. The deposition of melanin pigmentation is also correlated with climatic variables, and Glogers’ rule states that, along climatic gradients, birds and mammals tend to be darker in humid and warm environments

 </sup>. Darker colorations have been shown to confer benefits in warmer and humid environments for camouflage, photoprotection, protection against parasites and some other advantages linked to immunity, stress responses, basal metabolic rate and behavioural traits (i.e. some pleiotropic effects of genes involved in melanin-based colouration)
