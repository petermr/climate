<p id="Par4">To explore whether and to what extent morphological traits and melanin-based colouration change in response to current climate variability, we used a 100-year-long time series (from 1850 to 1950) of 9 species/subspecies of snowfiches (Passeridae: 
 <italic>Montifringilla</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrgilauda</italic> and 
 <italic>Onychostruthus</italic>), out of the 17 subspecies of this group (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Snowfinches are interesting species because they occupy breeding habitats in alpine ecosystems at extremely high elevations (ranging from 1500 to 5000 m; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), where climate change is acting fast

 </sup> and species already occupying high-altitude areas have little scope for up-slope range shifts

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and, as for many organisms inhabiting alpine environments, little is known about how they are responding to climate change
