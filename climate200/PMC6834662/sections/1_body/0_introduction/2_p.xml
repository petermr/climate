<p id="Par3">Some studies have speculated on the possibility that the ecotypic responses to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological and colouration changes through time in response to climate change

 </sup>. Yet, ecotypic responses to climate changes are not easily predictable
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. For example, while some studies have stressed the possibility that body size is declining as a response to climate warming
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, others did not fully support this hypothesis

 </sup>. Furthermore, some evidence have suggested that the frequency of melanin-based colour morphs in many animals may be altered
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup> as a direct consequence of climate warming or indirect selection exerted on phenotypic traits that are genetically correlated with colouration. However, while Karell

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup> showed that climate warming lead to an increase of the brown melanin-based morph in tawny owls (
 <italic>Strix aluco</italic>) due to changing snow cover, Delhey
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup> found darker coloured birds in colder regions when analysing the achromatic plumage variation of 551 species of Australian landbirds. To date, only few studies have fully explored ecotypic variations due to changing climates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Local-scale studies of individual species have contributed to the overall argument that climate change is having effects, but longitudinal studies of groups of organisms or entire communities across large time scale are still largely lacking. However, they are essential to improve our understanding of how organisms are adapting to the new environmental conditions, either through phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary changes.
