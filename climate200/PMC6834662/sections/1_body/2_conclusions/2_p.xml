<p id="Par11">Even though the present study does not identify mechanisms, it points to a clear hypothesis amenable about the adaptive role of ecotypic responses to changing environments to be tested by e.g. extensive translocation experiments: for example, that over time local organisms should be better attuned to the local climatic conditions (and express different allele frequencies) than individuals from elsewhere, as reflected in higher fitness. Doing so is, however, logistically challenging, especially in alpine environments. A more fruitful approach might be, therefore, to test the temporal changes in genetic intraspecific variability of temperature-related ecotypic traits that are linked to fitness, as has been elegantly shown in the tawny owl (

Understanding whether intraspecific variability in ecotypic traits displays higher genetic diversity would allow to further explore the consequences for population persistence of the potential ecotypic changes (i.e. to darker and smaller birds, in our case) due to selection under global changes

 </sup>. As ecotypic responses to climate change could be far-reaching for animal population and community resilience to climate change, future assessments evaluating the mechanistic causes of animal ecotypic changes are urgently needed to set up positive strategies to diminish the present and future negative effects of climate change.
