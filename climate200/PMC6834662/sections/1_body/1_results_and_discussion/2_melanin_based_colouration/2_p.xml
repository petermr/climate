<p id="Par8">Our results are in line with some previous studies suggesting that darker individuals should be favoured under warming conditions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, darker coloration could enable high-elevation populations to capitalize warming due to better radiation protection and thermoregulation, better ability to detoxify pollutants and/or higher competitive abilities
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, as recently suggested by Delhey
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, darker plumage could confer feather protection to degradation by bacteria, which seems to be more active in humid conditions. Therefore, in environments where individuals are able to deal with the energetic costs associated to melanin pigmentation, darker individuals might have a selective advantage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. However, as melanin-based pigmentation determine the individual ability to absorb solar radiation and gain heat, some studies have confirmed that the physiological performance of dark-pigmented endotherm animals may be constrained under high temperatures
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, and therefore increase the probability of extinction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. These differences highlight the need for improving our understanding on how the high diversity of phenotypes produced by melanin-based pigmentation may determine individual physiological responses as an important mechanism for animals facing global warming conditions. Importantly, recent studies using time series of museum specimens have demonstrated that other environmental factors (e.g. atmospheric black carbon
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>) and anthropogenic interventions may induce phenotypic change in animal populations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, Nearctic horned lark 
 <italic>Eremophila alpestris</italic> specimens collected in the Imperial Valley from 1984 to 2014 have darker backs, napes, and crowns than birds collected from 1918 to 1934, a change that the authors related to historical land-use changes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. This might well apply to all species inhabiting the Tibetan Plateau, where there has been substantial land-cover change over the last 50 years, including permafrost and grassland degradation, urbanization, deforestation and desertification
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, the fact that we only observed an effect of climate conditions on the saturation but not on the brightness levels of melanic patches suggests that the resulting patterns of melanin-based colouration due to changes in climatic conditions might be complex and variable, as its intensity does not seem to be as much affected as its purity. More research is needed to clarify the link between melanin and individual quality
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>, and whether the variable effects that climatic conditions might have on the reflectance properties of the melanin-based colouration (e.g. brightness or saturation) are likely to affect that relationship.
