<p id="Par7">Our next objective was to understand whether and to what extent melanin-based colouration changes might have occurred in response to climate change. Melanin-based colouration, the most common pigment in both vertebrates and invertebrates, is associated with many important biological functions and influences individual fitness via their influence on reproduction and survival through process that include thermoregulation, energetics, fecundity, sexual selection, competition and predation, social dominance, habitat choice and pathogens

 </sup>. Genes implicated in the production of melanin pigments have numerous pleiotropic effects on the resistance to various stressful factors by regulating many physiological and behavioural functions

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). We, however, did not observe any significant change of the brightness level of black and brown colours in the plumage patches of snowfinches (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The increase in saturation levels of snowfinch melanic features was positively related with mean temperature and mean precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>; conditional R2 for saturation of brown and black patches = 31% and 9%, respectively). The relative importance value (RIV) of temperature was very high for the saturation of black (0.99) and brown (1.00) patches, whereas the RIV of precipitation was high for the saturation of brown patches (0.98) but moderated for the saturation of the black patches (0.60). Consequently, the effect of temperature on the levels of brown and black saturation increased when increasing levels of precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), but this pattern was only significant for the saturation of brown patches (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).
