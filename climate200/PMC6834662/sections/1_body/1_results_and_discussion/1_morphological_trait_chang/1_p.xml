<p id="Par5">Our first objective was to assess temporal trends in morphometric features by fitting separate general linear mixed models (GLMMs) for each morphometric trait with year as a covariate. As we had unbalanced data among species, and repeated measures within species, our models included the species as a random factor. We observed that body size of snowfinches, measured as tarsus length, has decreased through time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). We did not observe any significant temporal variation in wing length (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Tarsus length variation tracked climatic conditions over the study period (conditional R2 = 53%), being negatively related to the mean temperature but positively related to the mean precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). The relative importance value (RIV) of both temperature (1.00) and precipitation (0.96) in explaining morphological trends are very high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). Therefore, reductions in snowfinch size are likely to be more pronounced in areas where temperature has increased and precipitation has decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Previous studies using principal component analysis of skeletal measurements have found that tarsus length is well-correlated with skeletal size, whereas wing length is a less appropriate measure

In addition, changes in wing length may be partially due to an apparent conflict between two geographically varying selection pressures, i.e. while changes in wing length should decrease in association with increasing temperatures according to Bergmann’s rule, the same measurement is expected to increase under the same conditions according to Allen’s rule
