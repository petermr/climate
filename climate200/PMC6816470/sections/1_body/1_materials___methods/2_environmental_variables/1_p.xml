<p>The environmental variables used to characterize the current distribution (and breeding) of the pelican were selected based on climate and oceanography. The climate variables used in this study were downloaded from the EcoClimate database (

 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Lima-Ribeiro et al., 2015</xref>). These variables were represented by maximum, minimum, and mean values of monthly, quarterly, and annual temperatures, and the precipitation values recorded between 1950 and 2000. These parameters provided a combination of means, extremes, and seasonal differences in variables known to influence the distribution of species (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Root et al., 2003</xref>). With the species distribution modeling toolbox extension implemented in ArcGIS, all bioclimate variables that showed a correlation higher than 0.7 were eliminated (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2014</xref>). Finally, six climate variables were selected: annual mean temperature, mean daytime temperature range, isothermality, seasonality in temperature, annual precipitation, seasonality in precipitation. The oceanographic variables used were sea surface temperature (SST) and marine net primary productivity (mg C m
 <sup>−2</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>), as they are considered the main descriptors of the spatial distribution of seabirds (

For the analyses, we used mean values per climate season for a period of nine years (2004 to 2013), totaling eight oceanographic variables. All environmental variables used in this study were interpolated by the kriging method, with a uniform resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° using the QGIS 3.2.0 software (
