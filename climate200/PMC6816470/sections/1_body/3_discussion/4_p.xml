<p>In conclusion, the current potential geographic distribution of the pelican is influenced to a large extent by thermal conditions and primary productivity. Under the future climate change scenarios, the spatial distribution of the pelican is predicted to slightly change. The range of breeding distribution of the pelican will be decreased as the main cause of climate change. Under a moderate scenario, we predict that the coasts of southern Chile will constitute an important refuge for the conservation of the pelican. It is necessary that future investigations evaluate in detail the ecological interactions of the pelican and its population increase in southern Chile, considering the different dimensions of the local socio-ecological system.</p>
