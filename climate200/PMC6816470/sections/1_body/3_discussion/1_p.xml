<p>The potential geographic distribution of the pelican currently attains an approximate area of 466,836 km
 <sup>2</sup>, distributed latitudinally from southern Ecuador (2°13′09″S) to the Taitao Peninsula in southern Chile (46°59′07″S). While, the potential breeding distribution of the pelican currently attains an approximate area of 435,640 km
 <sup>2</sup>. The mean daytime temperature range and marine primary productivity explain the current potential distribution and breeding of the pelican, which is an endemic species closely associated with the oceanographic barriers of the Humboldt Current Ecosystem (

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al., 2013</xref>). In South America, the Humboldt Current encompasses the greater part of the Pacific coast. Despite the wide latitudinal gradient, the marine–coastal area exhibits a mean daytime temperature range between 4 °C and 8 °C. This is consistent with the highest probability of occurrence of the pelican (

In turn, marine productivity is the main predictor of biodiversity and especially of the presence of top predators such as seabirds (
