<p>The present study is one of only a few evaluations of the potential effects of climate change on seabirds on the Pacific coast of South America. To evaluate the different scenarios caused by climate change on the spatial distribution of the pelican, we did not include oceanographic variables. This is because the climatic variable “Mean daytime temperature range” was what largely explained the potential spatial distribution and breeding of the pelican. However, further studies are required to assess the effects of climate change on seabird populations, including oceanographic variables. In addition, it is important to recognize that the species spatial distribution models have methodological constraints, including operating based on climatic variables without integrating ecological interactions (
