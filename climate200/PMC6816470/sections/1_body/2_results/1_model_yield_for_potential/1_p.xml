<p>The model of presence with the best fit showed a gain of 3.04 and a Boyce Index of 0.99. Also, an AUC
 <sub>training</sub> of 0.98 and an AUC
 <sub>evaluation</sub> of 0.98 and a standard deviation of 0.004. While the modeling of breeding distribution showed a gain of 2.24 and a Boyce Index of 0.98, with an AUC
 <sub>training</sub> of 0.98 and an AUC
 <sub>evaluation</sub> of 0.98 and a standard deviation of 0.003. The AUC values were relatively similar, so the models used are appropriate for predicting the presence and breeding distribution of the species. AUC
 <sub>evaluation</sub> 0.98 indicates that the pelican has a wide geographic distribution and breeding in relation to the area corresponding to the environmental data. The model predicts that the potential geographic distribution of the pelican reaches an approximate surface area of 466,836 km
 <sup>2</sup>, latitudinally distributed from southern Ecuador (2°13′09″S) to southern Chile (46°59′07″S). Over this extensive marine–coastal surface, the probability of occurrence for this species varied between a 0.16 (minimum) and 0.84 (maximum) (
