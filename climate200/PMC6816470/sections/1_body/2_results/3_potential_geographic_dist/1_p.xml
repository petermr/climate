<p>Based on the six climatic variables selected in the study, the model predicts that the projected pelican distribution currently attains an area of 596,753 km
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This area is larger than that initially projected (466,836 km
 <sup>2</sup>), where the oceanographic variables were integrated. Regarding the projections of climate change for 2100, under the moderate scenario of 2.6 rcp a slight decrease (âˆ’0.68%) in pelican spatial distribution is predicted (
