<p>For the case of the modeling of breeding distribution, an area of 435,640 km
 <sup>2</sup> is projected (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Regarding the projections of climate change for 2100, under the moderate scenario of 2.6 rcp an increase (8.77%) in pelican breeding distribution is predicted (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Under the severe scenario of 8.5 rcp, a decrease (âˆ’19.30%) in pelican breeding distribution is predicted (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Under the severe scenario, the model predicts a decrease of occurrence probability of nesting sites of the pelican in northern Ecuador and north-central Chile (
