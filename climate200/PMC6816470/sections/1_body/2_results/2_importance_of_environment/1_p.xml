<p>Among the six climatic variables and eight oceanographic variables, the mean daytime temperature range (Bio2) and the summer marine primary productivity, contributed the most to the current and potential distribution of the pelican (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These two factors explained 78.47% of the modeled distribution. The mean daytime temperature responded to the probability of the presence of the pelican, with a high probability of finding the species in areas where the mean daytime temperature ranges between 6 and 8 Â°C. In turn, the summer marine primary productivity also influenced the probability of the presence of the pelican, with a greater probability of finding the species during the summer season in areas with high primary productivity. The other factors such as, spring marine primary productivity, isothermality, and seasonality in temperature, contributed 9.24%, 3.23%, and 1.74%, respectively, to the modeled distribution. Therefore, thermal and primary productivity conditions are more important than other variables for mapping pelican distribution (
