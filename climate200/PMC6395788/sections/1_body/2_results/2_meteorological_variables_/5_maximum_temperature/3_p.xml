<p id="p0185">The distribution of maximum temperature data is similar in the treatments throughout the measured period, but the full sun presented higher amount of inferior outliers when compared to other treatments. Monthly, we observed the same maximum temperature pattern with the highest maximum temperature in the full sun system. In May, June, and August, the maximum temperature attenuation was 0.6 °C in the SH3 treatment. In May and August, SH2 treatment had the maximum temperature reduced by 0.4 °C. The highest temperature reductions occurred in May and August, when SH3 system recorded 0.56 °C and 0.63 °C lower than full sun, respectively. The difference was higher in drier months (May, June, July, August, and September) than in wetter months (October, November, and December). The differences are presented in
