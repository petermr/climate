<p id="p0210">For relative humidity, the best correlation occurred in the second day of simulation, ranging from 0.89 to 0.97. Shaded treatments presented better agreement indexes than full sun system. In this context, SH3 (higher shade) had the best agreement index (0.89), followed by SH2 (0.87), SH1 (0.85), and full sun (0.84). The largest residual errors occurred during the wettest hours of the day (at night).</p>
