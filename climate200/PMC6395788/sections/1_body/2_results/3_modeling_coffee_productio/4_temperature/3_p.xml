<p id="p0225">In average, for all treatments, the model tends to overestimate the temperature. During the day (from 7 am to 5 pm), the temperature was 2.2 °C overestimated (in average, for all treatments), and during the night (6 pm–6 am), the temperature was 1.3 °C overestimated. SH2 simulation presented less variance, errors, and percentage of errors, followed by SH1, full sun, and SH3.</p>
