<p id="p0050">The understanding of how high temperatures may be reduced in coffee production systems through the microclimate modification provided by shade cover is still limited (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ambrosini et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Middel et al., 2014</xref>). The software allows the user to design an area (such as trees and buildings) providing real meteorological data as input parameters for simulations, and surface-to-atmosphere interactions. However, the model has never been used to simulate coffee production systems.
