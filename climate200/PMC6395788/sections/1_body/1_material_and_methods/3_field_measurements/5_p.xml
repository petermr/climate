<p id="p0090">We also measured the following parameters related to the 10 shading trees chosen: (i) basal circumference at 10 cm from ground level (bc10 cm), (ii) diameter at breast height (DBH), (iii) plant height (h), and (iv) leaf area index (LAI). To calculate coffee and shading tree LAI, we used the instrument LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, operated with one sensor mode. The mode makes two measurements: out of canopy and below canopy. The measurement was done according to the operation mode described in LAI 2000 manual, beginning with out of canopy reading (open sky) to calibrate the sensor, and then, the below canopy reading. We used 270Â° view cap to avoid interferences (operator, soil, etc). We did all the measurements in stable sky conditions, at sunset.</p>
