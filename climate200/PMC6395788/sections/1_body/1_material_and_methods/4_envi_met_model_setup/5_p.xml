<p id="p0135">To model coffee plants, we assumed that coffee architecture may be represented by a cylinder (representing the stem), and a cone (representing the canopy), as suggested by 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Favarin et al. (2002)</xref> and illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. After that, the tree was divided in ten parts (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c), and the LAI - leaf area index - was proportionally distributed in the canopy parts (part 1 to 7 in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c), as required by Envi-met software. To model shaded trees, we used the Envi-met library, adding real characteristics measured in field area as Leaf Area index (LAI), plant height (h), diameter at breast height (DBH), and basal circumference.
