<p id="p0145">We used temperature, relative humidity, and radiation of full sun (control) meteorological station in an hourly basis as initial data input. Meteorological receptors were created in the model for the same locations and at the same height, as those installed in the field, to be comparable. The simulation was done choosing predominantly cloudless days (14
 <sup>th</sup>, 15
 <sup>th,</sup> and 16
 <sup>th</sup> of September). After that, we assessed the model performance, comparing it to real data.
