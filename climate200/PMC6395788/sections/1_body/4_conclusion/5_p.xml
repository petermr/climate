<p id="p0335">The results show that Envi-met system is adequate to model coffee systems with accuracy, reproducing radiation, temperature, and humidity patterns. This study proposes microclimate model ENVI-met as an option and efficient tool for managing shaded-grown coffee analysis. Additional assessment of the model is necessary, using other data sheets in different environments, crops, and climate conditions to make it largely used in agricultural planning.</p>
