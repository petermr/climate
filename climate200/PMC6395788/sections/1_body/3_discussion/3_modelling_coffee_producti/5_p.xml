<p id="p0305">The systematic errors (RMSE) of temperature ranged from 2.82 to 3.5 °C, which is superior to the error found in the South of China by 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2013)</xref>, and in Germany by 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Jänicke et al. (2015)</xref>
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2016)</xref>. It may be attributed to the high values measured and not observed in other studies. 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Acero and Arrizabalaga (2016)</xref> found similar results for high values. Additionally, the simulation has to start in the beginning of the day, due to the neutral atmosphere, avoiding errors in radiation pattern.
