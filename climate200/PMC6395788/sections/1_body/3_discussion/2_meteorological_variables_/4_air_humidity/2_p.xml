<p id="p0250">In addition to total wind reduction, SH3 also presented higher relative humidity in the driest period, suggesting that the shaded-grown system presented more humidity in the driest period of the year. Air humidity affects coffee vegetation growth and evapotranspiration (

On the other hand, the humidity registered in SH2 and SH3 was not very high in rainy season, suggesting that the shaded schemes do not raise the humidity significantly in the Arabica coffee canopy. This is especially important to avoid diseases (
