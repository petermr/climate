Adaptation is therefore required and, since shade management reduces temperature, the practice may be considered a significant option to adapt coffee to climate change. However, as suggested in this study, the low level of shades may not reduce temperature in the blossoming period, but may reduce it along the year. Therefore, it is essential to plan shade schemes to reduce thermal stress.
