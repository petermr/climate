 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brenner et al. (1995)</xref> reports that under protected crop conditions by windbreaks, where the radiation incidence is similar to unprotected crops, diurnal temperatures are higher due to lower movement of atmospheric air, which changes the energy balance, increasing the sensible heat flow. High diurnal temperatures in crops protected by windbreaks, when the incidence of solar radiation is similar to unprotected crops, were also obtained by
