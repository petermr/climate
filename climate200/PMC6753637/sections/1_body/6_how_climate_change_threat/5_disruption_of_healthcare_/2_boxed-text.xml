  <title>Low health risk country: hurricane Maria in the United States</title>
  <p>Hurricane Maria struck the US in 2017, causing major damage to Puerto Rico. Devastating rainfall and landslides, both attributed to climate change, battered the island.
   <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Combined with ineffective governance and disaster relief from the US government, the storm took a major toll on the island. The initial death count was 64, but subsequent household survey estimates place the loss of life at nearly 5700.
   <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The average household went 84 days without electricity, 68 days without water, and 41 days without cellular phone coverage.
   <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
  </p>
  <p>Nearly a third of households reported a disruption to health services, including 14% who were unable to access medications, 10% who were unable to use medical device equipment that required power, 9% who reported closed medical facilities, and 6% who found a lack of doctors. Nearly 9% of the most remote households could not reach emergency medical services by phone.

  </p>
  <p>Healthcare disruption was not limited to Puerto Rico. Approximately 44% of US intravenous fluid was produced on this island, and damage to the factory led to shortages that lasted months at hospitals throughout the US and other countries.
   <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The cascading effects of this one storm show how vulnerable supply chains are and the importance of fortifying climate resilience in healthcare systems.

  <title>High health risk country: Bangladesh and flooding of the Brahmaputra River</title>
  <p>Bangladesh is a low lying, densely populated country with enormous vulnerability to rising sea levels and climate driven extreme weather, including flooding, cyclones, and drought.
   <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In 2017, climate change (along with other factors, such as deforestation and higher population density) contributed to the flooding of the Brahmaputra River, which destroyed nearly 500 community health clinics. This is catastrophic in a country with approximately five medical doctors and eight hospital beds per 10 000 people.
   <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The destruction of already limited healthcare infrastructure had a drastic effect on access to care.
  </p>
  <p>Solutions are difficult, as the climate driven weather is constantly creating and destroying floating islands, which makes establishing permanent clinics or hospitals impossible. Forced to develop innovative solutions, some communities have launched “floating hospitals.”
   <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These consist of boats that bring basic medical services to people who live in the riverine islands. A boat can see about 60 000 patients a year over hundreds of miles. Countries already at extreme risk, like Bangladesh, represent early examples of the enormous climate change related healthcare challenges we face and the need for creative solutions.
