Climate change threatens the very tenets of UHC; the regions of the world most vulnerable to climate change face the greatest difficulties in achieving it.</p><p>United Nations countries agreed to achieve UHC by 2030, which requires optimal access to essential, high quality services without sacrificing affordability.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This extends beyond merely providing &#x0201c;coverage&#x0201d; and has three main components: a broad set of healthcare services must be accessible, affordable, and of sufficiently high quality to improve health outcomes. To track progress on SDG 3.8, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank created a service coverage index to measure the extent of coverage of &#x0201c;essential health services.&#x0201d; Although coverage has increased globally, only 22 countries currently have a &#x0201c;high coverage&#x0201d; index.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

</p><p>Ensuring that a largely stationary population can access a broad set of high quality services is hard enough; delivering UHC to a migratory population is substantially more challenging. Chad, for example, is experiencing increased migration secondary to drought with concerns for strain on public health services and health complications.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Displaced populations have distinct health related needs, as they may have different rates of conditions, face mental health problems, and bring novel diseases.

People might be unable to access care due to transportation difficulties, caused by road damage or the unavailability of emergency medical services.

These many obstacles are likely to place additional cost burdens on health systems, which will trickle down to the individual or insurance provider, further exacerbating affordability concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Health workforce disruptions and impairments</title><p>There is already a shortage and maldistribution of well trained healthcare workers around the world.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This is likely to be exacerbated by climate change, as the workforce is also affected by the forces driving migration.

<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Only 19% of disease control workers in China understood that poor people were at greater risk of climate change related health problems.

Meanwhile, we need investment in research to understand the health risks of climate change in local populations. There then needs to be political and fiscal support to translate this research into interventions and infrastructure that protect the most vulnerable. Another essential component of achieving UHC is the development of a dynamic health workforce that can respond to the changing needs of a region.

This mandates global assessments of climate hazards and health system vulnerabilities, which can then be tailored to unique local environments. The results of these assessments can then be implemented into strategic capital investment priorities and appropriate health workforce management.
