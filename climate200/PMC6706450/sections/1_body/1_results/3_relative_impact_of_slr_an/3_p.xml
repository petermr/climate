<p id="Par16">Increasing flood levels induced by TC climatology change, especially in lower-latitude regions, suggest that the frequency, intensity, and/or size of TCs could increase by the end of 21st century. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows that the frequency, intensity, and size of NCEP-based historical TCs off the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts greatly varies as a function of latitude. While the TC frequency and intensity (represented by maximum wind speed V
 <sub>max</sub>) are higher in the Gulf of Mexico and southeast Atlantic regions, the TC size (represented by radius of maximum wind speed R
 <sub>max</sub>) is larger in the mid-Atlantic and New England regions. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows that both the intensity and size of TCs off the entire US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts increase from the historical period to the future period (up to a 21% increase). In particular, the index V
 <sub>max</sub>
 <sup>2</sup>R
 <sub>max</sub>, which we use here as a consolidated measure of TC intensity and size, increases in the entire basin with the largest increase in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the large values of

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Changes in the TC frequency, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, reveal a larger increase for the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico than the Gulf ’s eastern and western coasts, explaining the larger

In addition, our analysis of TC translation speed, not shown here, reveals an increase in the number of slow-moving TCs and a decrease in the number of fast-moving TCs. Slower TCs allow winds to blow onshore for longer periods of time, resulting in possibly larger and longer coastal flooding.
