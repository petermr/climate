<p id="Par11">Along coastal counties in the Gulf of Mexico region, the best estimate of 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> is between 1.5 and 2.80 m, with an average value of 2 m (66% increase in the average

 <sub>100 year</sub>). The largest 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> is projected to be between 2 and 2.8 m along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas). The average very likely (5th–95th percentile) range of 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> changes from 2.38–4.16 m in the historical period to 4.19–6.62 m in the future period for the Gulf of Mexico region. The best estimate of 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> is between 1.34 and 1.85 m (average change of 1.52 m; 104% increase) in the southeast Atlantic region and between 1.43 and 1.92 m (average change of 1.67 m; 200% increase) in the mid-Atlantic region. The average very likely estimate of 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> changes from 1.03–2.32 m to 2.6–3.87 m in the southeast Atlantic region and from 0.65–1.21 m to 2.24–3.10 m in the mid-Atlantic region. The best estimate of 
 <italic>∆η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> for the New England region is between 1.55 and 1.82 m (average change of 1.68 m; 255%). The average very likely estimate of 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sub>100 year</sub> in this region changes from 0.56–0.89 m to 2.23–2.62 m.
