 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> displays the spatial distribution of the estimated 100-year flood level along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The NCEP-based best estimate of 100-year flood level (

 <sub>100–yr</sub>) for the historical period varies greatly along the coast (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>): it is between 1.53 and 4.30 m (with the average over all counties of 3.03 m) in the Gulf of Mexico, 0.52 and 2.82 m (1.46 m) in the southeast Atlantic, 0.27 and 1.67 m (0.84 m) in the mid-Atlantic, and 0.48 and 1.20 m (0.66 m) in the New England regions.
