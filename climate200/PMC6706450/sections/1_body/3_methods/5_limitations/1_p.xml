<p id="Par32">There are some limitations to the results presented in this paper. The hydrodynamic model neglects the wave setup (i.e., the water level increase at the coast due to breaking waves in the surf zone). Wave setup can increase the flood levels up to a few tens of centimetres

 </sup>. The wave setup can be computed by coupling the hydrodynamic model with a spectral wave model. However, the computational cost would increase significantly (note that we simulated about 65,000 synthetic TCs). Another limitation of the hydrodynamic model is the spatial resolution of the computational mesh, which is about 1 km along the coastlines. A higher resolution mesh could reduce numerical errors and better resolve physical processes especially the wave setup (when the hydrodynamic model is coupled with a wave model as in ref.

 </sup>). The basin-scale computational mesh does not cover coastal floodplains. Including the floodplains requires a higher resolution mesh that resolves the complex features of coastal areas especially in urbanized regions (e.g., flood protection systems, roads, narrow waterways, etc.). These components may be incorporated in future assessments when computational resources allow.
