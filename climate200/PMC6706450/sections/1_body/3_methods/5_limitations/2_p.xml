<p id="Par33">We assume that SLR and storm tides are independent and, thus, the nonlinear interactions are neglected. Although the nonlinear effects have been shown to be negligible for some coastal areas

 </sup>. Accounting for this nonlinear interaction through direct simulation is computationally expensive, if possible, for full probabilistic assessments, as it would require simulating numerous combinations of all possible storms and SLR scenarios. (Direct simulations may be applied for studies with substantially reduced number of scenarios, for example, through focusing on a few selected SLR scenarios
 <sup>

 </sup>). Developing parametric approximations may be necessary. Ultimately, SLR and storm climatology changes are correlated in the climate and ocean system

 </sup>. Here they are assumed independent conditioned on the emission scenario (RCP 8.5) and the overall climate modeling (CMIP5). An integrated modeling framework that can estimate SLR and storm activity together for each climate projection may help both accounting for their correlation more accurately and providing reduced sample sizes that can be directly simulated to fully account for the nonlinear interactions between SLR and storm tides.
