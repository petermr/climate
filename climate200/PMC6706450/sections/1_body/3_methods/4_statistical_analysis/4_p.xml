<p id="Par31">In addition to the future projection of storm tides from each climate model, we also calculate a single composite projection which represents the weighted–average value over all climate models. The weighting factor assigned to each climate model is determined by comparing the NCEP-based storm tide return levels with those projected by the climate models for the historical period. Specifically, the weighting factor 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> of the climate model 
 <italic>i</italic> is simply calculated as 
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>/∑S
 <sub>i</sub>, where 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> is the Wilmott skill score (0 &lt; 
 <italic>S</italic> &lt; 1, 
 <italic>S</italic> = 1 means a perfect fit) for estimating the storm tide return levels.
