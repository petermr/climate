<p id="Par4">Quantifying large-scale TC flood variations in the future climate is challenging for two reasons. First, most reanalysis datasets and global circulation models (GCMs) cannot resolve TCs well due to their relatively low resolutions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, recent studies which assessed global scale flood hazards using these models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup> accounted for ETCs well but not TCs. In recent years, a few high–resolution GCMs and regional downscaled climate models have been developed to study TCs in a warming climate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. These models are still computationally expensive and thus not practical for flood hazard assessment studies, which should consider large spectra of storm scenarios in order to address hazards induced by low-probability, high-consequence events
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. An effective approach is to statistically generate large samples of synthetic TCs for reanalysis or GCM-projected climate conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> to drive hydrodynamic modeling and assess flood hazards. This climatological–hydrodynamic approach
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, however, induces the second challenge: balancing accuracy and efficiency in hydrodynamic modeling. In order to accurately estimate floods, hydrodynamic modeling is often performed on high-resolution numerical meshes that can capture complex coastal bathymetry and topography. Thus, the climatological–hydrodynamic approach, which requires a large number of simulations on the computationally expensive numerical meshes, has mainly been applied at city or regional scales
