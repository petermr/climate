<p id="Par15">In all RCPs, suitable area is expected to increase by 2050. However, for RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, suitable area will decrease significantly by 2070. The most favorable scenarios for suitable habitat (RCPs 2.6 and 4.5) resulted in increases of 243% and 275%, respectively, in suitable habitat area by 2070, while the less favorable scenarios (RCPs 6.0 and 8.5) resulted in decreases of 40% and 39%, respectively, in suitable area by 2070 (Table

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Similarly, occurrence points located within suitable areas will be maintained through 2070 for RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 but will fall to 25.9% and 18.0% in RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Here, higher percentages indicate a lower range shift for the species, while lower percentages indicate a higher range shift.
