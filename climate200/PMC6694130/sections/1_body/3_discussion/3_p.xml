 </sup>). The predicted range of suitability resulting from Maxent modelling is an increase of 80% from the current IUCN range of 5,687 km
 <sup>2</sup> (or 1.8 times the IUCN range). This area contains 93.8% of the observed points, so it can be considered an improvement of the IUCN range, which only contains 51.4% of the observed points. Because some of the predicted areas are fragmented or too small, or because the species may not manage to disperse there, it is likely that the actual range will be smaller than the predicted 10,261 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Additionally, there are areas with medium to high suitability where the species has yet to be recorded.
