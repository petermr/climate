<p id="Par18">Despite this potentially larger new range, the threat status of 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> is still unresolved, as species with a limited range have often larger projected habitat loss and are more prone to extinction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>,

 </sup>, and a present point of concern in the Republic of Korea
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>
 </sup>. The results of Maxent modelling identify areas that are potentially important habitats for 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> and provide researchers with new potential survey locations. These results can inform future conservation efforts for the species in terms of protecting important habitat areas; the ranges calculated for habitat suitability fall within different threat levels of the IUCN red list of endangered species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>
 </sup>, and 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> would thus join the list of endangered species from the Korean Peninsula
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, acquiring the exact area of occupancy of the species would be important for ecological monitoring as 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> is likely to be sensitive to the newly emerged Chytrid fungus 
 <italic>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>
 </sup>. This fungus may soon be present in the Republic of Korea because of the pet trade, the same way it found its way to Europe
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>
 </sup>, and the same way the anuran Chytrid fungus entered Korea

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>
