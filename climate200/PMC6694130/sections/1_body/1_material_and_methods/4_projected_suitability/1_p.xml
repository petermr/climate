<p id="Par11">We predicted the potential future distribution of 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> using four climate change scenarios or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) based on atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> trajectories. These four RCPs correspond to increases of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 watts/m
 <sup>2</sup> by 2100, with wattage increasing with projected CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations (Table

 </sup>. SDMs were developed for two time-steps: 2050 (average for 2041–2060) and 2070 (average for 2061–2080) for all four RCPs. Among the global circulation models (GCMs) we used for all projections the Community Climate System Model 4.0 (CCSM4) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) at 30 arc seconds, or approximately 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> resolution, a choice confirmed by the jackknife analysis
