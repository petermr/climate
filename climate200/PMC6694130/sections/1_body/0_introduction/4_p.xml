<p id="Par5">Here we focus on the only plethodontid salamander in Asia, the Korean Crevice Salamander, 
 <italic>Karsenia koreana</italic>. It is considered one of the most elusive Korean amphibian species, and although it was first collected in 1971
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, it was only described in 2005
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Accordingly, very little is known about its morphology
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> and genetics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. In additions, 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> is not stringently bound to the aquatic environment as a result of the reacquisition of its larval stage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> and unusual breeding behaviour
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Little or no information is available about the potential range shift for 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> due to climate change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, but the latter is expected to have a negative impact on habitat suitability for plethodontids in general
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>
 </sup>. Climate change has likely caused body size reductions in other plethodontid salamander species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>
 </sup>, which affects fecundity (reviewed by Wells, 2007
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>) and rates of water loss
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. In turn this may impact surface activity time
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>, and consequently affect foraging, dispersal, reproduction, and might change future species’ distributions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>. As the climate on the Korean peninsula is getting warmer
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup> and dryer
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>, 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> is also going to be affected by climatic variations and related ecological changes. The aims of this study were (1) to define the potential current distribution of 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> through the development of a habitat suitability model and a set of bioclimatic and vegetation variables; (2) to investigate the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of 
 <italic>K. koreana</italic> in the Korean peninsula using four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are climate change scenarios based on greenhouse gas concentration trajectories.
