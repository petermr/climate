<p>Sample questions included one like, ‘please rate which of the following operations are influenced by too much rainfall’, with ploughing time, planting time, weeding, irrigation, fertiliser application, repening, burning, cutting and transport/haulage as options. The same closed responses were utilised for probing questions on ‘too little rainfall’, ‘too much heat’ and ‘too low heat’. Other questions asked for types of fertilisers used, time of the day at which irrigation took place and sources of climate change information with options for radio, extension officers, newspaper and ‘other’. Questions on adaptive capacity were further asked, such as, ‘which of the adjustments listed below did you do or plan to do to address impacts of climate change in order of importance?’ The responses were mainly closed-ended, and included change crop variety, change planting time, build a water reservoir, implement soil conservation techniques, get an insurance policy, increase irrigation, decrease irrigation, change irrigation system, change irrigations times, change from crop type and other. Some qualitative questions were also utilised to probe responses from key informants. One such question was ‘what are the major challenges experienced and potential areas of improvement in combating climate change in the Lowveld?’ Some of the responses that emerged included lack of information available on the subject, a call for more research and awareness raising, a need for more training and capacity building, and a call for improvement in climate adaptation modelling.</p>
