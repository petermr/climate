<p>Water resources in Swaziland are predicted to become increasingly limited because of climate change (World Bank

 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Soil and water conservation is considered beneficial because this has the potential to (1) improve soil fertility, (2) enhance soil water storage and (3) ensure crop buffer against droughts and floods (World Bank
