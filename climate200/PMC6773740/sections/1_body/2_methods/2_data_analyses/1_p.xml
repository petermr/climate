<p id="Par27">To allow direct comparison among study sites, the C storage per unit area (cumulative stocks, mass C m
 <sup>−2</sup>) was standardized to 1 m-thick deposits (i.e., length of the soil cores sampled). When necessary, we inferred C stocks below the limits of the reported data to 1 m, extrapolating linearly integrated values of C content (cumulative C stock per unit area) with depth. Correlation between extrapolated C stocks and measured C stocks in sediment cores ≥1 m was
