<p id="Par30">The upscaling of each habitat polygon was performed by multiplying the average ± SD soil C stocks, sequestration rates, and standing C stocks in the aboveground biomass for each ecosystem within each climate region by the specific ecosystem area to obtain blue carbon estimates at climate region scale (arid, semi-arid, temperate, subtropical and tropical, adapted from

 <italic>N</italic> = 52 for both tidal marshes and seagrasses) and on soil C sequestration rates for mangroves (
 <italic>N</italic> = 24) and seagrasses (
 <italic>N</italic> = 36) were limited, which resulted in data gaps within climate regions (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For example, estimates of biomass C stocks in tidal marsh are lacking for arid and tropical regions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In order to estimate C storage in VCE around Australia, C data from the nearest climate region was used when data was not available. The extents of each ecosystem considered to scale up Australia-wide estimates of C stocks and sequestration (based on climate regions) are presented in Table
