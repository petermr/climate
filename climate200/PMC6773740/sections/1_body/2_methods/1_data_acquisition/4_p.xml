<p id="Par25">Data on soil accumulation rates from 315 cores derived by means of 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb (last century) and/or radiocarbon (last millennia) was compiled. Concentration profiles of 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb along the upper part of the sediment cores were determined by alpha spectrometry through the measurement of 
 <sup>210</sup>Po using Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detectors (CANBERRA, Mod. PD-450.18 A.M) after acid digestion of the samples, assuming radioactive equilibrium between the 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>210</sup>Po radionuclides. After alpha spectrometry, selected samples from each core were analyzed for 
 <sup>226</sup>Ra by ultra-low background liquid scintillation counting (LSC, Quantulus 1220) or gamma spectrometry through the emission lines of its daughter radionuclides 
 <sup>214</sup>Pb and 
 <sup>214</sup>Bi (295.2, 351.9, and 609.3 KeV). The concentration profiles of excess 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb were determined by subtraction of 
 <sup>226</sup>Ra from total 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb concentrations along each core. Gamma spectrometry measurements were conducted in some cores using semi-planar intrinsic germanium high purity coaxial detectors with 40% efficiency, housed in a lead shield, coupled to a multichannel analyzer. 
 <sup>210</sup>Pb activity was determined by the direct measurement of 46.5 KeV gamma peak. Sediment accumulation rates were obtained by applying the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS
