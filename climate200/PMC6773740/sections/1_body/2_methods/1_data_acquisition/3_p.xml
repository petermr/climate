<p id="Par24">The organic C content of the soil organic matter was measured in milled subsamples from multiple slices along cores. The ‘Champagne test’ was used to determine whether soil samples contained inorganic carbon

 </sup>. The soil core sub-samples containing carbonates were acidified with 1 M HCl, centrifuged (3500 RPM; 5 min) and the supernatant with acid residues was removed using a pipette, then washed in deionized water, centrifuged again and the supernatant removed. These residual samples were re-dried (60–70 °C) before C elemental analyses. The method used to remove inorganic C prior to organic C analyses may lead to the loss of part of the organic C (soluble fraction), thereby potentially leading to an underestimation of sediment C content

 </sup>. Where carbonates were absent (all living plant samples and most tidal marsh and mangrove soil samples), bulk soil samples were milled and encapsulated without acid pre-treatment before C analyses. The C content was obtained using a dry combustion elemental analyzer or mass spectrometer. Percentage soil C on a mass basis was calculated for the bulk (pre-acidified) samples.
