<p id="Par22">Data on C stocks and sequestration rates in Australian tidal marshes, mangrove forests and seagrass meadows were compiled from published data. In addition, unpublished studies from the CSIRO Marine and Coastal Carbon Biogeochemistry Cluster project and other studies by the co-authors were included. The study sites included mono-specific and/or mixed tidal marsh, mangrove and seagrass ecosystems within a variety of depositional environments (from estuarine to exposed coastal areas, and supra-tidal to sub-tidal habitats) across five climate regions (arid, semi-arid, temperate, subtropical and tropical) in Australia. Data from 1553 study sites (593 from tidal marshes, 323 from mangrove forests and 637 from seagrass meadows) on soil C stocks (1103 cores in total), soil C sequestration rates (352 cores in total) and standing C stocks in aboveground biomass (141 measurements in total) were used in this study.</p>
