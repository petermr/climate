 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Seagrasses in arid regions also exhibit the highest soil C stocks per unit area among climate regions (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), while tropical seagrasses have the lowest soil C stocks (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, seagrass soil C sequestration rates are similar among climate regions (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), suggesting higher remineralization rates of soil C in tropical regions

 </sup>. The relatively low C stocks of tropical seagrasses may be due to the predominance of small, ephemeral and fast-growing species in the tropics (e.g., 
 <italic>Halophila</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Halodule</italic> spp.), which also support intensive grazing by sea turtles and dugongs, compared to the persistent meadows with large biomass found in arid and temperate regions (e.g., 
 <italic>Posidonia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Amphibolis</italic> spp.), where herbivory rates are much lower

 </sup>. Meadows formed by these larger temperate seagrass species contain relatively high amounts of degradation-resistant organic compounds in their tissues (e.g., lignin and cellulose) compared to small tropical seagrass species, which have readily decomposable tissues

 </sup>. In addition, the scarcity of riverine inputs in arid regions likely results in higher irradiance reaching the seafloor compared to other climate regions with higher run-off, thereby enhancing aboveground and belowground seagrass productivity
