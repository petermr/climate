 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For tidal marshes, the C stocks in aboveground biomass per unit area are up to 6-fold higher in in temperate regions compared to semi-arid and subtropical regions (

 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This likely reflects the influence of higher biomass species (e.g., 
 <italic>Juncus</italic> spp. rushes) in many temperate marshes, compared to the lower biomass species (e.g., 
 <italic>Sporobolus virginicus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sarcocornia quinqueflora</italic>) typically found in tropical, arid and subtropical climates. Variability in tidal marsh soil accretion rates and C stocks is often associated with differences in the position within the intertidal zone
