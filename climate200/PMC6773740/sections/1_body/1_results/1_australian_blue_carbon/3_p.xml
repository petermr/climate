<p id="Par8">Most tidal marsh and mangrove ecosystems in Australia occur in tropical regions (62% and 73%, respectively), while seagrasses are distributed across subtropical (38%), tropical (32%), and arid (16%) climate regions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Tidal marsh and mangrove soil C stocks and sequestration rates are 3-fold to 13-fold higher in tropical Australia than in other climate regions, mainly due to their extensive coverage over broad intertidal saltflats in tropical regions (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Similarly, mangrove soil C stocks and sequestration rates are up to 60-fold higher in tropical compared to other climate regions, owing to their larger extent in the tropics

 </sup>. Subtropical seagrasses within Australia hold 2-fold to 6-fold higher C stocks than seagrasses from other Australian climate regions. However, knowledge of Australian seagrass extent is incomplete due to challenges in mapping this ecosystem, as recently illustrated by the recent discovery of 35,000 km

 </sup>. Similarly, the spatial extent of tropical tidal marshes (including high intertidal saltflats) is likely large, but poorly mapped. Hence, the extent of seagrasses and tidal marshes may be significantly larger than currently estimated, so their blue carbon contribution estimated here is a conservative one.
