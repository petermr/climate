<p id="Par7">The extent, geographic distribution and type of VCE determine the distribution of C stocks and sequestration rates over the continent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Mangroves contain ~80% of total C in living aboveground biomass of Australian VCE, while seagrasses accounted for ~70% of total soil C stocks and sequestration rates. Most C stocks in seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems are found in their soils (98% and 99%, respectively), while C stocks in mangrove ecosystems are distributed in both soil (62%) and aboveground biomass (38%) pools (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Australian mangroves have up to 17-fold and 65-fold higher C stocks in aboveground biomass per unit area compared to tidal marshes and seagrasses, respectively (
