<p id="Par14">Soil C stocks in Australian terrestrial ecosystems have been estimated at 29.7 Mg C ha
 <sup>−1</sup> (in 30 cm-thick soils
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>), while Australian VCE contain on average ~4-fold higher C stocks (123 Mg C ha
 <sup>−1</sup> in 1 m-thick soils) than in terrestrial counterparts. Note that this estimate is conservative since terrestrial and VCE soil C stocks can reach thicknesses &gt;1 m and &gt;6 m depth, respectively

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, VCE can accrete vertically over millennia without becoming saturated in C, and soil C stocks are generally protected from fires. As a result, C turnover rates in VCE are an order of magnitude slower than most terrestrial soils

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Our estimate of the soil CO
 <sub>2</sub> sequestration capacity of Australian VCE (13–20 Tg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup>) is equivalent to ~4–6% of the CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil-fuel burning, cement production and gas flaring in Australia (361 Tg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup> at 2014 rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>). In addition, the CO
 <sub>2</sub> sequestration capacity of Australian VCE equates to 70–140% of CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions from land use change in Australia (estimated in 14.4–18.4 Tg CO
 <sub>2</sub>-e year
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>). Hence, VCE are a significant component of Australia’s C budget and provide effective opportunities for C sequestration and climate change mitigation strategies based on VCE conservation and restoration.
