<p id="Par20">Sustainable management of VCE requires an informed understanding of the ecological and economic significance of changes in natural resources due to threats such as human activities and climate change. Current assessments of CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions from VCE due to land use change in Australia have focused on emissions due to conversion of mangroves and tidal marshes to settlements (Tier 1 estimates), and have not accounted for emissions associated with losses of seagrass nor for conversion of mangrove and tidal marsh to pasture

The Australian Government established the International Partnership for Blue Carbon after the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change conference in Paris 2016. The Australian Government also commissioned a technical review of the inclusion of blue carbon projects in its domestic carbon abatement scheme (the Emissions Reduction Fund), through management of ecosystems towards the enhancement of C storage and/or avoided GHG emissions
