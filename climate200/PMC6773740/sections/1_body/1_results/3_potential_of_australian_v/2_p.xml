<p id="Par16">The potential of VCE conservation for climate change mitigation relies on the preservation of their millenary soil C stocks. Following disturbance or conversion of VCE, a portion of the soil C becomes exposed to oxic conditions and decays at a relatively fast rate (estimated at 0.183 year
 <sup>−1</sup>), resulting in the remineralization of 85% of the soil C stock exposed to oxic conditions within a decade

 </sup>. Since major historic losses of VCE extent in Australia occurred more than two decades ago, restoration of these areas may have little benefit in terms of avoided GHG emissions.
