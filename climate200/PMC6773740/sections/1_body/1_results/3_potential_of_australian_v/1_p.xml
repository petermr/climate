 <sup>2</sup> for seagrass
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup> (20–26% loss of original extent). In addition to the loss of important ecosystems services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries and biodiversity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>), losses of Australian VCE result in a loss of their CO
 <sub>2</sub> sequestration potential, remineralization of C stocks in aboveground biomass as CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and the risk that erosion and remineralization of soil C accumulated over millennia contributes to GHG emissions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Management activities, which fall outside business-as-usual scenarios, aiming to restore VCE can enhance soil C sequestration and/or avoid GHG emissions following disturbance, as demonstrated for Australian seagrass meadows

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, and thus have the potential to be eligible for C crediting under financial mechanisms. The Australian Government Emission Reduction Fund is a policy mechanism that attempts to promote GHG abatement through the conservation, restoration or creation of VCE
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. For example, restoring tidal flows to drained coastal areas has been identified as a feasible activity for restoring VCE
