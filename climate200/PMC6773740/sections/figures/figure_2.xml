  <p>Scaled up estimates of organic carbon (C) storage in vegetated coastal ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) across Australian climate regions. 
   <bold>a</bold> Soil C storage (Mg C ha
   <sup>−1</sup>) in the top meter. 
   <bold>b</bold> Living aboveground biomass C stock (Mg C ha
   <sup>−1</sup>). 
   <bold>c</bold> Soil C sequestration rates (Mg C ha
   <sup>−1</sup> year
