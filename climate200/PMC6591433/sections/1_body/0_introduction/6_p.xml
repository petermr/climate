<p>Influencing pro-environmental behavior is becoming particularly important as the impacts of climate change worsen (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wynveen and Sutton, 2017</xref>). Belief in, and knowledge of, climate change have been linked to the adoption of more strategic adaptations in some resource-dependent industries (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2013</xref>), and work inspired from Stern’s value-belief-norm (VBN) theory of environmentalism suggests that perceiving adverse effects from global warming could promote mitigation behaviors (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2015</xref>). However, a growing literature is suggesting that concern about the environment should not be the main message to communicate to people in order to influence their behavior, as it may not be a primary motivation for change (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cook and Ma, 2014</xref>). Researchers are suggesting that the key catalysts for change encompass factors such as social justice, community, frugality, personal integrity, health, and beliefs in self-efficacy (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin and Lammers, 2016</xref>). It appears that having a positive attitude is important, believing that the climate has been changing over the previous 30 years, and having a stronger belief in human activities influencing the climate (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tam and Chan, 2017</xref>). More recent thinking suggests that the decision to adopt appropriate pro-environmental behaviors will reflect some general psychological orientations, or values, that are culturally patterned (
