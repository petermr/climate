<p>In order to test our hypotheses, we fitted the value orientations and demographic factors (covariates) as fixed effects in multiple linear regression models in 
 <italic>R</italic> (one for each climate change response: reef grief, environmental behavior and climate change beliefs). The significances of individual terms were tested at Î± = 0.05. The variance inflation factor was systematically smaller than 5, indicating low level of collinearity among covariates. Assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals were checked by visual assessment of plots.
