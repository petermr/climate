<p>A single survey statement was used to assess each of (i) perceptions of environmental impact, (ii) perceptions of impact on self, and (iii) reef grief (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These questions are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Whilst we recognize that a single survey statement is unlikely to adequately represent the complexity of each of the concepts, we were practically limited, and suggest that any results are indicative of each concept only. Twelve survey questions were used to understand what values were important to people, and were categorized according to the ESVS. These survey questions are also presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Survey participants were asked to agree or disagree with each survey statement on a ten-point scale where a rating of 1 represented “very strongly disagree” and 10 represented, “very strongly agree.” A weighted mean was developed for each value category using a principal component analysis, where the survey responses were forced into the one factor score, after internal reliability was confirmed. Pro-environmental behaviors were measured by asking people to agree with each of four statements about environmental behavior. Given that all behaviors were correlated (Pearson correlations = 0.223
 <sup>∗∗</sup>, 0.288
 <sup>∗∗</sup>, and 0.398
 <sup>∗∗</sup>), we only used the following statement to represent all pro-environmental behaviors; “I make every effort to use energy efficiently in my home and workplace.” We also quantified age and gender. Global climate change beliefs were elicited through asking participants to describe which of the given statements best reflected their views on climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Given that global climate change beliefs were significantly correlated with local climate change beliefs (0.285
 <sup>∗∗</sup>), we only used local climate change beliefs in analyses.
