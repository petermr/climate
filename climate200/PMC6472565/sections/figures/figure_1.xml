  <p>Vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity that is low, relative to exposure and sensitivity, contributes to high vulnerability (top). By contrast, higher adaptive capacity helps reduce the effects of exposure and sensitivity, and in turn reduces vulnerability (bottom). (Reprinted with permission from Engle (
