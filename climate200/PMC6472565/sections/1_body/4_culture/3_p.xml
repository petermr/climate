<p>Yet “cultures” are not distinct entities, like planets or grapefruits. If cultures are systems of meaning, these are fuzzy rather than clearly bounded systems: evolving, transacted, and largely tacit (Winthrop,

Individuals participate in multiple cultural frames. Thus, the cultural understandings through which watermen on Chesapeake Bay, for example, whose livelihood depends on crabbing, view the threatened blue crabs both overlap with and diverge from the perspective of marine scientists who study the bay's ecosystem (Paolisso,
