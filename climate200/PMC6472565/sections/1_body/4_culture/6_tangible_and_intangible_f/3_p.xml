<p>Daily practices are critical to learning and transmitting cultural knowledge (Wagner, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0166" ref-type="ref">1981</xref>). In many societies, hunting, fishing, and gathering not only provide for material needs but also help maintain social groups and networks through acts of exchange. Such subsistence practices likewise preserve critical bodies of knowledge about plants' and animals' characteristics, mythic associations, and spiritual significance; and the attributes of the cultural landscapes where they are found (Winthrop, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0175" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). These bodies of knowledge are often locally specific. “The most important dimension of local knowledge may not even be specific information per se but particular strategies for learning about the natural world and applying the resulting insights—practices which may themselves differentiate indigenous from scientific knowledge” (Kirsch, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>, p. 173).
