<p>Culture—the shared and patterned meanings held by members of social groups—is vital to understanding climate change vulnerability. The human experience of nature and environmental change is mediated by culture. “Nature is seen by humans through a screen of beliefs, knowledge, and purposes, and it is in terms of their images of nature, rather than of the actual structure of nature, that they act” (Rappaport,

This applies with particular force to climate change adaptation and vulnerability, for in adaptation, “the identification of risks, decisions about responses, and means of implementation are all mediated by culture” (Adger, Barnett, Brown, Marshall, &amp; O'Brien,
