<p>Interventions can reduce harm and mortality that extreme weather events cause in socially vulnerable groups. Such interventions are far more effective when they account for the ways that this review's four themes—resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge—interact with the three components of vulnerability—exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Cases of maladaptation indicate that it is also necessary to account for potential unintended negative effects of adaptation interventions on people and places situated beyond the geographic and temporal scale of a given project. Attention to these issues will support the development of emergency responses and longer‐term adaptation strategies that minimize exposure and sensitivity, and that elevate adaptive capacity under a changing climate.</p>
