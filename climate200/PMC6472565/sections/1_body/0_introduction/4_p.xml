<p>Vulnerability, rather than an unchanging state, is a multidimensional process affected by social, political, and economic forces interacting from local to international scales (Bohle, Downing, &amp; Watts,

Recognizing that many factors influence vulnerability, we identify four broad themes as particularly helpful for understanding the social aspects of vulnerability and structure our review around these themes: resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge. We bring to our analysis multiple disciplinary perspectivesâ€”cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology. The four themes capture prominent theoretical framings found in each of these disciplines, but they do not map exclusively to any one discipline. Together they provide a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary social science framework for analyzing and understanding uneven vulnerability across social difference. Any effort to reduce uneven vulnerability requires understanding why it exists in the first place, a subject for which these disciplines, with their established approaches to examining issues of power and social difference, are especially well suited.
