<p>Populations are not uniformly vulnerable to climate change. The reasons for vulnerability are largely social and economic, not merely a matter of different exposure to climate‐related and environmental hazards. We have identified several factors responsible for differences in local‐scale vulnerability to climate change and suggested a number of actions to reduce it. Access to resources is one critical factor that shapes communities' ability to plan for and respond to the impacts of climate change. Addressing unequal access to resources involves a twofold challenge: it requires both action on a community or project basis, and larger‐scale structural change to reduce poverty and political marginalization. Climate change presents both acute and chronic challenges for effective governance. The successful examples of environmental governance discussed here demonstrate the benefits of partnerships among governments, social movements, and organizations. Cultural systems shape how people understand environmental change, while at a local or regional scale culture and history may constrain the feasible responses to climate change threats. Valid and timely information about weather and climate are necessary but not sufficient to promote effective action at a community scale. Putting into practice an iterative process in which researchers and community residents jointly shape the availability, dissemination, and use of knowledge increases the likelihood that the information will meaningfully contribute to adaptive responses to climate change.</p>
