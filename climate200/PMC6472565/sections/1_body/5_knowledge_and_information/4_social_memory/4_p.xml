<p>Intracommunity processes of knowledge production and dissemination may privilege certain types of knowledge, such as scientific knowledge, or official discourses may be imposed; both tendencies may reduce or prevent transmission of local, environmentally relevant knowledge (Gilmartin, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). Shortening the depth of social memory, perhaps to only a few decades, may reduce the capacity to identify local risks, and thereby increase vulnerability (Bone, Alessa, Altaweel, Kliskey, &amp; Lammers, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In Puerto Rico, local environmental knowledge about hurricanes or tsunamis has traditionally been sustained via oral transmission within families and other networks. However, local knowledge has been eroded by outmigration and the failure to record and preserve the older generation's memories (Duany, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Moreover, social memory plays a critical role in shaping local knowledge.
