<p>Humans must learn their environments: knowledge of environmental cycles and hazards is not innate (Rockman, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0141" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Such knowledge shapes the very concept of “hazard,” informs decision‐making, and supports the identification of risks. Environmental knowledge does not require first‐hand experience but its accumulation and usefulness do depend on effective social transmission (Crumley, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The effective response to the 2004 Asian tsunami on Simeulue Island, Indonesia drew on oral history of a 1907 earthquake and tsunami that killed as much as 70% of the island's population. Because most residents knew this history, in 2004 they headed to higher ground within minutes of the earthquake and so escaped the tsunami (McAdoo, Dengler, Eeri, Prasetya, &amp; Titov, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). This case demonstrates how a single event can generate a useful memory that outlasts a single lifetime and can help shape public response to hazards. When local environmental knowledge extends beyond direct, individual experience, communities may draw on this knowledge to identify potential risks and implement innovative local adaptation and mitigation strategies faster and more effectively than if they wait for larger, nonlocal institutions to act (Evans, Milfont, &amp; Lawrence,
