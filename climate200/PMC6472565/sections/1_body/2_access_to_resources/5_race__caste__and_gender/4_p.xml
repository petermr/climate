<p>Gender is a potent factor explaining vulnerability to climate‐related impacts. Factors such as lack of access to and control over basic resources and lack of entitlements amplify women's vulnerability and undermine their ability to cope with effects of disasters (Denton,

One study in coastal Bangladesh examined the immediate impacts of cyclone Aila in 2009, as well as more gradual and longer‐term changes, like working the fields in worsening heat, retrieving water from seawater‐contaminated wells, and repairing infrastructure damaged by recurrent tidal flooding (Al Nahian, Islam, &amp; Bala, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). These situations increased hardships in daily resource acquisition tasks for women, in turn driving increased hunger. They also found that due to restricted gender roles, women were unable to attend nongovernmental organization (NGO) trainings or income generating activities without their husbands' permission (Al Nahian et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Perhaps the most striking example of women's extreme vulnerability comes in cases where women are unable to evacuate from rising flood waters due to religious and cultural restrictions on their traveling without male chaperones (Crate &amp; Nuttall, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Sultana, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0158" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Addressing vulnerability therefore requires understanding of and attention to gender and its interactions with race and caste, but also class.
