<p>In the case of coastal impacts of climate change, such inequalities are increased financially through the unequal expenditure of adaptation funds, and physically through the construction of sea walls or other coastal protections that literally shift the problem down the road or across the river (Adger, Arnell, &amp; Tompkins, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). In many cases of coastal hazards, the construction of sea walls, dikes, flood channels, and other “gray infrastructure” may protect land and life for target populations while deflecting risk elsewhere (Atteridge &amp; Remling, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In Southeast Asia, flood risk management strategies heavily reliant on structural measures prioritize the protection of high‐value property and land uses that benefit local elites over the ecological services of productive fisheries, wetlands, and floodplains that primarily benefit rural farmer and fisher households (Lebel &amp; Sinh, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). A recent study in eight cities around the world found two main ways that efforts to reduce vulnerability could increase inequality (Anguelovski et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). First, “infrastructure investments, land use regulations, or new protected areas disproportionately affect or displace disadvantaged groups” (Anguelovski et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>, p. 334). A second set of impacts were from “plans that protect economically valuable areas over low‐income or minority neighborhoods, frame adaptation as a private responsibility rather than a public good, or fail to involve affected communities in the process” (
