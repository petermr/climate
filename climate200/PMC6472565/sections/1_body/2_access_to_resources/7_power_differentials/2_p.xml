<p>The ability to influence or coerce different groups—social power—is derived from and reproduces the social hierarchies that create inequalities in access to resources, which in turn engender differential vulnerability among communities. In this way, power differentials may be conceptualized as a synthesis of the other two sets of issues described above. Vulnerability occurs not only because of the marginalization or poverty of particular social groups but also through the processes that perpetuate or expand marginalization and poverty, potentially including adaptation planning (Anguelovski et al.,

It is possible to increase inequalities in adaptive capacity by enabling “powerful geographical groups of people to minimize negative environmental externalities and appropriate positive environmental externalities in particular places, with unjust socio‐environmental consequences” (Collins,
