<p>A third common example of the relationship between poverty and vulnerability draws attention to the built environment. The locations in which poor people reside are often less resistant to the impacts of weather and climate change. Cheaper, less‐desirable housing sites such as floodplains and unstable hillsides are often more exposed to climate hazards (e.g., Wisner, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0176" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Buildings may be poorly constructed, thereby increasing sensitivity to climate impacts (Austin &amp; Schill, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Bolin, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>; Greene, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>; Hallegatte,

 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0125" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). This renders poor people vulnerable to climate change in and of itself, but it also broadens their vulnerability because recovery becomes more difficult. For example, after Hurricane Andrew, although the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)—the primary disaster response agency in the United States—opened disaster‐assistance centers, poor victims were disproportionately impacted by the storm but received less relocation assistance because it was difficult to get transportation and childcare, and to take time off work to make claims (Dash, Peacock, &amp; Morrow, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). In recovering from climate‐related disasters, the biggest challenges the poor face are often to secure safe housing and to relocate (Fothergill &amp; Peek, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This reflects a lack of economic, institutional, and political capacity among poor households, which are all capacities tied to power.
