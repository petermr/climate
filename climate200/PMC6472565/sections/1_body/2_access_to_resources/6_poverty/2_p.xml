<p>Poor people and poor nations regularly suffer the greatest losses from climate‐related disasters (Roberts &amp; Parks, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0140" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Poverty affects access to resources, and in turn vulnerability, in several complicated ways (Blaikie, Cannon, Davis, &amp; Wisner, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>; Leichenko &amp; Silva, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Peacock, Morrow, &amp; Gladwin, 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). Vulnerability is determined by economic, institutional, and political capacities of different people affected by climate‐related impacts (Bohle et al., 
 <xref rid="wcc565-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). If access to resources is limited by income or wealth, vulnerability results from a lack of 
 <italic>economic capacity.</italic> If resources simply do not exist in a place inhabited by a certain group, vulnerability stems from a lack of 
 <italic>institutional capacity</italic> in that group. Finally, if access to resources is limited by processes of exploitation or surplus appropriation, vulnerability must be considered to result from a lack of 
 <italic>political capacity</italic> to obtain or retain resources. In each case, the marginalized group may be considered poor, but solutions to limit or reduce vulnerability may differ widely.
