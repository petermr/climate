<p>In addition to public and private institutions, civil society often comprises a third dimension of governance. Incorporating the efforts of diverse civil society groups, from sports clubs and churches to social service organizations and protest movements, can enhance communities' capacity to prepare for and respond to climate‚Äêrelated extreme events.
