<p>Climate change adaptation activities vary from locally autonomous endeavors to government‐led projects. Regarding flood risk management, in many peri‐urban communities, homeowner associations, and other local groups are responsible for maintaining storm‐water retention ponds and green infrastructure facilities that reduce flooding and protect local waterways. Associations often lack the funds and technical expertise for proper management of these features; such lack increases both vulnerability to water hazards and risks for downstream communities. Many groups, ranging from individual municipalities to complex social organizations comprised of neighbors along shorelines, have self‐organized to construct coastal defenses such as breakwaters, seawalls, and revetments. Regardless of the degree of self‐organization, financial and decision‐making capacity may limit community‐based project development (Allen,
