<p>The processes of governance—how societal problems are addressed by governments and other organizations—both shape and respond to climate change vulnerability. The concept of governance extends well beyond formal governmental institutions, encompassing “the relationships between government and society including the means through which private actors, markets, and interest‐based networks influence policy decisions” (Chaffin et al.,

Climate change presents both acute and chronic challenges for effective governance, requiring responses to both sudden “pulse” events such as Cyclone Nargis, which killed over 130,000 people in Myanmar, in 2008 and gradual “press” events such as sea‐level rise (Collins et al.,
