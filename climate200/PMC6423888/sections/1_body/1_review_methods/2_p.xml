<p id="Par16">In total, 820 titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer after removal of 34 duplicate items. To be included, articles had to describe adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible and no time limits were imposed. We excluded articles that were not in English (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), only covered animals or plants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 345), were not on South Africa (
 <italic>n</italic> = 273), were unrelated to health (
 <italic>n</italic> = 57) or to climate change (
 <italic>n</italic> = 56), or were only on climate change impact (
 <italic>n</italic> = 34) or mitigation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 31). In total, we screened 86 full text articles for eligibility, 21 of which were included (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also included literature located through searches of article references (one additional paper) or through targeted internet searches. Thereafter, we extracted data on the characteristics of the included articles, including their study design and outcome measures (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In analysis, we grouped studies on similar topics and, where possible, attempted to highlight commonalities or differences between the study findings. Policy documents were located by searching the website of the National Department of Environmental Affairs (
