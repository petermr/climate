<p>The combination of impacts on biodiversity is likely to be nonlinear rather than a simple superposition under different climate and land‐use scenarios. Effects may be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic when two variables work together. On one hand, future climate scenarios are filled with uncertainty globally. Carroll et al.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">75</xref> demonstrated that change in climatic velocities, which were derived from different general circulation models and emissions pathways, was less than the variation among other environmental diversity indicators. As information on the direction and speed of climate change becomes more reliable, it may be possible for planners to assess priorities on the basis of replaceable indicators that can be applied to a highly variable region. On the other hand, land use is driven by both natural (climate change, soil condition, vegetation succession, etc.) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., demographic change, poverty status, technological progress, and political and economic structure) with complex feedbacks. The relationship of driving forces is often quantified by the combination of conceptual models and mathematical model.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">76</xref> However, the main driving force remains uncertain due to the variability of regional characteristics.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> If the negative impacts of land‐use change cannot be addressed, then the options for dealing with climate change are greatly reduced. At a broad global scale, the socioeconomic system to meet increased human population size, growing food demands, and changes in urban planning policies is set to continue. In this regard, greater attention needs to be given to the interacting effects of other anthropogenic stressors such as movements of people, hunting, poaching, and illegal wildlife trading.
