<p>Crucially, the threats to biodiversity are stimulating scientists to make definitive predictions about the impacts of this process. Current estimates are diverse, depending on the modeling approaches, taxonomic groups, biodiversity loss metrics (e.g., species richness, vulnerability, or extinction rate), and spatial scales and time periods considered. Some models have considered just a single taxon or endangered rare species, but these results are not representative. Many focus on specific hotspots or on the local area of the researcher. It is crucial to begin developing spatially explicit global forecasts that go beyond the demographic dimension of the species concerned. Biodiversity is lost from fragmented habitats, but also exerts a far‐reaching influence on the larger landscape. It would be helpful to improve biodiversity monitoring by using available remote sensing (RS) applications that could be expanded into national indicators.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring biodiversity at low cost. Furthermore, solutions to biodiversity loss may come from some standardization of future research (e.g., of taxonomic groups, methods, time horizon, and scale). This might help decrease uncertainty at the expense of the breadth of knowledge and bring much required innovation to this field. A major near‐term target is to substantially improve understanding, predictive capacity, and reactive potential that will help researchers, policy makers, and conservation practitioners to better minimize risks and exploit opportunities provided by climate–land‐use change interactions.
