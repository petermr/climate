<p>These changes are important natural and anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem dynamics, and strongly modulate the structure and functioning of ecosystems.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Changing environment might thus considerably alter the ecosystems, with potentially far‚Äêreaching impacts on their biodiversity and capacity to provide ecosystem services to society. It is necessary to utilize their beneficial effects on biodiversity aiming to emulate changes in ecosystem management, instead of strict avoidance of changes due to negative effects on selected ecosystem services.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> When multiple targets need to be realized within a specific landscape, changes can be expected to have both positive and negative impacts on possible objectives of ecosystem management. In recent decades, not only global changes have increased recently, but also the range and demand for ecosystem services have been growing steadily. Therefore, how to balance these positive and negative impacts on in the particular context of changing environment will be a key challenge for future ecosystem management.
