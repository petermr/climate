<p>With the aim to provide ecosystem services to society while fostering biodiversity, ecosystem management requires a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate–land‐use change. Yet only a handful of studies address multiple interacting threats when prioritizing management actions for conservation, so the benefits of abating a single threat may be overestimated.

 </xref>), and attempted to describe their interactive effects on biodiversity‐related ecosystem services. Our overall objectives were to 1) elaborate ecological responses to future climate–land‐use change for selected indicators of ecosystem services and biodiversity; 2) discuss how climate change and LUCC interact to affect biodiversity‐related ecosystem services via a quantitative meta‐analysis; and 3) identify the current needs and the future priorities in ecosystem management.
