<p>Extreme climatic events, such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes, are projected to become more frequent and intense in the coming decades.

 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> For example, a changing climate may push a plant species closer to the edge of its fundamental niche space, reducing its competitive ability and allowing other plant species to become dominant, a process which is exacerbated under extreme weather conditions. Increasing incidence of extreme events may also lead to cold‐associated species being replaced by warm‐adapted species in some places. But most research on the effects of climate change has focused primarily on the consequences of increased average temperatures rather than on the impacts of extreme climatic events.
