<p>Climate change also affects land use through changes to socioeconomic regimes and adaptation policy. To a great extent, how society addresses climate change will affect biodiversity when mitigation policies reduce direct climate change impacts. Meanwhile, these policies will influence land‐use decisions which could have either positive or negative influences on habitat for a large number of species. The mismatch between climate change mitigation and conserving biodiversity is most apparent in the tropics. Sometimes, efforts to protect carbon‐storing trees to mitigate climate change may result in conserving only an empty forest.
