<p>Most obviously, climate change has the potential to affect the distribution and range of all species,
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> so many studies focus on current geographic distributions to inform predicted shifts under various climate change scenarios.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> However, a major source of uncertainty is the spatial mismatch between the range of species and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Species, and their genetic diversity, are able to adapt to climate change when the changing ecological conditions are suitable.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Climate‚Äêinduced range shifts of species have been confirmed along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients where dispersal mechanisms and resource availability allowed such shifts.

 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Even so, the shift has not been fast enough to keep pace with climate change for numerous species, especially plants whose capacity to move tend to be more conservative than the more mobile animals. Since species will vary in their capacity to move, the new communities being established in response to climate change are likely to be novel and dynamic until the climate returns to a sort of stability at some point in the future.

 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Subtle impacts on basic biological parameters of individual species may bring about great changes in community's composition and structure.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Variation in interaction outcomes often occurs along gradients like temperature, seasonality, and phenology for plants.
