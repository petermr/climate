 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> The positive correlation between biodiversity and ecosystem services is supported by a substantial literature.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Specially, from 2010 onward, the field of ecosystem services related to biodiversity has grown rapidly. Approximately 80% of studies were conducted in either North America or Europe, and the remaining 20% of studies occurred in Asia, Oceania, and Africa. The functional consequences of species loss may be mitigated or exacerbated by the simultaneous effect of species' richness and relative abundance.
 <xref rid="gch2201800095-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> For example, cold regions that become warmer and arid regions that receive increased precipitation are both likely to support a greater diversity of species. In most ecosystem processes, the influence of biodiversity is nonlinear, and change may accelerate as biodiversity loss increases.
