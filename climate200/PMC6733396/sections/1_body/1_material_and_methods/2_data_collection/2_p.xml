<p>In order to find the best available knowledge reported by the scientific community, we focused on peer‐reviewed academic literature from 2000 to October 2018. These publications were identified from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science using the following search terms: biodiversity or species richness or habitat quality or indices of diversity, ecosystem services or ecosystem function, land use, and climate change. Specially, reviews and syntheses were excluded in order to avoid double counting and the potential transfer of artifacts or errors from one review to the next. For each of these studies, we collected information on geographical location and spatial and temporal scales. To be specific, ecological effects were grouped into four different time horizons: short term (1–5 years), midterm (6–25 years), long term (26–100 years), and very long term (&gt;100 years); at the spatial scale, they were divided into four parts: patch (1–100 ha), landscape (101–100 000 ha), region (&gt;100 000 ha), and global (
