<p>We analyzed our literature‐derived database of climate–land‐use impact on biodiversity‐related ecosystem services in two steps. In the first step, we assessed ecological responses to climate change and LUCC with indicators of ecosystem services and biodiversity. In the second step, in order to understand the interactive effect, we conducted a meta‐analysis based on quantitative information on interaction mechanisms between climate change and LUCC.</p>
