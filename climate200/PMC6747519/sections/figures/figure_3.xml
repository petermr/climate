 <caption>
  <p>The response curves of eight environmental variables in camphor habitats distribution model. The logistic probability of presence is represented by the vertical axis and the climate variable by the horizontal axis. The values of probability presence range from 0 to 1, with values &gt;0.5 meaning a better than random fit. The red curves shown are the averages over 10 replicate runs; blue margins show Â±1 standard deviation (SD) calculated over 10 replicates.</p>
