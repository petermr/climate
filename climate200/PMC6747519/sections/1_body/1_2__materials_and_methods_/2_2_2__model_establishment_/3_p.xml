<p>In order to assist model validation and interpretation, it is usually necessary to set a decision threshold to distinguish the suitable and unsuitable regions. Threshold values could be set by many different approaches, in the cases of available absence data or presence only [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this study, we applied a fixed threshold of 10%. Then, we projected the suitability of camphor distribution under current and future climatic conditions through MaxEnt, ranging from 0 (lowest suitability) to 1 (highest suitability). Based on the references published [

 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we defined the estimated value of greater than 0.6 as a high-adapted region, 0.4–0.6 as a moderately-adapted region, 0.1–0.4 as a low-adapted region, and less than 0.1 as an unsuitable region. In terms of current and future climatic conditions under different emission scenarios and time periods, a suitable area map was generated for camphor.
