<p>Results showed that the test data omission rate was very close to the prediction omission rate, and the fitting effect was good (

The average test AUC value of repeated operation was 0.923, and the standard deviation (SD) was 0.010, which indicated that the model is highly reliable for the potential habitat of camphor tree and can effectively reflect the distribution in China in the present and future time. The jackknife test was used during the MaxEnt model building to test the predictive power of each climate variable. Among the eight environmental variables used for model development, MAT, DD &lt; 0, MAP, EXT and PAS performed well (AUC &gt; 0.8, arranged from large to small), while AHM, TD, and CMD contributed less (

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03185-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The contribution rate of DD &lt; 0 was higher, reaching 81.1%, followed by EXT (12.3%), and the contribution rate of residual variables was lower. According to the results of the jackknife test of variable importance, the environmental variable that decreased gain the most was EXT when it was omitted, which therefore appeared to have the most information that wasnâ€™t present in the other variables (
