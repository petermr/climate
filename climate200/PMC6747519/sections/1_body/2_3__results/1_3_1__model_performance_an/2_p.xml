<p>The response curve of habitat adaptability to environmental variables clarifies the quantitative relationship between the logistic probability and environmental variables. Moreover, we can deepen the understanding of the niche of this species by explaining the response of the eight variables to the adaptation, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03185-f003">Figure 3</xref>. According to the response curves, the average annual temperature for suitable growth of camphor tree is 16.5–29 °C, the annual precipitation is 1000–3600 mm, and the extreme high temperature of 30 years is 37–39 °C.
