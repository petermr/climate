<p>In this study, we established the niche model of camphor tree by using MaxEnt algorithm, and found that accumulated temperature played a key role in the growth process of this species. In addition, this process was more dependent on temperature than precipitation conditions. At present, the potential habitats of camphor tree are mainly distributed in the subtropical regions of southeastern China. With climate change, the area of suitable range will expand and the habitats will continue to move to the northwest. We propose to incorporate the niche model into the development and conservation strategy of the camphor tree, which can guide the plantation establishment and resources protection of this species. </p>
