<p>The model showed that under the background of climate change, the suitable range of camphor tree in China would gradually increase. Geographically, suitable areas would spread to the high latitudes in the northwest, while suitable areas in the lower latitudes of the southeast coast would decrease. These results were consistent with the speculation that the distribution of plants would move to high latitudes and high altitudes by global warming [

The expansion of potential suitable habitats will enhance competitiveness of camphor in ecological communities, which is a positive signal for afforestation and management. The concepts of entropy and mutual information index were developed by Shannon in the context of information theory [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. They have been widely studied and applied in the case of multivariate normal distribution. An alternative way to define these climate variables that asses camphor distribution is using mutual information index to reduce the dimension of a multivariate system [
