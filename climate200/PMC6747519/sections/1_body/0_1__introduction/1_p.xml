<p>Global climate is entering a stage of rapid change, which will bring enormous pressure on forest ecosystems during this century [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The consequent effects, such as temperature increase, precipitation variability and frequent droughts, are expected to have negative impacts on geographical distribution of trees and biodiversity of the plantations, and may lead to ecosystem change and species extinctions [

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many studies have reported that habitat suitability of trees is limited by global warming, such as

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, some reports predict that a moderate rise in temperature would be positive to the growth of tree species in temperate and some frigid regions [
