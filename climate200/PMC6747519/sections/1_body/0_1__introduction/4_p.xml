<p>In this study, the MaxEnt algorithm was used to model the response of camphor to climate change, which will provide a theoretical basis for making management decisions and planting planning. Specifically, we tried to answer three questions: (1) What are the key climatic factors that affect the algorithm distribution of camphor? (2) Which habitats are suitable for camphor growth under current climatic conditions? (3) How will the future climate affect the habitat suitability of camphor?</p>
