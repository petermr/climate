<p>In recent years, species distribution models have been widely used to assess the impacts of climate change on the distribution of species suitable areas [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These models can establish a connection between a speciesâ€™ geographical distribution and environmental variables through statistical response functions [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and then predict potential suitable areas and the future distribution of those species in the context of climate change over different times. While most species distribution models require collection of both presence and absence data of the geographical distribution, the Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) needs only presence data (including species presence and environmental variables) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. MaxEnt can create the distribution map and variable response curve by testing the reserved part of the training data [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-03185" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some studies have shown that MaxEnt possesses preeminent predictive power in simulation and evaluation, and has been widely used in the study of distribution of current and future suitable habitats [
