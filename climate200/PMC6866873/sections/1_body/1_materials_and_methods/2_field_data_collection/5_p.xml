<p id="p0075">Around the time of lambing, and on three further occasions in the next eight (Farm 1) and 11 (Farm 2) weeks, individual faecal samples were taken from ewes per rectum by the farmer. Not all ewes provided a sample on each occasion. On Farm 2, lambs were weighed at approximately 8 weeks of age as a measure of dam milk production, and ewes were weighed in late pregnancy and at the end of the study. Faecal samples were sent to the laboratory by post where they were stored at 8 °C, and FECs were conducted within 5 days using a modified McMaster method with a detection limit of 10 eggs per gram of faeces (epg). Trichostrongylid nematode eggs, 
 <italic>Nematodirus</italic> spp. eggs and coccidia oocysts were counted separately. Raw counts were used for statistical analysis and transformed to epg for data presentation. For each farm, the week of peak FEC was extracted for individual ewes with at least three FECs over the four sampling periods to estimate the timing and magnitude of the peak FEC during the PPR. For all other analyses, the complete dataset was used, except 11 ewes that were excluded from the dataset for Farm 2 as FECs were only available for the first sampling period. A further four ewes with a single FEC in either week 5 or 7 were also identified on Farm 2. However, these ewes were not excluded as these FECs fell within the plausible peak of the PPR.
