<p id="p0065">Ewes were selected for inclusion across a wide range of EBVs for FECs, with similar numbers of high (positive) and low (negative) scores. EBVs were estimated by Signet (

BLUP takes into account individual FECs, environmental effects such as management group, and pedigree (

EBVs for nematode FEC are inversely related to resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infection: low (negative) EBVs indicate higher levels of resistance, and high (positive) EBVs indicate lower levels of resistance. A total of 47 ewes were monitored on Farm 1, and 65 ewes on Farm 2.
