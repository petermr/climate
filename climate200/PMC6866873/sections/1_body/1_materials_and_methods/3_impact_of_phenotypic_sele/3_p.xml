<p id="p0085">Differences between the average FEC at each sampling point, and over the entire duration of the study, were compared between high (positive or zero) and low (negative) EBV groups using bootstrapping, following 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al. (2005)</xref>. Thus, individual FECs in each group were resampled with replacement, and sample size of the most numerous group truncated to match that of the smaller group, to compensate for overdispersion in FECs. On Farm 1, 18 ewes were in the high (positive or zero) EBV group and 29 in the low (negative) EBV group, and corresponding numbers on Farm 2 were 31 and 23. Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate 10,000 replicates, where individual bootstrapped counts in the low EBV group were subtracted from those in the high EBV group, and the mean difference calculated. The proportion of simulations where low EBV ewe counts were lower than high EBV ewe counts was then calculated from the 10,000 replicate simulations. A statistically significant difference in mean FEC was considered to be present where the difference between high and low EBV ewe counts was equal to or below zero in fewer than 5% of replicates, corresponding to the traditional
