<p id="p0135">Representative FEC profiles for 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> were defined using the high and low EBV ewe FECs observed in this study on Farm 2. 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> FECs are typically several-fold higher than 
 <italic>T. circumcincta,</italic> therefore the same FEC profiles used for 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> were adapted for 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> using a multiplication factor of 5. Linear interpolation was performed on the raw FEC data using the 
 <italic>approxfun</italic> function in R, to estimate daily group FEC values.
