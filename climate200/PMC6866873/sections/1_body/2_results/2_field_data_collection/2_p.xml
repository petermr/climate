<p id="p0150">An average of 3.5 faecal samples per ewe on Farm 1 (164 FECs on 47 ewes), and 2.6 on Farm 2 (166 FECs on 65 ewes) were analysed during the peri-parturient period. Individual ewe FEC and EBV data for both farms are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. On both farms, the average FEC increased after lambing, peaking at subsequent sampling occasions, before declining (
