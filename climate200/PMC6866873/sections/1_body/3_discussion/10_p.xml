<p id="p0240">Previous modelling studies have demonstrated the potential for carry-over of L3 pasture contamination from year to year, to magnify the benefits of breeding for resistance (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear, 1997</xref>). However, none have explored the potential for resistance to mitigate climate-driven increases in infection pressure. The simulations presented in this study, under the assumption of equal FEC input, no parasite adaptation to a changing climate (
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Rose Vineer et al., 2016</xref>), and the modest decrease in FECs observed in low EBV compared with high EBV ewes, predicted that pasture infectivity could be reduced to historic levels by introducing resistant ewes.
