<p id="p0215">The method of calculating EBVs based on FECs at 5–6 months of age was chosen by the participating farms as this supports current UK levy board breeding services recommendations for estimating FEC EBVs (Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board’s (AHDB) Signet Breeding Services:

However, evaluating individual ewes for resistance at 12 months of age or later may not be practical in many commercial sheep production systems where replacement ewes are chosen at a much earlier stage in their first grazing season, and multiple individual FECs are labour intensive and may not be perceived by farmers as economically viable, especially for larger flocks.
