<p id="p0270">The developmental success and survival of the free-living stages of 
 <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> and 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> are predicted to improve in many regions as a result of climate change, increasing infection pressure. Predicted pasture infectivity from resistant and susceptible ewes under historic and a future climate change scenario in a temperate region in Europe demonstrated the potential of selection for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes to mitigate the expected increase in challenge, and may offer a sustainable alternative or complement to chemical interventions.
