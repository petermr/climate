<p id="p0205">Resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes is largely a result of an acquired IgA-mediated regulation of worm fecundity after 3 months of age whereas variation in worm burden is not thought to be under genetic control in older lambs (

 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Stear et al., 1999</xref>). As lamb meat production is focused on maximising growth rates up to around 6 months of age, lambs bred from resistant ewes and rams will only benefit from any heritable resistance in their final few weeks of life. 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al. (1996)</xref> observed strong maternal effects, which decreased significantly in magnitude between 1 and 6 months of age, on the FECs of Scottish Blackface lambs. The role of maternal effects and the resistance of the ewe are therefore important in reducing exposure to infection in the first few months of a lamb’s life (
