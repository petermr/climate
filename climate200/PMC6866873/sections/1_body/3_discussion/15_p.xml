<p id="p0265">Benefits from selective breeding for nematode resistance may be realised in the maternal line through reduced egg output during the PPR, with positive epidemiological consequences on infection pressure in lambs, and without negative consequences for other aspects of performance. Measuring FECs at approximately 5–6 months of age for EBVs, as recommended by some breeding services, was observed to be an appropriate phenotypic parameter to select for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes in maternal lines. Measuring FECs approximately 5 weeks after lambing appears to be an effective way of comparing egg output during the PPR in ewes.</p>
