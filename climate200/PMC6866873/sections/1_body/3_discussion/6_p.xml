<p id="p0220">Simulations tracking the development, survival and migration of L3 from eggs deposited on pasture showed that the reduction in egg output of low EBV (resistant) ewes compared with high EBV (susceptible) ewes translated into a similar reduction in exposure of lambs to L3. The small variation observed is due to interactions between egg deposition and weather conditions, which determine the development success of eggs on pasture. The predicted reduction in pasture contamination on fields grazed by “resistant” ewes is supported by the observation of

 <italic>Trichostrongylus colubriformis</italic> infective larvae on pasture grazed by susceptible (control) Romney ewes during the peri-parturient period were over four times higher than on pasture grazed by resistant Romney ewes. Subsequent infection of lambs amplifies nematode populations on pasture, and survival of infective larvae over winter carries infection over to the next grazing season, magnifying onward epidemiological impacts of selective breeding on egg output during the PPR (
