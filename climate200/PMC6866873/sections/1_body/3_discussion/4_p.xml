<p id="p0210">Although the correlation between EBV and FEC was weak on Farm 2 and non-significant on Farm 1, discretizing the data into low (negative values) and high (positive values) EBV ewes revealed that a low EBV was associated with reduced egg output during the peri-parturient period. Peak egg output was reduced by 30–37% in low compared with high EBV ewes, and overall egg output during the peri-parturient period was reduced by 23–34%. EBVs evaluated at 5–6 months of age may therefore be an appropriate phenotypic parameter to select for resistance to nematodes in maternal lines.</p>
