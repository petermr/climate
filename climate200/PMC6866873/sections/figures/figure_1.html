 <caption> Conceptual diagram of model simulations estimating the exposure of lambs on two farms in southwestern England to Teladorsagia circumcincta or Haemonchus contortus infective larvae (L3) contributed by ewes during the peri-parturient period. The GLOWORM-FL model of the free-living stages of gastrointestinal nematodes ( Rose et al., 2015b) requires daily faecal egg counts as input (e.g. the observed faecal egg counts of ewes during the peri-parturient period from the two farms in 2014, B) as well as daily temperature and rainfall data (not shown). The eggs (E) develop (δ) through the pre-infective first and second larval stages (L) to infective larvae in the faeces (L3f). The L3 then migrate out (m 1) onto pasture (L3p) where they migrate vertically (m 2) between the soil (L3s) and herbage (L3h). All free-living stages die at stage-specific rates (μ i). All parameters are dependent on temperature and/or rainfall as described by Rose et al. (2015b). The model provides the daily number of eggs, larvae in faeces, and infective larvae on pasture as output, with the number of infective larvae on pasture further subdivided to give the numbers on herbage and in soil. These outputs can be used directly or subjected to further analysis. For example, the number of L3 on herbage per hectare estimated by the model can then be multiplied by the daily lamb herbage intake (A) to estimate the daily L3 intake, which is a direct estimate of exposure of lambs to infection arising from eggs excreted by ewes.
