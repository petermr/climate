Selecting for genetic resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infection could reduce reliance on chemical intervention and mitigate increases in parasite challenge due to climate change. Ewes of the composite Exlana breed with a range of estimated breeding values (EBVs) based on nematode faecal egg counts (FECs) were monitored during the peri-parturient period on two farms in southwestern England. Ewes with low EBVs (&#x0201c;resistant&#x0201d;) had lower FECs during the peri-parturient period than those with high EBVs (&#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d;): the mean FEC was reduced by 23% and 34% on Farms 1 and 2, respectively, while the peak FEC was reduced by 30% and 37%, respectively. Neither EBV nor FEC were correlated with key performance indicators (estimated milk yield, measured indirectly using 8&#x0202f;week lamb weight, and ewe weight loss during lactation). Simulations predict that the reduced FECs of resistant ewes would result in a comparable reduction in infection pressure (arising from eggs shed by ewes) for their lambs. Furthermore, although the reduced FECs observed were modest, simulations predicted that selecting for nematode resistance in ewes could largely offset predicted future climate-driven increases in pasture infectivity arising from eggs contributed by these ewes. Selective breeding of the maternal line for nematode resistance therefore has potential epidemiological benefits by reducing pasture infectivity early in the grazing season and alleviating the need for anthelmintic treatment of ewes during the peri-parturient period, thus reducing selection pressure for anthelmintic resistance. These benefits are magnified under predicted future climate change. The maternal line warrants more attention in selective breeding programmes for nematode resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Faecal egg count (FEC)</kwd><kwd>Resistance</kwd><kwd>Gastrointestinal nematodes</kwd><kwd>Peri-parturient rise (PPR)</kwd><kwd>Estimated breeding values (EBVs)</kwd><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Breeding</kwd><kwd>Parasite</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">Livestock producers have faced new challenges in parasitic disease control in recent decades due to climate-driven changes in the epidemiology of parasites, including the gastrointestinal nematodes that cause ovine parasitic gastroenteritis (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Gethings et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, anthelmintic resistance is widespread (<xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan and Vidyashankar, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2015a</xref>) and threatens the resilience and sustainability of small ruminant production enterprises (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Coles et al., 2006</xref>). As a result, sheep producers worldwide are looking to alternative methods of nematode control (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Charlier et al., 2018</xref>) such as bioactive forages (e.g. <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000fc;scher et al., 2014</xref>), vaccination (e.g. <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Nisbet et al., 2016</xref>) and breeding for resistance to endemic nematode species (e.g. <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear, 1997</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The observed impact of selecting individuals with low faecal egg counts (FECs) on gastrointestinal nematode epidemiology, for example to reduce infection pressure in subsequent years (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Gruner et al., 2002</xref>), the relatively high heritability of FECs (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Stear et al., 1997</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear, 2001</xref>), and the genetic correlation between low FECs and productivity traits such as growth rate (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Stear et al., 1997</xref>) are encouraging. However, breeding for nematode resistance has so far focused largely on the male line, since selection of rams with low FECs allows genetic improvements to be passed on to a large number of offspring.</p><p id="p0040">Ewes are known to increase nematode egg shedding in faeces during the peri-parturient period, around the time of lambing. This peri-parturient rise (PPR) in FECs provides an important source of eggs to contaminate pastures and increase subsequent infection pressure for lambs. Many farms treat ewes around the time of lambing to minimise contamination of lambing paddocks. Due to the contribution of the eggs produced during the PPR to the nematode population infecting lambs each grazing season, however, there are concerns that this strategy may select heavily for drug-resistant nematodes (<xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Leathwick et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, sub-therapeutic doses of anthelmintics may be transferred to the lamb via the ewe&#x02019;s milk, further selecting for resistance (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Leathwick et al., 2015</xref>). Selective breeding of ewes for attenuated PPR could reduce the need to treat ewes and lambs, and play an important role in slowing the development of anthelmintic resistance. These benefits are unlikely to be realised by focusing uniquely on terminal sire breeds in cross-bred meat lamb production systems, since it is the maternal line that generates early season pasture contamination.</p><p id="p0045">Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) are used by commercial breeders to select for desirable traits as they take into account the effects of genotype and environment on the observed phenotype (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Mrode and Thompson, 2005</xref>). Hence, this approach offers a practical method for genetic improvement within breeds where the breeding population available for selection is maintained across multiple management groups and farms (i.e. environments). For gastrointestinal nematode infection, EBVs are evaluated using FECs from lambs &#x0003e;18&#x0202f;weeks of age, although an IgA saliva test is under development (<xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2012</xref>). The value of EBV assigned to ewe lambs is unknown in terms of reducing future PPR. In addition, it is unclear whether enhanced immunity to nematodes following lambing could carry costs in terms of milk output or ewe weight loss. This is a risk since the energy and protein costs of immunity may trade off against those of growth and reproduction (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kidane et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Rauw, 2012</xref>). Selecting for resistance to nematodes might also trade off against an ability to resist other parasites and pathogens (<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Ezenwa et al., 2010</xref>). Improved understanding of the relationship between EBV for nematode FEC and the PPR could help to define targets for selective breeding, and quantify the expected epidemiological benefits of selective breeding strategies through reduced early season pasture contamination.</p><p id="p0050">A potential limitation to the strategy of breed improvement for parasite resistance is that it takes many years to attain goals, yet is necessarily tied to performance under current environmental and management conditions. Where the epidemiological situation is changing, as for gastrointestinal nematodes under climate warming (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Morgan and Wall, 2009</xref>), current breeding efforts might not be well matched to future conditions. Epidemiological models developed for gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep predict changes in both the magnitude and seasonal patterns of challenge as a function of temperature and rainfall (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>). Predictive models could be used to determine likely future changes in the epidemiological context of selective breeding programmes, to help inform selection goals.</p><p id="p0055">In this paper we aim to determine whether selection of ewe lambs for reduced FEC leads, in later life, to lower egg output during the PPR. Further, we explore the benefit of reduced PPR in terms of lower gastrointestinal nematode infection pressure for lambs under current and future climate scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Field data collection</title><p id="p0060">Exlana ewes on two separate farms in southwestern England (referred to as Farm 1 and Farm 2) were monitored in the spring of 2014 as part of an ongoing commercial breed improvement programme (Sheep Improved Genetics Ltd &#x02013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sig.uk.com/" id="ir005">http://www.sig.uk.com/</ext-link>). The Exlana is a composite hair breed sheep based on more than 14 breeds selected for their favourable or low input features, such as the Wiltshire Horn, Barbados Blackbelly and Lleyn. The dominant gastrointestinal nematode species in this region is <italic>Teladorsagia circumcincta</italic>. <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> infection was not observed or suspected on these farms.</p><p id="p0065">Ewes were selected for inclusion across a wide range of EBVs for FECs, with similar numbers of high (positive) and low (negative) scores. EBVs were estimated by Signet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.signetfbc.co.uk/" id="ir010">http://www.signetfbc.co.uk/</ext-link>) using the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) method on FECs taken when the ewes were 5&#x02013;6&#x0202f;months old. BLUP takes into account individual FECs, environmental effects such as management group, and pedigree (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Mrode and Thompson, 2005</xref>). EBVs for nematode FEC are inversely related to resistance to gastrointestinal nematode infection: low (negative) EBVs indicate higher levels of resistance, and high (positive) EBVs indicate lower levels of resistance. A total of 47 ewes were monitored on Farm 1, and 65 ewes on Farm 2.</p><p id="p0070">All ewes lambed over a 10-day period in mid-March, and within each farm were managed together for the duration of the study. On Farm 2, monitored ewes were all of similar age (2 or 3&#x0202f;years), and gave birth to twins (with the exception of one triplet-bearing ewe). This restriction was intended to reduce variation in FEC due to, inter alia, unequal resource allocation trade-offs among ewes feeding different numbers of lambs, which could modify the expression of immunity and hence FEC during the PPR (<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999</xref>). Equivalent restriction was not possible on Farm 1 due to limited numbers of ewes.

Not all ewes provided a sample on each occasion. On Farm 2, lambs were weighed at approximately 8&#x0202f;weeks of age as a measure of dam milk production, and ewes were weighed in late pregnancy and at the end of the study. Faecal samples were sent to the laboratory by post where they were stored at 8&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C, and FECs were conducted within 5&#x0202f;days using a modified McMaster method with a detection limit of 10 eggs per gram of faeces (epg). Trichostrongylid nematode eggs, <italic>Nematodirus</italic> spp. eggs and coccidia oocysts were counted separately. Raw counts were used for statistical analysis and transformed to epg for data presentation. For each farm, the week of peak FEC was extracted for individual ewes with at least three FECs over the four sampling periods to estimate the timing and magnitude of the peak FEC during the PPR. For all other analyses, the complete dataset was used, except 11 ewes that were excluded from the dataset for Farm 2 as FECs were only available for the first sampling period. A further four ewes with a single FEC in either week 5 or 7 were also identified on Farm 2. However, these ewes were not excluded as these FECs fell within the plausible peak of the PPR.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Impact of phenotypic selection for resistance on the observed PPR</title><p id="p0080">The relationship between the FEC-EBV estimated at 5&#x02013;6&#x0202f;months of age and observed FEC in individual ewes around lambing was assessed by a Spearman rank correlation, using the peak FEC per ewe, and average FEC per ewe over all sampling occasions. One-way Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to these mean and peak FECs for ewes in low and high EBV groups to determine whether these observed FECs were drawn from the same distribution.</p><p id="p0085">Differences between the average FEC at each sampling point, and over the entire duration of the study, were compared between high (positive or zero) and low (negative) EBV groups using bootstrapping, following <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et al.

The GLOWORM-FL model of the free-living stages of gastrointestinal nematodes (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2015b</xref>) requires daily faecal egg counts as input (e.g. the observed faecal egg counts of ewes during the peri-parturient period from the two farms in 2014, B) as well as daily temperature and rainfall data (not shown). The eggs (E) develop (&#x003b4;) through the pre-infective first and second larval stages (L) to infective larvae in the faeces (L3f). The L3 then migrate out (m<sub>1</sub>) onto pasture (L3p) where they migrate vertically (m<sub>2</sub>) between the soil (L3s) and herbage (L3h). All free-living stages die at stage-specific rates (&#x003bc;<sub>i</sub>). All parameters are dependent on temperature and/or rainfall as described by <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al. (2015b)</xref>. The model provides the daily number of eggs, larvae in faeces, and infective larvae on pasture as output, with the number of infective larvae on pasture further subdivided to give the numbers on herbage and in soil. These outputs can be used directly or subjected to further analysis. For example, the number of L3 on herbage per hectare estimated by the model can then be multiplied by the daily lamb herbage intake (A) to estimate the daily L3 intake, which is a direct estimate of exposure of lambs to infection arising from eggs excreted by ewes.

For example, a 4&#x0202f;year study of set-stocked groups of &#x02018;resistant&#x02019; and &#x02018;susceptible&#x02019; rams demonstrated that pasture contamination was significantly reduced, as confirmed using tracer lambs, and that worm burden was reduced by 99% in the &#x02018;resistant&#x02019; group compared with the &#x02018;susceptible&#x02019; group (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Gruner et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="p0230">Mounting an immune response is energetically expensive (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Rauw, 2012</xref>) and the potential for unfavourable trade-offs between resources allocated to resistance to parasites and pathogens and other desirable traits should be considered in any breeding programme. In the present study, the reduced FEC in low EBV ewes was not associated with any sacrifice in production in terms of lamb growth or ewe weight loss. However, the sample size was relatively small compared with other studies that have reported such an association. For example, using a dataset of over 1400 FECs from more than 400 ewes, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear (2001)</xref> observed a positive genetic correlation of 0.24 between Scottish Blackface ewe FECs and 4&#x0202f;week weights of lambs, which may indicate a trade-off between milk production and resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes.</p><p id="p0235">In this study, the high and low EBV ewes and their lambs were grazed on the same paddocks on both farms and shared a common environment. Therefore, the overall exposure to infection was similar for all lambs and the lambs born to high EBV ewes benefitted from the reduced FEC of co-grazing low EBV ewes. Given the negative association between worm burden and daily live weight gain (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Mavrot et al., 2015</xref>), selecting for low EBV ewes to improve resistance across the entire flock could theoretically result in 8&#x0202f;week weights greater than observed in this study, as exposure to infective larvae would be reduced, in line with the model predictions presented here.</p><p id="p0240">Previous modelling studies have demonstrated the potential for carry-over of L3 pasture contamination from year to year, to magnify the benefits of breeding for resistance (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Bishop and Stear, 1997</xref>). However, none have explored the potential for resistance to mitigate climate-driven increases in infection pressure. The simulations presented in this study, under the assumption of equal FEC input, no parasite adaptation to a changing climate (<xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Rose Vineer et al., 2016</xref>), and the modest decrease in FECs observed in low EBV compared with high EBV ewes, predicted that pasture infectivity could be reduced to historic levels by introducing resistant ewes.</p><p id="p0245">Breeding for resistance shows considerable potential to mitigate the impact of climate change and offers a sustainable alternative to chemical interventions. Furthermore, the predicted benefit of breeding for nematode resistance in the maternal line is relevant to other novel approaches to gastrointestinal nematode control that achieve similar reductions in FECs. For example, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Nisbet et al. (2016)</xref> achieved a 45% decrease in egg output during the peri-parturient period in ewes vaccinated against <italic>T. circumcincta</italic>. Notably, the observed decrease in egg output achieved by vaccination is greater than the average decrease achieved in the present study through selective breeding. Despite the relatively smaller reduction in FECs in the present study, the predicted benefits of this reduction in the context of reduced pasture contamination and reduced lamb exposure to infection lend support to the future role of vaccination in controlling gastrointestinal nematodes. Selective breeding might also enhance vaccine effectiveness in the field, as indicated by breed differences in responsiveness to a <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> vaccine (<xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0250">The simulations presented here considered only the impact of climate on the free-living component of the nematode life cycle as this is now well-characterised (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2015b</xref>) while there remains considerable uncertainty in the host&#x02019;s response to infection (<xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Saccareau et al., 2017</xref>), and in the drivers of hypobiosis (e.g. <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Capitini et al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Troell et al., 2006</xref>). Future insights into these processes could be incorporated into the model used here to assess their likely impact on predictions under current and future climates.</p><p id="p0255">Pasture infectivity is highly variable from year to year due to the impact of variable weather conditions on the survival and development of the free-living stages (<xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2015b</xref>). It is therefore recommended that field trials evaluating novel approaches to gastrointestinal nematode control are designed with this uncertainty in mind and that longitudinal, multi-year trials are attempted where possible. The model presented here can help to design efficient field trials, by exploring different scenarios in more detail and selecting key areas for empirical confirmation.</p><p id="p0260">In this study, similar qualitative patterns were observed on both farms, although differences in FECs between high and low EBV ewes at times of peak egg output on Farm 1 were more elusive. There was a statistically significant difference between the distributions of low and high EBV ewe mean FECs and maximum FECs on Farm 2, but not Farm 1. Similarly, the <italic>P</italic> values estimated by Monte Carlo simulation tended to be higher than the traditional acceptance threshold of 0.05 on Farm 1. This is reflected in the overlapping distributions of FECs in high and low EBV ewes. This is, to an extent, expected given the tendency for negative binomial parasite distributions within host populations. However, this could also be due to the lower sample size, narrower range of EBVs, and especially the looser inclusion criteria for the observed group on Farm 1, with ewes not managed in groups of similar age or number of lambs born, due to limited availability of ewes. Higher variability between ewes in factors affecting FECs during the PPR, such as individual fitness, nutrition or infection rate, or the resource demands of variable numbers of lambs, is likely to decrease the power of statistical comparisons between groups, and confound results. It is recommended that future studies, as far as possible, match ewes on potentially important criteria such as number of lambs, in order to increase study power. Effects of genetic resistance to nematode infection act through enhanced acquired natural immunity, and are likely to be most evident in relation to less resistant animals when infection pressure and nutritional stress are both high (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kidane et al., 2010</xref>), and therefore magnified in ewes feeding higher numbers of lambs. Therefore, twin-bearing ewes on a moderate plane of nutrition are probably the most suitable for studies on the effect of genotype on the PPR.</p><p id="p0265">Benefits from selective breeding for nematode resistance may be realised in the maternal line through reduced egg output during the PPR, with positive epidemiological consequences on infection pressure in lambs, and without negative consequences for other aspects of performance. Measuring FECs at approximately 5&#x02013;6&#x0202f;months of age for EBVs, as recommended by some breeding services, was observed to be an appropriate phenotypic parameter to select for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes in maternal lines. Measuring FECs approximately 5&#x0202f;weeks after lambing appears to be an effective way of comparing egg output during the PPR in ewes.</p><p id="p0270">The developmental success and survival of the free-living stages of <italic>T. circumcincta</italic> and <italic>H. contortus</italic> are predicted to improve in many regions as a result of climate change, increasing infection pressure. Predicted pasture infectivity from resistant and susceptible ewes under historic and a future climate change scenario in a temperate region in Europe demonstrated the potential of selection for resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes to mitigate the expected increase in challenge, and may offer a sustainable alternative or complement to chemical interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bairden</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>McKellar</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stear</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Genetic parameters for faecal egg count following mixed, natural, predominantly <italic>Ostertagia circumcincta</italic> infection and relationships with live weight in young lambs</article-title><source>Animal Sci.</source><volume>63</volume><year>1996</year><fpage>423</fpage><lpage>428</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stear</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modelling responses to selection for resistance to gastro-intestinal parasites in sheep</article-title><source>Animal Sci.</source><volume>64</volume><year>1997</year><fpage>469</fpage><lpage>478</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bishop</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Stear</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inheritance of faecal egg counts during early lactation in Scottish Blackface ewes facing mixed, natural nematode infections</article-title><source>Animal Sci.</source><volume>73</volume><year>2001</year><fpage>389</fpage><lpage>395</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0020"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Capitini</surname><given-names>L.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>McClure</surname><given-names>K.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Herd</surname><given-names>R.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of environmental stimuli on pre-infective and infective stages of <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> in the Northern United States for the induction of hypobiosis</article-title><source>Vet.
