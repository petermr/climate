<p>The impact of potential changes in temperature and clogging of joints on SSSG bridges in the U.S. is quantified, for the first time, by means of evaluating the interaction equation value for the main load carrying girders. In this study, we considered four different seasonal scenarios for bridge construction temperature, and three climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5) for projected temperatures for the years 2040, 2060, 2080 and 2100. Regardless the climate scenarios, the results of the analysis indicated that bridges located in the northern portion of the United States, such as Northern Rockies &amp; Plains, Northwest and Upper Midwest are the most vulnerable due to the more pronounced increase in temperature ranges (difference between future and construction temperatures), although, the interaction equation value also depends on other parameters such as the length, geometry and materials properties of the bridge. Moreover, a state-level analysis, shows that South Dakota and North Dakota are the critical states (highest interaction equation values), regardless of the climate scenarios. In contrast, the less susceptible regions are the Southeast and Northeast. In addition, the analysis of the progressive increase in temperature along future years revealed that for each 1°C increment in temperature range (ΔT), the interaction equation value (IEV) increases approximately 2%, implying continuous reduction in bridge capacity as the climate warms if no intervention is conducted.</p>
