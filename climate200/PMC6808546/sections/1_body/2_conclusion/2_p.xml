<p>Neglecting possible future climate change can jeopardize the integrity of many U.S. bridges. Efficient maintenance to keep the expansion joints functional, on regular basis, is vital to avoid undesirable thermal demands that will potentially be magnified due to climate change. Nevertheless, given the vast number of deck joints bridges throughout the U.S., the challenge in maintaining the bridges cannot be overlooked. The presented analysis offers an overview from the current to expected future conditions of SSSG bridges. The aim is to rank the most critical bridges to be repaired amid an extensive inventory with approximately 89,000 structures. Such an approach can also offer subsidy for decision makers to prioritize the allocation of funds for structure maintenance and replacement. Further research is necessary to better establish a relationship between the interaction equation value and the level and characteristics of subsequent structural damage, which is critical for determining bridge functionality. This could be realized by first realizing the most critical bridges, then develop detailed computer models that can shed more light on local structural behavior in addition to global performance. Moreover, analysis should be conducted to quantify the expected life-cycle cost while accounting for social and economic losses associated with downtime corresponding to inspection, maintenance, repair, and failure. Such holistic analysis should account for uncertainties associated with all possible and relevant random variables including those associated with climate models.</p>
