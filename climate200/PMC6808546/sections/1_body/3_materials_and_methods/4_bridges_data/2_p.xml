<p>The data for structural analysis was mainly obtained from the NBI; however, additional geometric information was estimated using the relationships given in [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223307.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). In addition, this study the superstructure of the bridges is comprised of steel-concrete composite I-girders due to their common use. The use of composite section in bridge construction began in the early 1930â€™s [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g009">Fig 9(A)</xref> illustrates a typical steel-concrete composite section while 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g009">Fig 9(B) and 9(C)</xref> illustrates the difference in the behavior of a non-composite and a composite steel-concrete section, respectively. In the latter, there is no relative slip between the concrete slab and steel I-girder and consequently the entire cross section deflects as a single unit.
