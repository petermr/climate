<p>The temperature of each bridge construction at the stage in which the expansion joints were installed is estimated based on the year of bridge construction completion and the geographical position provided by NBI. First, we consider four possible scenarios for the construction of all bridges in the U.S.—construction during winter (Scenario 1), spring (Scenario 2), summer (Scenario 3) and fall (Scenario 4); thus, each bridge is assessed under all of these four possible scenarios. Each scenario can be interpreted as a hypothetical temperature condition, where Scenario 1 (winter) is the worst case–the range from low temperatures that occurs in the winter until projected daily maximum temperatures for future years provides the greatest amplitudes, Scenario 3 (summer) is the most optimistic–since this is the warmest season, the variation until the projected daily maximum temperatures for future years presents the smallest amplitudes, and Scenarios 2 and 4 have intermediate ranges of temperature. The State Code of each bridge, available in the NBI, is used to tie each bridge to one of the nine U.S. climate regions: Northwest, Northern Plains and Rockies, Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, Northeast, West, Southwest, South, and Southeast. The temperatures for each bridge are then assigned for each scenario (for the respective year of construction conclusion) and are taken as the average of minimum temperatures for each season using the NOAA database of historical temperatures along the nine abovementioned U.S. climate regions [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223307.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The option for taking the average of minimum temperatures (instead the average) is because it provides a larger temperature range to calculate the maximum thermal stress imposed on the structures. Bridges built prior to 1895 were not analyzed since temperature data for this period is not available.
