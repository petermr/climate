<p>Where T is the projected temperature for future years (°C) and T
 <sub>o</sub> is the base temperature (°C) at the stage of construction when the joints were installed. Thus, the superstructure of the bridge will expand from T
 <sub>o</sub> to T (maximum temperature of exposition), and contracts from T
 <sub>o</sub> to the minimum temperature of exposition. During instalation, and to ensure proper performance, when T
 <sub>o</sub> is at mid range (average of maximum and minimum temperature that the bridge is subjected), the joint can be set at mid movement range. However, if T
 <sub>o</sub> is above or below the mid range, the joint gap needs to be reduced or increased, respectively [
