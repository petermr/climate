<p>Once the expansion joints are clogged and the structure is exposed to a temperature variation, the superstructure is restrained from expanding. As a result, thermal stresses not predicted in the original design, are induced onto the girders and slab. The corresponding thermal load P (kN) that develops due to restraining of expansion of the superstructure, is accounted for in the first term of the interaction equation and can be computed according to Eq (
