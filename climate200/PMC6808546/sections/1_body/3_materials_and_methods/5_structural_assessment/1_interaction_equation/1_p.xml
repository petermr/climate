<p>Herein, the vulnerability of bridges with clogged joints that are subjected to temperature rise is quantified in terms of the interaction equation. A total of 89,089 simply supported steel girder bridges (SSSG) with compact section are evaluated. In this study we chose to evaluate only compact sections since the section capacity is governed by plastic behavior. The capacity of non-compact sections could have also been evaluated but would require much more information than what was readily available in the NBI database.</p>
