<p>The plot of the average IEV as function of average temperature range for all bridges under analysis (difference between the future temperature and the base temperature of bridge construction during the fall) provides a linear relationship, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g006">Fig 6</xref>. Specifically, an interesting finding is that for each 1°C increment in temperature range (ΔT), the IEV increases by approximately 2%, which indicates a continuous reduction in bridge integrity throughout the country, if no intervention is conducted.
