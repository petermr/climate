<p>Finally, the average IEVs are evaluated by state level for three hypothetical scenarios: optimistic–construction during the summer and projected temperatures under RCP 2.6; moderate–construction during the fall and projected temperatures under RCP 6.0; and the worst-case–construction during the winter and projected temperatures under RCP 8.5. This analysis considers the projected temperatures in 2100 (long-term analysis) and the results are spatially shown around the U.S. in
