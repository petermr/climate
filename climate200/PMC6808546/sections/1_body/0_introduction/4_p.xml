<p>The 2017 NBI reveals that four in ten bridges are 50 years or older, reaching or even exceeding their design life with the average age of bridges in America being 45 years old [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, it is noted that 54,560 bridges in U.S. were characterized as being structurally deficient [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] where ‘deficient’ implies that elements of the bridge structure were found in poor conditions due to deterioration or damage [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite the poor conditions of these bridges, there were approximately 188 million trips across them each day in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Undoubtedly large spending is required to address a host of deterioration issues in these bridges. These issues include clogging of expansion joints with road debris, scour of foundations caused by water flow, corrosion of structural elements and components due to improper drainage or leakage through damaged expansion joints, deck deterioration due to standing water and deicers, decay or misalignment of bearings, cracks in bases due to uneven settling of foundation, among others [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is important to note that the effect of these listed problems on bridge performance will vary in terms of their level of impact. For example, deck deterioration is expected to cause traffic delay while large scour could threaten the integrity of the structure. Of course, it is important to acknowledge that the criticality of each of these problems might change due to their coupling nature. In this study, we chose to focus on expansion joints in bridges. This is because even though innumerable components of the bridges throughout the country require maintenance or replacement, the deterioration of bridge deck expansion joints, is one of the most common issues [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In spite of being small components, if expansion joints do not perform properly, it can affect major structural elements of a bridge [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This problem becomes even more significant given the abundance of deck joints bridges in the country. Such frequency is the result of the widespread adoption of simply supported spans design type, which facilitated the construction of a large quantity of roadways in U.S. after the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act. However, at that time, potential issues and costs associated with maintenance of deck joints were overlooked [
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0223307.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As such, the maintenance cost to keep expansion joints clean and functional has been a burden to the American transportation agencies [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223307.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows what is typically known as major potential damages to structural elements of simply supported bridges due to the combination of clogged joints condition and unpredicted thermal stresses. These include local buckling of the main girder flanges, spalling of concrete of the abutments, and cracking and crushing of the roadway deck. Some of these issues could arguably fall under the category of serviceability limits. Meaning, local buckling for example would not compromise the safety of the structure. In this study we focus on what is typically an overlooked but critical issue. That is to evaluate the effect of joint clogging on increasing the demand on bridge girders and the deck slab which are the main load carrying elements of the superstructure. The criticality of evaluating this criterion stems from the fact that failure of the girders and crushing in the concrete deck could simply compromise the functionality and structural integrity of the bridge. The integrity, or lack of residual capacity, will depend on the level of redundancy in the bridge and the presence of alternative load path. That is to say failure of the girders and crushing of the concrete may or may not present major safety concerns; however, immediate actions should be taken.
