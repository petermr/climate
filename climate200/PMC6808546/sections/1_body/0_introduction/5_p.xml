<p>Expansion joints are transversal spaced gaps along the bridge length, with the purpose of allowing longitudinal movements of expansion and contraction of the superstructure when it is subjected to a temperature variation. Nevertheless, they easily become clogged with debris, preventing the bridge from expanding when it is exposed to a temperature rise. In addition, deteriorated joints allow debris, water and deicing salts to infiltrate underneath the bridge deck and accumulate where the bearings are located. This could cause the sliding bearings, which are components that transfer the loads from the superstructure to the substructure of the bridge and allow thermal movement of the girders as well, to corrode and lock up, further preventing the bridge from accommodating thermal movements [

According to the recently released Climate Change Adaption Guide for Transportation Systems Management Operations and Maintenance (U.S Department of Transportationâ€“Federal Highway Administration), bridges with joints are more susceptible to damage due to their sensitivity to temperature [

Therefore, more attention should be given for these joints since change in climate may require different maintenance and rehabilitation approaches. This was further highlighted by the ASCE Committee on Adaptation to a Changing Climate who not only noted the importance of adapting transportation infrastructure to a changing climate but also emphasized that a changing climate may affect bridge expansion joints [
