<p>In this study, we evaluate the vulnerability of SSSG bridges in the U.S. under the combined effect of clogged joints and projected temperature rise for 2040, 2060, 2080 and 2100, considering the climate model from the NOAAâ€™s (National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GFDL-CM3 under three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which are named for the approximate radiative forcing in year 2100: the lower forcing scenario RCP 2.6, a moderate scenario RCP 6.0 and the higher forcing scenario RCP 8.5 [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">Materials and methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223307.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). One should be aware that this study does not intent to examine all the existing climate models in order to exhaustively minimize uncertainties for future temperatures prediction. Instead, the present study correlates potential temperature rising with the vulnerability of infrastructure. Ultimately, it aims to offer insights on vulnerability of a massive bridge inventory so that management policies can be devised.
