 <caption> Comparing per capita CO 2 emissions with global temperature changes. Temperature anomaly (solid line) above the 1850-1900 baseline value and CO 2 emissions per capita (dashed line) are shown for the 1850-2014. Data was obtained from the CDIAC data repository [ 35]. It is clear that despite exceeding a 1 degree temperature anomaly, the global emissions per capita of CO 2 show no obvious signs of decreasing. The current temperature anomaly is not yet high enough to spark a global decrease in emissions. (TIFF) </caption>
