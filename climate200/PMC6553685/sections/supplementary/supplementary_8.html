 <caption> Climate trends with and without adaptation to climate change. Removing adaptive behaviour from the model (by forcing the proportion of mitigators to remain at a constant, low value) results in saturating emissions and temperature increasing indefinitely (at least over the next two centuries). This is akin to the RCP8.5 scenario in the latest IPCC report (trajectory shown in Fig 1). Simulations above use parameter values drawn from triangular distributions with upper and lower bounds given in S2 Table. (TIFF) </caption>
