  <title>Functional form for perceived costs associated with climate change.</title>
  <p>The incentive of individuals to mitigate is in part based on their perceived costs of climate change 
   <italic>f</italic> at some projected temperature 
   <italic>T</italic>. We adopt a sigmoidal response curve for 
   <italic>f</italic>(
   <italic>T</italic>) with variable curvature 
   <italic>Ï‰</italic> and horizontal shift 
   <italic>T</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>c</italic>
   </sub> (the explicit form of 
   <italic>f</italic>(
   <italic>T</italic>) is provided in Methods). This form captures the expected non-linear increase in climate change impacts (cost) as temperature increases.
