<p>Just as human behaviour influences climate trends, climate change in turn influences human behaviour concerning GHG emissions, including both climate change mitigation and adaptation [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Individuals in places with rising average temperatures are more likely to perceive climate change [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and social effects are apparent when individuals take steps in response to such shifting perceptions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is also an important distinction between social learning and social normsâ€”socially accepted and widely practised modes of conduct [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Social norms are known to have a strong influence on human behaviour [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] including aspects relating to climate change [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and therefore play an important role in determining emission trajectories [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Multiple studies show a tendency for individuals to conform to emerging norms in support of climate change mitigation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, it appears that individuals are often not consciously aware of the importance of social norms in their decision-making and instead falsely ascribe their decisions to other factors [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is important to note that social norms do not automatically promote socially beneficial outcomes. They can equally well force conformity to a destructive norm such as political extremism [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This also happens in the context of climate change behaviour, where it has been found that individuals may also conform to a norm of non-mitigation, by adjusting their habits to match those of less environmentally friendly neighbours [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
