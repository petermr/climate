<p>Hence, Earth’s climate and human subsystems are part of a single coupled system where social dynamics play a vital role. Yet, models of Earth’s coupled climate-behaviour system remain essentially undeveloped. One such approach [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] couples a sophisticated climate model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to a model for individual behavioural change based on the theory of planned behaviour—a dominant paradigm in psychology [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The authors find that the sensitivity of global temperature change to human factors such as response to extreme events, social norms and perceived ability to adopt mitigative strategies is of a similar magnitude to its sensitivity to geophysical factors. They deduce that quantifying behavioural uncertainty and physical uncertainty in climate projections deserve equal attention. The model focuses on how individual psychology and behaviour are influenced by extreme weather events. Social effects are modelled phenomenologically (i.e., exogenously imposed): individuals do not learn behaviour or opinions from one another, and social norms are treated as a fixed effect that does not depend on the population’s current composition of attitudes.
