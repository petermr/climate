<p>Our baseline model assumes that individuals’ perceived cost of climate change impacts depends on a linear extrapolation of the recent temperature anomaly over the previous ten years (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). If individuals instead base their decisions only on the current temperature anomaly, the simulated global temperature anomaly lies well above the 2°C target set by the IPCC, and exhibits wide variation in sensitivity analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This contrasts with our baseline model where the population movement towards mitigative strategies ignites earlier, significantly reducing the global temperature anomaly. This predicted dynamic stems from the multi-decadal lag between GHG emissions and the consequent global temperature rise [
