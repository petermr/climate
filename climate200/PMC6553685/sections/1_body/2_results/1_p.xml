<p>The model demonstrates how the social learning rate can strongly determine temperature trends. We first consider a null hypothesis where adaptive behaviour is removed from the model by forcing the proportion of mitigators in the population to remain constant. In this case of fixed behaviour, emissions saturate and the temperature anomaly increases indefinitely (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007000.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). However, once social learning is added and the proportion of mitigators is allowed to evolve dynamically as in our baseline model, the predicted average global temperature anomaly can peak anywhere from 2.2°C, near the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) limit [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (in the case of very rapid social learning) to 3.5°C (in the more realistic case where social learning unfolds on a generational timescale) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1a–1c</xref>). Whether people discuss climate change more or less often can therefore strongly influence temperature trends. Because we model social norms as something that tends to reinforce majority behaviour and attitudes—whatever they might be—one might think that social norms act as a double-edged sword. In fact, they operate more like an unhelpful scimitar, as illustrated by comparing cases of low and high strength of social norms. Because the population starts off from a state of largely non-mitigating behaviour, increasing the strength of social norms suppresses the spread of mitigating behaviour for decades by entrenching non-mitigation as a norm, even when rising temperatures strongly justify an immediate shift (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1d–1f</xref>). (This model dynamic echoes not only current climate norms reinforcing non-mitigation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but also past social shifts occurring on decadal timescales, such as evolving social norms about when and where smoking is acceptable.) However, when mitigating behaviour eventually does become widespread, a higher strength of social norms does not significantly accelerate its spread. Rather, the two curves for cases of high and low social norm strength simply move in parallel to one another because by this time, the utility function that determines behaviour change is dominated by the large temperature anomaly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007000.g001">Fig 1d</xref>). In this parameter regime, social norms generate a perverse asymmetry, in contrast to findings from other socio-climate models that assume social norms can only support climate change mitigation [
