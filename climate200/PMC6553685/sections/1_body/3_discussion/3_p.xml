<p>In a different vein, we assumed a homogeneous population with respect to mixing and individual utilities. The model’s social dynamics capture interactions at the individual level, though there are many different scales of social organisation that the model does not consider, from families/neighbourhoods to cities/states and up to interacting countries. Future models could include this more hierarchical social structure. Similarly, these models could include different types of individual with correspondingly different utilities. For instance, the model could include industrial corporations with utilities biased toward shareholder profit, and social institutions (such as laws, taxes, the education system) that reflect the current governmental stance. Social learning may also take on different forms due to diverse individual psychologies and values [

Our model also makes the simplifying assumption that individuals base their temperature projection on linear extrapolation of past temperatures. This could be generalised to a non-linear extrapolation to reflect an individual’s perception of ‘accelerating’ change. Extending socio-climate models to include these finer details should prove valuable in further investigations.
