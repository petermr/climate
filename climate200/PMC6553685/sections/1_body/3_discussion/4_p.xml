<p>Climate change is a manifestation of coupled human-environment dynamics and therefore we should start coupling climate models to social models [

Our simple coupled socio-climate model shows that the rate at which individuals learn socially strongly influences the peak global temperature anomaly, to the point that variation of this parameter within plausible ranges changes the peak temperature anomaly by more than 1Â°C. Therefore, it matters whether social processes cause slow or fast uptake of climate change mitigation measures. We found that social norms may not provide help when we most need it, although this finding could be nuanced by adding social heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrated how exploring the parameter space of socio-climate models suggests optimal paths for mitigating climate change. A more sophisticated policy impact assessment model based on a coupled socio-climate approach could therefore be useful to decision-makers facing a mandate to reduce GHG emissions with a fixed budget. In summary, it is essential for climate change research to account for dynamic social processes in order to generate accurate predictions of future climate trends, and the paradigm of coupled socio-climate modelling could help us address this challenge.
