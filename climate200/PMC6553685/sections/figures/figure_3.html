 <caption> Optimal pathways to mitigation via increasing social learning and reducing mitigation costs. Contour plot showing peak temperature anomaly at specified values of the net cost of mitigation ( β) and rate of social learning ( κ). Arrows indicate the direction of steepest descent—the most efficient combination of the two measures to reduce temperature anomalies. All other parameters are fixed at baseline values ( S2 Table). Additional details in Methods. </caption>
