 <caption> Endogenous social dynamics influence climate trajectories. Shown are ensembles of model simulations comparing two parameter values for the social learning rate ( κ) (a-c), strength of social norms ( δ) (d-f), and costs associated with mitigation ( β) (g-i). All other parameters are drawn from triangular probability distributions with defined upper, lower and baseline values ( S2 Table). Displayed are median trajectories with 95% confidence intervals from an ensemble of 100 realisations. Additional details in Methods. </caption>
