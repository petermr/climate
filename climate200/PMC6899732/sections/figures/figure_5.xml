  <p>(a, c) Concentrations of sinigrin (a, c) and (b, d) total sugars of 
   <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> plants exposed to different herbivory treatments (none [white bars[, 
   <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> [gray bars], 
   <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> [black bars]) and rainfall regimes: none (R00), only before caterpillars were introduced (R10), only after caterpillars were introduced (R01), or during both phases (R11). Values are mean and SE. Insect herbivores were exposed to different frequencies of rainfall: (a, b) once (20 min) per day or (c, d) three times (5 min each) per day.
