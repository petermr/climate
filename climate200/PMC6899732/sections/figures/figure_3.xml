 <caption>
  <p>(a, c) Development time from L2 to adult eclosion and (b, d) adult body mass of 
   <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> on 
   <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> plants exposed to different rainfall regimes: none (R00), only before caterpillars were introduced (R10), only after caterpillars were introduced (R01), or during both phases (R11). Note that axes of development time do not start at zero. Values are mean and SE. Insect herbivores were exposed to different frequencies of rainfall: (a, b) once (20 min) per day or (c, d) three times (5 min each) per day.
