<p>Species interactions, such as those occurring between plants and insects, are not only affected by the biotic environment (e.g., presence of competitors and predators, quality and quantity of resources), but also by the abiotic environment (Schoonhoven et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Abiotic factors such as temperature, wind, and rain can directly or indirectly affect insect herbivores feeding on their host plants (Schoonhoven et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). For instance, heavy rainfall can dislodge insects from the plants (Kobori and Amano 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) and can also affect microclimatic conditions (through cooling; Dobkin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1987</xref>, Kamata and Igarashi 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>), which, like temperature in general, strongly affects the developmental rate of ectotherms. Indirectly, insect herbivores can be influenced through effects of abiotic factors on survival, fitness, and foraging behavior of their natural enemies and herbivorous competitors. Indirect plant‐mediated effects of abiotic factors on insect herbivores may occur if these factors influence plant traits determining food plant quality for insect herbivores. Variation in temperature and precipitation may change levels of primary and secondary metabolites in plant tissues that are consumed by the herbivores, affecting their growth and development (Jamieson et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). It has also been reported that the emission of volatile plant metabolites is affected by rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature (Vallat et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>, Loreto and Schnitzler 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Changes in the emissions of plant volatiles could potentially affect the ability of insect herbivores to find host plants when these changes concern specific cues important for foraging behavior. In addition, it may affect the foraging behavior of higher trophic‐level arthropods such as predators and parasitoids that is mediated by the volatiles emitted in response to herbivory (Dicke 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, changes in abiotic factors may strongly affect species interactions.
