<p>With the exception of temperature, abiotic factors, such as rainfall and wind, are rarely considered in laboratory and greenhouse experiments investigating insect–plant interactions. However, in the field, organisms have to deal with both the biotic and abiotic environment. By greatly reducing, eliminating, or making abiotic factors static in lab experiments, some of the results may have limited value. Therefore, it is important to determine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors when studying plant–herbivore (multitrophic) interactions. In a previous study (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), we showed that wind exposure can extend larval development time of two lepidopteran herbivores, 
 <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (L.) (Plutellidae) and 
 <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> (L.) (Pieridae), respectively. Interestingly, wind exposure also reduced adult biomass of 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, whereas butterflies of 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> were heavier on wind‐exposed plants. Plant‐mediated effects were relatively small (Chen et al.
