<p>Black mustard,

 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1980</xref>). Like other members of the Brassicaceae family, it produces secondary compounds known as glucosinolates (GS; Fahey et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). GS can act as feeding deterrents or exhibit negative effects on the growth and development of non‐adapted phytophages and their natural enemies, while they can be used as feeding and oviposition cues by specialist enemies (Gols and Harvey

 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Concentrations of these compounds are also known to change in response to herbivory (Textor and Gershenzon 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). We measured GS, as well as sugar concentrations, in leaf tissues in plants exposed to the various downpour and herbivore treatments described below. Sugars are powerful feeding stimulants for many insects and, in addition to nitrogen, are important determinants of the nutritional quality of host plants (Awmack and Leather
