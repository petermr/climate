<p>Plants were grown from seeds in a greenhouse (22° ± 3°C, 50–70% relative humidity and a 16‐h photoperiod. One‐week‐old seedlings were transferred to 2‐L pots (one plant per pot) filled with potting soil (Lentse potgrond no. 4: Lentse, Lent, The Netherlands). Extra soil was added to each pot, including those that were not exposed to downpours, creating a mount around the stem that was covered with tin foil to accommodate runoff of water during the downpours and to avoid that nutrients would leach from the soil. Pots were placed in saucers for manual watering. All plants were well‐watered. Downpour‐exposure treatments were divided into two phases: growth phase of the plants before introduction of the insects (phase 1) and insect exposure phase (phase 2). Plants were allocated to one of the following four downpour treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>): (1) control (no exposure to downpours), (2) exposure to downpour only during phase 1, (3) only during phase 2, and (4) during both phases. We refer to these treatments as R00, R10, R01, and R11, respectively, where the two digits refer to the two phases and 0 and 1 to downpour treatments (0, no; 1, yes). The four precipitation regimes allowed us to separate the indirect, plant‐mediated effects of downpours on the herbivores (R10, R11 vs. R00, R01) from predominantly direct effects (R01, R11 vs. R00, R10). Rainfall was simulated using nozzles (full cone Hardi nozzles, type 1553; Homburg Holland, Stiens, The Netherlands) with an intensity of ~20.9 mm water/h. The nozzles were attached to a frame approximately 2 m above movable tables (80 × 80 cm, one nozzle per table). In total, there were 12 tables with simulated rainfall and 12 tables without simulated rainfall, which were each placed in rows of six tables (Fig.
