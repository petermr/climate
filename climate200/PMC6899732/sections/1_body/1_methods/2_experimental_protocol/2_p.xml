<p>Two independent experiments were performed each with newly grown plants. In the first experiment, the frequency of rain was set at once a day for 20 min at 09:00. In the second experiment, the frequency of rain was increased to three times a day (09:00, 14:00, and 19:00) and the duration of each downpour was reduced to 5 min. Tables were moved within the greenhouse according to their assigned downpour treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the single downpour experiment, phase 1 was initiated 3 weeks after seedlings were transplanted and lasted 7 d whereas in the triple downpour experiment phase 1 was initiated 1 week after seedlings were transplanted and lasted 21 d. In both experiments, caterpillars were introduced when the plants were 4 weeks old. Phase 2, in which plants were exposed to herbivory, lasted approximately 7 d for

 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> due to differences in larval development time (see paragraph below).
