<p>The development time of both herbivores was extended by both direct and indirect (plant‚Äêmediated) effects of exposure to rainfall whereas the effects on biomass were not very consistent as they differed depending on the frequency of rainfall as well as between the two herbivore species. The direct effect of downpours on development time was possibly caused by the fact that during downpours caterpillars do not feed. Even after the downpour ended, feeding was not immediately resumed. We also found that the temperature near the leaf surface dropped dramatically in response to the downpours, and it took more than 1 h before the temperature returned to its original level. Metabolism and growth rate in ectotherms such as insects are strongly determined by ambient temperature. In addition to disturbance, microclimatic cooling caused by rain may explain the extended immature development times of the two herbivores.</p>
