<p>Indirect, plant‐mediated effects of downpours (R00, R01 vs. R10, R11) on insect survival were relatively small and depended on whether plants were exposed to downpours while the caterpillars were feeding on the plants (interaction between direct and indirect effects, Appendix S1: Table 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). There were no indirect effects of downpours on immature development times and adult biomass of 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> in the single downpour experiment (development time,

Only in the experiment with triple downpours, both development time and biomass were affected by indirect effects of rainfall regime, but this depended on whether the larvae were exposed to rain or not (interaction between direct and indirect effects; development time,
