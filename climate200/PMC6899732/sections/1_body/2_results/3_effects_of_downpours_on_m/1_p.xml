<p>Downpours had a significant effect on the temperature of the leaf surface (

 <sub>3,20</sub> = 10.5, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001) and temperature depended on the time point that it was measured (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>6, 253</sub> = 36.2, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001). In response to downpours, the temperature immediately dropped by approximately 5°C and it took at least an hour to return to the original temperature (Appendix S1: Fig.
