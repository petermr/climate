<p>In the single downpour experiment, leaf concentrations of sinigrin, the dominant GS produced by 
 <italic>B. nigra</italic>, were not affected by downpours during phase 1 (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>1,20</sub> = 3.02, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.10), but increased significantly in response to downpours during phase 2 (

 <italic> </italic>0.001, Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Overall, sinigrin concentrations were higher in leaf tissues of plants exposed to herbivory than on plants without herbivores, and this effect was stronger when plants were also exposed to downpours during the insect feeding phase (

 <sub>2,40</sub> = 6.82, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.003; both herbivores: Tukey HSD tests, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the second experiment in which plants were exposed to three brief downpours per day, sinigrin concentrations tended to be high irrespective of the rainfall regime and herbivore treatment (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a and c). In the absence of downpours during the insect feeding phase (R00, R10), sinigrin levels were not affected by 
 <italic>P. xylostella</italic> and actually decreased in the presence of 
 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2819-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). By contrast, in the presence of downpours during the insect feeding phase (R10, R11), sinigrin levels were slightly increased by caterpillar feeding, resulting in a significant interaction between herbivory and downpour regime during the insect feeding phase (
