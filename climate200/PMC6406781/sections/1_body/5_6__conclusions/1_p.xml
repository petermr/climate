<p>The evaluation of lay people’s perception is a popularly accepted method to study climate change at the local level [

 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The aim of the present research was to generate knowledge on the extent to which shrimp cultivators perceived changes in climate in Bangladesh. Local perception of obvious weather changes was associated with increasing frequency of climate extremes like cyclones and storm surges as well as with temperature increase that they feel and gauge in their own way without the help of any scientific instruments. Although aquaculturists are not much acquainted with the term SLR, they assess the changes by comparing the water level in nearby rivers at present with that of 10–15 years ago. They also perceive the increased level of water and soil salinity by observing the gradual loss of vegetation in the area. They understand changes in climate through perceived negative impacts that the changes might have on local ecosystems, human health, and overall livelihoods. Shrimp farmers are aware about how their lives are affected by the changing and erratic pattern of rainfall, temperature, salinity, and climate extremes.
