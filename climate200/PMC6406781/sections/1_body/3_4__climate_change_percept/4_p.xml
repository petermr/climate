<p>Raising livestock has become difficult. Grazing land has reduced. Though a portion of existing livestock died or was wounded during Sidr and Aila, the major setback came from the shortage of their food. Grassland reduced, vegetation hampered, and rice cultivation haltedâ€”all these lead to a significant decrease in livestock in the areas; local people link these phenomena with climate change.Aquaculture community also observed more insects and pests in crops, vegetables, and fruit trees. The people who grow fruits and vegetables on highlands and home yards for some time in a year reported frequent pest attacks. They associate this with shifting pattern in seasons. </p>
