<p>In addition to changes in the above-mentioned primary indicators of weather and climate, people perceive other related changes in the environment. According to their opinions, the number of trees in the vicinity has reduced drastically. Especially after the devastating Sidr and Aila, most of the old trees died because of severe soil salinity. Making landfall during high tide in late May in 2009, cyclone Aila was associated with tidal surges of up to 6.5 meters, affecting 3.9 million people in 11 coastal districts [

Storm surges engulfed the whole areas overtopping the embankments by side of the rivers and saline water from the sea remained within the polders in whole areas of Koyra and Shyamnagar years after those catastrophes, due to drainage congestion in the polders. During the 1960s, earthen embankments were made along the banks of major rivers under the Coastal Embankment Project in the then East Pakistan in order to protect the reclaimed land from saline tidal surges and to enhance agricultural production in the area [

One shrimp farmer from Koyra sighed, ‘Aila destroyed the history of the past 100 years’, referring to the loss of vegetation in the area. Aila wiped out most of the fruit trees in the affected areas including mango, banana, jackfruit, litchi etc. Farmers from Mongla reported that the fruit trees, which grew well in coastal areas previously like coconut and areca, are now struggling to survive. After Aila, local people attempted to plant trees, but those attempts mostly failed because of excessive salinity in water and soil. According to them, most of the tree species died just a couple of days after planting, especially for the first three years after Aila. For the last couple of years some newly planted trees are surviving. Until now, fruit trees’ survival rates are low, only saline tolerant species like caraway grow well.
