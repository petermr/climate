<p>People had previously experienced shattering natural disasters like cyclone Sidr and Aila and anticipate more disasters in the future due to a shift in the climate regime. Their understanding of climate variability is essentially drawn from proxy or secondary indicators like crop failure, scarcity of fish in open water, livestock loss, increased sickness as well as the shared experiences of other members of the community. The community does not use any modern technologies to gauge weather changes; rather they attribute sickness, crop failures and other phenomena such as extreme heat or cold events or natural disasters. From 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00672-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> we find that farmersâ€™ perceptions of climate shifts significantly match with scientific findings. Though the interviewed rural people have little formal education and live on aquaculture and agriculture, they have clear perceptions of the changes in weather parameters that had taken place. Similarly, striking conclusions were drawn by Haque et al. (2012) researching on climate change perceptions of local people in Khulna and Rajshahi [

In a study in the shrimp aquaculture community in Mongla, one of the sites of this study, Shameem, Momtaz and Kiem (2015) found a high correlation between scientific evidence and local perceptions of climate change, at least for short-term variability [
