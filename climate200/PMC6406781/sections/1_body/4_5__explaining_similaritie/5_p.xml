<p>Within this context, different stakeholders venture to transmit climate change messages to the public. Radio, TV, and newspapers frequently publish news reports, features, and articles on human-induced warming of atmosphere. Government and non-government agencies and organizations prioritize climate change agenda in their programmes and projects. Especially NGOs make people aware about likely changes in the climate and devise various coping strategies in their projects, particularly in disaster-prone areas like the south-western coast. For example, we found several NGO projects running in the research areas at the time of field survey for this study. To name a few of the projects: Disaster, Environment and Climate Change (DECC) by BRAC, Increasing Resilience and Reducing Risk of Coastal Communities to Climate Change and Natural Hazards in the Bay of Bengal (Paribartan) By JJS, and Strengthening Livelihood Security of Climate Change Vulnerable People by LEDARS. All the above-discussed factors make local people aware of the changes in weather, climate, and the environment. </p>
