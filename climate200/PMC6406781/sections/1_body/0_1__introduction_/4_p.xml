<p>Drawing on above narratives, this paper reports on a risk perception study that was carried out to gain an understanding of commercial shrimpers’ perception of climate change impacts on the industry in coastal Bangladesh. We also analyze the factors that contribute to specific understanding of weather and climate in the research areas. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-16-00672">Section 2</xref> discusses the two conceptual lenses that frame this study: climate risk perception, and media representation of climate change. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-16-00672">Section 3</xref> describes the methods of data collection for this study. In 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijerph-16-00672">Section 4</xref>, we provide an examination of how shrimping communities of Bangladesh understand the recent changes in weather and climate. In 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-ijerph-16-00672">Section 5</xref>, we try to assess why there are similarities between local people’s perceptions and scientific data on climate change in Bangladesh. We conclude in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-ijerph-16-00672">Section 6</xref> by summarizing our findings and showing their broader implications.
