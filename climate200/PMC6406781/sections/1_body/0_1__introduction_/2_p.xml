<p>Industrial shrimp, locally known as ‘white gold’ [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] because of its high transnational value, is a ‘multimillion dollar industry in Bangladesh’ [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Bangladesh is the sixth contributor in global aquaculture [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], supplying about 5% of global shrimp production [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This sector directly or indirectly benefits nearly 15 million people [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while providing subsistence directly to 1.2 million people in Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The growth of this sector is retarded by environmental and climate change phenomena, among others. Coastal Bangladesh, where shrimp is cultured, is frequently affected by extreme climate events like cyclones and storm surges that severely damage the entire coastal aquaculture [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Bangladesh, as a whole, is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate risks, a fact that made it a hotspot in the world [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Climate change vulnerability of the country lies in the fact that two-thirds of the country is less than 5 meters above sea level [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and is projected to lose 17.5% of its land if sea level rises about 1 meter [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], thereby displacing millions of people. Based on data from the 1980–2000 period, Bangladesh was identified by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the most vulnerable country in the world to tropical cyclones [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the sixth most vulnerable country to floods [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Every three years on average, a severe cyclone hits coastal Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cyclone Sidr alone resulted in damages and losses of about USD 1.7 billion, or 2.6% of the GDP in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Super Cyclone Sidr hit the Bangladesh coastal line in November 2007 with a sustained wind speed up to 250 km/h and storm surges up to 9.1 meters, affecting livelihoods of around 8.9 million people with a death toll of 3406 [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The same cyclone washed away about 54,000 shrimp farms and hatcheries in the coastal districts [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-00672" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
