<p>1) Similar considerations apply to agriculture and land use, responsible for approximately a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. More sustainable agricultural production measures, such as reducing open burning of agricultural land, would help mitigate climate change and reduce air pollution in some regions. However, even greater gains may be obtained by reducing human consumption of meat and by reducing food waste. Even though meat and dairy make a relatively small contribution to overall human energy intake, around 60â€“80% of the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture come from the livestock sector, which also has a range of additional environmental impacts, from deforestation to water contamination and degradation of topsoil, which are increasing with the growing demand from emerging economies.

 </xref> Reducing meat intake in high-consuming populations can therefore be expected to significantly reduce environmental impacts. Modelling the effect of potential strategies to meet national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland look promising. For example, reducing livestock production and consumption of red meat, indicated that these strategies could be expected to result in a 15% reduction in disease burden due to reduced consumption of saturated fats and associated heart disease.
