<p>Some of the same pollutants contribute both to climate change and local ambient and household air pollution. Black carbon, produced by inefficient combustion in sources such as cookstoves and diesel engines, is the second greatest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide.

 </xref> Black carbon is also a significant contributor (between 5% and 15%) of urban exposure to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. The second largest contributor to global warming is methane, which reacts with other pollutants to form ozone and is responsible for 230  000 chronic respiratory disease deaths globally each year.

 </xref> Both of these pollutants are short-lived in the atmosphere, meaning that targeting them for removal would have immediate beneficial effects on both climate change and noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke and deaths from cardiovascular disease. A set of 16 practical interventions, from replacing polluting cookstoves with cleaner household energy solutions, to replacing the most polluting diesel fuels and engines with less polluting ones, would prevent approximately 0.5°C of global warming, and save some 2.5 million lives a year by 2050.
