<p>The connection between the sources of local air pollution and the emissions that drive climate change is very clear. Estimations show that approximately 25% of urban ambient air pollution from fine particulate matter (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) is contributed by traffic, 15% by industrial activities including electricity generation, 20% by domestic fuel burning (with a remaining 22% from unspecified sources of human origin and 18% from natural sources).

 </xref> Exposure to indoor air pollution is mostly due to the use of solid fuels for cooking in low-income households.

 </xref> Such exposure causes almost 4 million deaths a year, of which almost 3Â million are due to noncommunicable diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke.
