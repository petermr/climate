<p>In the transport sector, an accelerated transition from diesel and petrol engines to electric powered vehicles would contribute to reducing emissions of local air pollutants and greenhouse gas. Much greater health gains, however, would result from replacing short urban car journeys with walking and cycling, due to increases in physical activity. Modelling based on systematic reviews of the health effects of increased active travel indicated that reductions in air pollution due to increased active travel could prevent 21 premature deaths per million population per year in London, and 99 per million population per year in Delhi. The gains of physical activity are expected to be even greater. As one third of adults and four-fifths of adolescents do not reach the activity levels recommended by WHO, it is estimated that the disability-adjusted life years saved from increased physical activity due to active travel policies could be 37 to 74 times higher than those saved from the reductions in air pollution.
