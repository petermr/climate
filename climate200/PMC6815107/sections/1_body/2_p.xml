<p>We developed simulation models of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to the collapse of the Mojave Desert bird community over the last century that has been explicitly linked to climate change (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Since the original surveys by Joseph Grinnell and others in the early 20th century, Mojave sites, situated mostly within national parks and reserves with minimal land use change, have lost on average 43% of their bird species. Occupancy probability significantly declined for 39 of 135 (29%) breeding birds, while only one species significantly increased. Climate change, particularly a long-term decline in precipitation, was the most important driver of site-level persistence of species (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Drying conditions should impose the greatest pressure on homeothermy in warming environments by increasing water requirements for cooling, while simultaneously limiting the availability of water. Here, we evaluated the prediction that persistence of bird species over the past century should be lowest at hot, dry sites due to greater water requirements for cooling. We then estimated species-specific cooling requirements in 50 species using a simulation-based approach that linked climate warming to biophysical traits, such as body size, shape, and plumage properties. We focused on cooling costs because water requirements for homeothermy in birds increase exponentially under warm conditions, leading to potentially lethal dehydration under climate change (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We used our simulations to 1) test whether increases in cooling requirements over the past century were associated with occupancy declines species experienced in the Mojave, and 2) explore cooling requirements as a mechanism underlying Bergmannâ€™s rule.
