<p>Many bird species did not exhibit significant variation in body size with climate, consistent with other analyses (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our analysis indicates that the physiological mechanism underlying body size clines may be related to total cooling costs, rather than mass-specific heating and cooling as others have proposed (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Geographic variation in body size likely depends upon the impact of behavior, physiology, and morphology on the magnitude of total cooling costs, as well as the extent to which species experience extreme environmental conditions across their geographic range. Exploring these interactions will reveal the multiple processes driving the high degree of interspecific variation in the support for Bergmannâ€™s rule (
