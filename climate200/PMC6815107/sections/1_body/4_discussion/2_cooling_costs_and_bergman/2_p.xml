<p>Our analysis suggests that cooling costs can be both a cause and a consequence of geographic variation in body size. Reductions in body size in hot environments was associated with sustained occupancy over the past century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmann’s rule. Species exhibiting a pattern counter to Bergmann’s rule comprised 20% of our sample, implying mechanisms unrelated to thermoregulation to underlie geographic variation in body size (
