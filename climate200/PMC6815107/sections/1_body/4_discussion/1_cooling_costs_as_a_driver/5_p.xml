<p>The observed declines in larger birds conflicts with recent predictions that smaller birds are more vulnerable to water-related challenges than larger birds due to high surface area-to-volume ratios (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A higher ratio results in smaller birds more rapidly reaching critical dehydration tolerances, all else equal. However, this perspective does not capture the need for greater absolute water intake requirements of larger-bodied species. These opposing perspectives reflect the long-standing debate on whether higher mass-specific fluxes of water or heat, as opposed to the total flux, are more ecologically relevant (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In our study, we found no support for mass- or surface area-specific rates explaining declines (

 </xref>). Models that explicitly incorporate water intake also indicate that small-bodied birds balance water budgets more easily (
