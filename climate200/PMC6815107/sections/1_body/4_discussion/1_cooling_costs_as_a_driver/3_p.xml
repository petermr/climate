<p>We demonstrated that avian declines were strongly correlated with the increase in water requirements for homeothermy (

 </ext-link>). The increase in cooling costs also disproportionately affected species based upon their dietary preferences. Dietary preferences influence the source of preformed water, a factor not considered in recent studies of water-related stress from climate change in birds (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Desert birds with animal-based diets infrequently drink surface water, instead relying predominantly on their prey for water (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Increased cooling costs translate into higher foraging rates, exacerbating water loss through increased activity (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and solar exposure (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Because birds with plant-based diets drink from free surface water, balancing water budgets appears less likely to be related to thermoregulatory costs and more likely to be affected by the distance from surface water (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Thus, the physiological basis of climate change in desert birds may act through its effects on the magnitude of cooling costs for insectivores and carnivores, whereas its relevance for herbivores and omnivores may be determined by the distance to surface water.
