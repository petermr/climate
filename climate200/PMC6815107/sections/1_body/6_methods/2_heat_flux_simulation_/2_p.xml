<p>Cooling costs were based upon the conditions a bird experiences in the Mojave Desert National Preserve (35°00′39″ N, −115°28′24″ W) during July, the average hottest month of the year (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). This site reflected the average altitude, and thus climatic conditions, of resurvey sites (simulation site, 1,285 m; average resurvey site, 1,250 m). We calculated water required for evaporative cooling for an average daily temperature cycle in July based on average air temperatures between 1900 to 1930 (when most historic surveys were conducted) and 1985 to 2015 (the period preceding our resurveys) from the BCM (
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). We calculated the difference in cooling costs between historic and modern climates for each species and used these water requirements for cooling as a covariate in statistical analyses. We converted the daily increase in cooling costs into the number of insects needed to offset the increase in water requirements for insectivorous birds (
