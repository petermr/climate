<p>We developed an index of chronic water requirements for evaporative cooling using species-specific traits from Mojave birds. We focused on 50 species for this analysis, 39 species that significantly declined in occupancy and 11 species without significant change, which encompassed the range of occupancy decline over the last century. Our index of water requirements captures the interspecific differences in thermal conditions that species experience due to their unique body size, shape, and feather properties in the same environment. Although species may have behavioral and physiological strategies for coping with thermal stress, our approach generates a conservative and standardized estimate of thermal stress while also exploring the sensitivity of physiological and behavioral strategies for reducing heat loads (
