<p>At a fundamental level, energy imbalance between an organism and its environment—manifested as changes in mass, water, and heat—drives climate vulnerability (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The primary determinants of energy exchange are environmental temperature and body size (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Body size determines an organism’s total energetic requirements, whereas temperature modulates this relationship (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Warming temperatures can influence the spatial and temporal patterns in body size by causing local energetic imbalances (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Large-bodied endotherms, for instance, simultaneously experienced rapid extinction (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and reductions in body size during Pleistocene warming (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), with analogous patterns occurring in response to human-caused climate change (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similar negative associations between body size and average annual temperature have also been reported across species’ geographic ranges in a pattern generally referred to as Bergmann’s rule (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, models of heat flux have not supported a mechanistic explanation of Bergmann’s rule (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), possibly due to their focus on the benefits of greater heat retention in large-bodied endotherms inhabiting cool climates. Given that geographic variation in body mass is more strongly associated with maximum than minimum temperatures (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), shifting perspectives to evaluate size-dependent cooling costs in hot environments might produce different insights.
