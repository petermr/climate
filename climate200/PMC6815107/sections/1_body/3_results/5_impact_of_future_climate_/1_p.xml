<p>Our simulations provide a heuristic understanding for reductions in body size and activity to decrease cooling requirements under future climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>). We estimated that Mojave birds will experience an increase in water requirements of 50 to 78% under future climate scenarios, all else held equal (

  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>). To avoid this cost, birds would need to reduce body mass by 36 to 52% on average, depending upon the warming scenario and species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). In extreme cases, body mass in birds has declined by as much as 27.2% over 49 y (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), but such reductions are rare and seem unlikely. Alternatively, birds might lessen vulnerability by reducing activity by 18 to 36% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5

 </xref>), but reductions in activity would likely reduce survival or reproductive success (
