<p>Our general model of endotherm thermoregulation accurately simulated avian evaporative water loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Simulations revealed that water requirements for evaporative cooling are greatest 2 h after midday, reduced by seeking shade, and greater in large-bodied species (
