<p>Increased cooling costs may disproportionately affect species with certain behavioral traits. Diet is especially likely to affect cooling costs by determining the primary source of water intake. Compared to plant-eating species, birds with animal-based diets infrequently drink from freestanding water (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), rely on preformed water from their prey during the hottest, driest times of year (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and tend to have higher resting water loss rates (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). For birds with more plant-based diets, meeting their requirements for water intake depends on the distance to surface water (

 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We found that cooling costs explained nearly half of the variation in decline for insectivores and carnivores (

 </xref>), consistent with our expectations. Decline in birds with plant-based diets was unrelated to the variation in cooling costs (

  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). By converting cooling costs to insect requirements, we demonstrated that body size magnifies food demands for hydration, as larger species require approximately 7 times more prey biomass per day than smaller birds to offset increased cooling costs, regardless of prey size (

 </xref>). Elevational preference, habitat preference, migratory mode, clutch size, and sexual dimorphism were not associated with occupancy decline after accounting for cooling costs (
