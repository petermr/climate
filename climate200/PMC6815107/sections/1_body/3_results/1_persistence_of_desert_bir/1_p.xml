<p>Community-level occupancy analyses revealed the probability of persistence at a site over the last century was lowest for birds in hot, dry environments (

Low persistence probabilities at the hottest, driest sites with the greatest water requirements for cooling and limited access to water suggests an underlying mechanism of species declines related to cooling costs. Moderately lower persistence also occurred in the coolest, wettest sites located in the high elevation sites when surface water was absent (
