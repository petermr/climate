  <p>Low persistence at hot, dry sites suggests water requirements underlie avian community collapse. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Avian persistence over the last century was lowest in the hottest, driest sites in the absence of surface water. Persistence was moderate in less hot and dry sites, and declined slightly in cool, wet sites likely due to factors not related to cooling costs. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Predictions for persistence in the presence of surface water indicate that persistence was much higher in areas except for hot, dry sites.
