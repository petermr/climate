 <caption>
  <p>The change in cooling costs due to geographic variation in body size and their relationship to decline in the Mojave. (
   <italic>A</italic>) The percent change in cooling costs between simulations with and without geographic variation in body size; colors indicate species with slopes that support Bergmann’s rule (blue) and countered Bergmann’s rule (red). Points with black outline indicate species that significantly supported or countered Bergmann’s rule. (
   <italic>B</italic> and 
   <italic>C</italic>) Percent change in Mojave cooling costs, weighted by uncertainty of body mass regressed against average annual temperature, was unrelated to occupancy decline for species that followed Bergmann’s rule but positively associated with decline for species that violated Bergmann’s rule; colors are as in 
   <italic>A</italic>. (
   <italic>D</italic> and 
   <italic>E</italic>) Spatial variation in size-related cooling costs for the American kestrel (
   <italic>Falco sparverius</italic>) and the prairie falcon (
   <italic>Falco mexicanus</italic>) illustrate the impact of body size variation is localized to the desert. These 2 species exhibited the greatest reduction and increase in mass in the Mojave Desert, respectively.
