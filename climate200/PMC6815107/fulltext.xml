This study links species-specific water requirements for cooling body temperature to the collapse of a Mojave Desert bird community over the past century from climate change. Species occupying the hottest, driest sites were less likely to persist. Birds with the greatest water requirements for cooling their body temperature experienced the largest declines.

Maintaining a stable body temperature is a fundamental requirement for homeothermic animals, and water is a vital resource that facilitates thermoregulation through evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments. Here, we explore the potential for thermoregulatory costs to underlie the community collapse of birds in the Mojave Desert over the past century in response to climate change. The probability of persistence was lowest for species occupying the warmest and driest sites, which imposed the greatest cooling costs. We developed a general model of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to species&#x02019; declines by simulating thermoregulatory costs in the Mojave Desert for 50 bird species representing the range of observed declines. Bird species&#x02019; declines were positively associated with climate-driven increases in water requirements for evaporative cooling and exacerbated by large body size, especially for species with animal-based diets. Species exhibiting reductions in body size across their range saved up to 14% in cooling costs and experienced less decline than species without size reductions, suggesting total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmann&#x02019;s rule. Reductions in body size, however, are unlikely to offset the 50 to 78% increase in cooling costs threatening desert birds from future climate change. As climate change spreads warm, dry conditions across the planet, water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines, providing a physiological basis for climate-driven extinctions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>thermoregulation</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>desert birds</kwd><kwd>evaporative cooling</kwd><kwd>Bergmann&#x02019;s rule</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">NSF | BIO | Division of Environmental Biology (DEB)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000155</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">1457742</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Blair O.

Vulnerability to climate change increases when environmental conditions challenge an organism&#x02019;s capacity to balance heat and water budgets (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), suggesting physiological mechanisms will underlie some population declines (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, the physiological bases of climate vulnerability are often inferred indirectly from population declines (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and empirical evidence supports the uncoupling of species interactions as the most common cause of climate-driven extinctions (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A major impediment to detecting the physiological bases of climate vulnerability is the complex nature of the organism&#x02013;climate interaction, especially for endotherms. Heat transfer through avian plumage and mammal pelage complicates our understanding of the homeothermic requirements of endotherms (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Establishing meaningful links between physiology and long-term population responses to climate change would represent a major advance for predicting endotherm climate vulnerability.</p><p>At a fundamental level, energy imbalance between an organism and its environment&#x02014;manifested as changes in mass, water, and heat&#x02014;drives climate vulnerability (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The primary determinants of energy exchange are environmental temperature and body size (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Body size determines an organism&#x02019;s total energetic requirements, whereas temperature modulates this relationship (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Warming temperatures can influence the spatial and temporal patterns in body size by causing local energetic imbalances (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Large-bodied endotherms, for instance, simultaneously experienced rapid extinction (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and reductions in body size during Pleistocene warming (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), with analogous patterns occurring in response to human-caused climate change (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similar negative associations between body size and average annual temperature have also been reported across species&#x02019; geographic ranges in a pattern generally referred to as Bergmann&#x02019;s rule (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, models of heat flux have not supported a mechanistic explanation of Bergmann&#x02019;s rule (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), possibly due to their focus on the benefits of greater heat retention in large-bodied endotherms inhabiting cool climates. Given that geographic variation in body mass is more strongly associated with maximum than minimum temperatures (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), shifting perspectives to evaluate size-dependent cooling costs in hot environments might produce different insights.</p><p>We developed simulation models of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to the collapse of the Mojave Desert bird community over the last century that has been explicitly linked to climate change (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Since the original surveys by Joseph Grinnell and others in the early 20th century, Mojave sites, situated mostly within national parks and reserves with minimal land use change, have lost on average 43% of their bird species. Occupancy probability significantly declined for 39 of 135 (29%) breeding birds, while only one species significantly increased. Climate change, particularly a long-term decline in precipitation, was the most important driver of site-level persistence of species (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Drying conditions should impose the greatest pressure on homeothermy in warming environments by increasing water requirements for cooling, while simultaneously limiting the availability of water. Here, we evaluated the prediction that persistence of bird species over the past century should be lowest at hot, dry sites due to greater water requirements for cooling. We then estimated species-specific cooling requirements in 50 species using a simulation-based approach that linked climate warming to biophysical traits, such as body size, shape, and plumage properties. We focused on cooling costs because water requirements for homeothermy in birds increase exponentially under warm conditions, leading to potentially lethal dehydration under climate change (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We used our simulations to 1) test whether increases in cooling requirements over the past century were associated with occupancy declines species experienced in the Mojave, and 2) explore cooling requirements as a mechanism underlying Bergmann&#x02019;s rule.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Persistence of Desert Birds and Climate.</title><p>Community-level occupancy analyses revealed the probability of persistence at a site over the last century was lowest for birds in hot, dry environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908791116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S1</ext-link>).

Despite being located primarily on protected lands, sites lost on average 43% of their breeding bird species and occupancy probability declined significantly for 29% of the 135 species. Our simulations revealed a potential physiological basis underlying the community collapse by linking climate with the fundamental need to thermoregulate. The probability of a species persisting was lowest at the hottest, driest sites and at sites without surface water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Together, these conditions challenge the capacity of endotherms to offload excess heat via evaporative cooling. Persistence of species was also moderately lower at cooler, wetter sites at high elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggestive of multiple underlying mechanisms. These high elevation sites were the wettest sites but also experienced the greatest increase in average temperature and a recent destructive fire (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although other factors may have contributed to the collapse, multiple lines of evidence indicate cooling costs as an important underlying mechanism.</p><p>We developed a heat flux model for birds that used similar equations derived from the same general theory as previous approaches (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), with 2 exceptions. We focused on the change in cooling costs without incorporating basal water requirements, and we modeled heat flux on the dorsal and ventral sides separately, as opposed to averaging across the whole organism. Quantifying the change in cooling costs isolated the impact of climate change on water requirements independent of the costs imposed by obligatory water loss to offset metabolic heat production (i.e., basal water requirements). Incorporating basal water requirements would not affect our interpretations, because basal cooling costs scale positively with body size (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus, incorporating these rates would further exacerbate the size-mediated impact of climate change on cooling costs. We also modeled heat flux by considering morphological differences across the dorsal and ventral sides of birds (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Simulating heat flux in this way offers an opportunity to incorporate the physiological role of morphological variation, such as differences in feather absorptance between the dorsum and ventrum (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908791116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S2</ext-link>).</p><p>We demonstrated that avian declines were strongly correlated with the increase in water requirements for homeothermy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).

The increase in cooling costs also disproportionately affected species based upon their dietary preferences. Dietary preferences influence the source of preformed water, a factor not considered in recent studies of water-related stress from climate change in birds (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Desert birds with animal-based diets infrequently drink surface water, instead relying predominantly on their prey for water (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Increased cooling costs translate into higher foraging rates, exacerbating water loss through increased activity (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) and solar exposure (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Because birds with plant-based diets drink from free surface water, balancing water budgets appears less likely to be related to thermoregulatory costs and more likely to be affected by the distance from surface water (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Thus, the physiological basis of climate change in desert birds may act through its effects on the magnitude of cooling costs for insectivores and carnivores, whereas its relevance for herbivores and omnivores may be determined by the distance to surface water.</p><p>A bird&#x02019;s sensitivity to cooling costs may also depend on its behavioral repertoire and the availability of cooler microhabitats. During the hottest periods of the day, desert birds restrict foraging to shaded microhabitats or cease foraging entirely (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The ability of small insectivores, like the Verdin, to forage in the shade reduces heat gain from the environment while maintaining energy and water intake (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), possibly contributing to the higher persistence of smaller birds over the last century. Larger birds, however, likely struggle to access cooler conditions due to the small dimensions of commonly available microhabitats (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Moreover, large carnivorous birds in the Mojave Desert are most often observed perching in direct sunlight (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), which increases water requirements for evaporative cooling from solar exposure. Desert birds can dramatically lower cooling costs by ceasing activity, finding cool microhabitats, or soaring to higher altitudes, but such behaviors involve spending less time foraging, defending territories, and finding mates (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>)&#x02014;all important components of fitness (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Having less time for fitness-related activities might also have a disproportionate impact on larger bodied birds.</p><p>The observed declines in larger birds conflicts with recent predictions that smaller birds are more vulnerable to water-related challenges than larger birds due to high surface area-to-volume ratios (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A higher ratio results in smaller birds more rapidly reaching critical dehydration tolerances, all else equal. However, this perspective does not capture the need for greater absolute water intake requirements of larger-bodied species. These opposing perspectives reflect the long-standing debate on whether higher mass-specific fluxes of water or heat, as opposed to the total flux, are more ecologically relevant (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In our study, we found no support for mass- or surface area-specific rates explaining declines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1908791116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link>).
