<p>Two studies evaluated pathogen outbreaks in northern Europe, one of the areas where climate change effects are expected to be most pronounced.

 <italic>Diplodia</italic> tip blight in Scots pine in northern Europe, which occurred in Sweden in 2016. They found that isolated attacks began approximately 10 years earlier and culminated in 90% of trees being attacked in 2016. Limited damage occurred in surrounding stands, suggesting the pathogen was a new introduction. Warm temperatures were associated with greater tree damage and slow growth, while cold and rainy conditions supported tree growth and impaired attacks. Significantly, the study identified no restrictions to 
 <italic>Diplodia</italic> tip blight becoming a serious pathogen of northern European forests. In a similar study,

 <italic>Hymenoscyphus fraxineus</italic>, a fungus from Asia causing the dieback of European ash, by monitoring its sporulation in a newly infested stand in Norway. Interactions with a competing nonpathogenic native fungus, 
 <italic>Hymenoscyphus albidus</italic>, were also investigated. The authors found that infection pressure was strongly influenced by summer temperatures (higher temperatures favor population growth) and that 
 <italic>H. fraxineus</italic> populations grew exponentially during years with favorable local conditions.
