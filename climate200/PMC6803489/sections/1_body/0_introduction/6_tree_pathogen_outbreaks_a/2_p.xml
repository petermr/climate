 <italic>Phytophthora</italic> on populations of two declining oak species (
 <italic>Quercus cerris</italic> and 
 <italic>Quercus pubescens</italic>) using comparisons with nearby nondeclining trees. The growth rate of both tree species decreased with drought and warming temperatures and was most pronounced in 
 <italic>Q. cerris</italic>. No effects of 
 <italic>Phytophthora</italic> on tree performance were identified, with the fungus being more prevalent in nondeclining trees.

 <italic>Tomicus</italic> shoot beetles, which often kill Yunnan pine trees in China. Their results show that all three blue-stain fungi (
 <italic>Leptographium wushanense</italic>, 
 <italic>Leptographium sinense</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ophiostoma canum</italic>) are potentially pathogenic to Yunnan pine, with 
 <italic>L. wushanense</italic> and 
 <italic>L. sinense</italic> more virulent than 
 <italic>O. canum</italic>. The authors stated that the two 
 <italic>Leptographium</italic> species may facilitate bark beetle colonization and contribute to their aggressiveness and, given sufficient spread, could cause significant damage to Yunnan pine forests across southwest China. Lastly,

These implications are likely to change and potentially be amplified under climate change as insect vectors invade new areas. The authors highlight how little we understand the effects of fungal pathogens in comparison to their insect vectors and outline gaps in knowledge to help advance this topic, including the need for baseline information of insect-fungal associations in their native ranges and for assessment of fungi roles in tree declines that are usually attributed to their more conspicuous insect vectors.
