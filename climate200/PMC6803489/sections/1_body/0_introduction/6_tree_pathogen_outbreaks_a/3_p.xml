<p>Overall, our understanding of the effects of climate change on forest pest and pathogen dynamics is in its infancy, with generalizations extremely difficult due to the huge amount of diversity in study systems and climate change effects across geographical regions. Forests are critical ecosystem components across many global regions, and a human capacity to predict and respond to pest and pathogen outbreaks in these habitats as environments continue to change is clearly required. We hope that the work presented in this Research Topic will help to both consolidate the field and motivate researchers to address the many gaps in knowledge.</p>
