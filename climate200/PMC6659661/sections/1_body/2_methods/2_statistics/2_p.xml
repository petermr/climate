<p id="Par13">The reconstructed SAT patterns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,d</xref> were created by the following procedures using d4PDF and JRA-55, respectively. First, regression patterns of JJA SAT against the time series of normalised scores were created for each PC mode (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>). We considered PC1 through PC3 because these modes account for one-third of the total variance in SAT. Second, weighting coefficients for the linear combination were computed for each PC mode. Assuming two matrices corresponding to the spatial distributions of decadal JJA SAT change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,c</xref>) and the regressed SAT pattern (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>), the weighting coefficient was obtained by the inner product of the two matrices. Thus, the weighting coefficient is proportional to the projection of the JJA SAT change pattern onto the eigenvector. The computed weighting factors for the first, second, and third PCs are 2.22, 1.04, and 1.51 for d4PDF, respectively, and 1.80, 1.36, and 0.71 for JRA-55, respectively. These weighting coefficients were chosen to most accurately reproduce the SAT patterns in d4PDF and JRA-55. Finally, the regression patterns from the first to the third modes were overlaid using the weighting coefficients. The same procedures were adopted using the same coefficients as above but for the regression patterns of snow water equivalent and soil moisture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and of geopotential height, wind field, and SAT (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, only PC2 and PC3 were overlaid by setting the coefficient of PC1 to zero, whereas in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, only PC1 was considered.
