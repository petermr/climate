<p id="Par5">How are the SAT variations on interannual and decadal timescales related? Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> displays the leading patterns of SAT differences on decadal timescales. Here, we conducted an EOF analysis for the SAT difference between 2000s and 1980s using 100 realisations derived from d4PDF. The wave train pattern appears to be the dominant mode of the summer SAT change on decadal timescales, which indicates decadal SAT and interannual SAT variations over northern Eurasia are closely related to each other. This generally agrees with earlier studies that pointed out the role of internal variability in multi-decadal trends

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the PC scores of decadal SAT change are remarkably different among the members. This suggests that although the wave train pattern of SAT is a dominant mode on the decadal timescale, its sign is very diverse among the ensemble members. Because ensemble members in d4PDF are all constrained by observed SST and sea ice, decadal variations of SST and sea ice are not the sufficient drivers for the decadal SAT change. Therefore, the inter-member diversity of SAT variations on decadal timescales are also likely attributable to atmosphere and land processes.
