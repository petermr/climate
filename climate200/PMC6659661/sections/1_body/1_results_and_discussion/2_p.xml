 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the successful decomposition of the recent SAT change into two components: one representing the effects of external forcing that robustly increase SAT irrespective of ensemble members, and the other representing the effects of internal dynamics that appear to fluctuate randomly on an interannual timescale. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> shows reconstructed SAT differences between the 2000s and 1980s computed from linear combinations of the first through third PC modes (Methods). The reconstructed SAT pattern resembles the reanalysis-based SAT change in that there are two areas of accelerated warming over the Eastern European Plain and Central Siberia and a region of negative SAT change over the Western Siberian Plain. This is a reasonable result because we used the optimised weighting coefficients for the linear combinations of the dominant PC modes. It is evident that the SAT increase around Mongolia has been underestimated, which is likely related to the absence of strong local feedback processes between soil moisture and the atmosphere

 </sup> in these leading modes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that wave train patterns, which fluctuate randomly, are essential for explaining the recent trend of summer SAT. Furthermore, the occurrence of recent extreme weather events in mid-latitude regions can be attributed to quasi-stationary wave propagation
