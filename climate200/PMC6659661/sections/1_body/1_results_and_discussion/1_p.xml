<p id="Par3">The three leading modes for the June–July–August (JJA)-averaged SAT over mid-to-high latitudes of Eurasia were computed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis applied to d4PDF data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Methods). Here, we use 6,000 snapshots of SAT derived from 100-member and 60-year-long data in the EOF analysis. The spatial pattern of the first principal component (PC1), which accounts for 14.67% of the total SAT variance, represents the continent-wide SAT increase with enhanced warming over western and northeastern Eurasia. The time series of the PC1 score shows accelerated warming after the early 1990s which is exhibited by all members. The interannual variation of the mean PC1 score is correlated strongly with northern hemispheric SAT (r = 0.91) and Arctic sea ice coverage (r = −0.80). Therefore, PC1 represents the response of Eurasian summer SAT to global climate change induced by external forcing and the resultant Arctic change, including SST increase and sea ice loss

 </sup> and increased water shortages in summer (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The second and third principal components (PC2 and PC3), which together account for 20.6% of the total SAT variance, show longitudinal striped patterns over northern Eurasia, similar to the SAT trend in the reanalysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The associated 500 hPa geopotential height fields indicate quasi-stationary wave propagation. The wave centres for PC2 and PC3 are shifted one-quarter phase. In contrast to PC1, interannual variations of the PC2 and PC3 scores appear to fluctuate irrespective of years, although weak increases in the PC2 score is recognised after the early 1990s. The random features of PC2 and PC3 indicate that the phase of wave propagation is determined independently of the prescribed SST variation; hence, the striped SAT pattern is likely attributable to internal dynamical processes of the coupled land–atmosphere system. The wave train patterns are also dominant when EOF analysis is applied to the detrended SAT by using JJA SAT deviation from the ensemble average (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Thus, mid-latitude wave propagation plays a central role in the internal variability of summer SAT. These results are in accordance with earlier analyses based on atmospheric GCM (AGCM) experiments that suggested that in middle latitudes the effects of the coupled land–atmosphere system on Eurasian SAT variability are as strong as the effects of SST

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with warming trends in PC1 and wave-train patterns in PC2 and PC3. The huge ensemble output is advantageous in separating the effects of external forcing and internal variability

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> confirms that the recent warming in Eurasian summers is result of external forcing, while the internal forcing is responsible for the heterogeneous warming.
