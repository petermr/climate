<p id="Par8">To link the analysis of the huge ensemble experiments with observations, we discuss recent observed changes in snow water. Although the reliability of past changes in snow-related variables over the entire Eurasian continent is controversial, there is observational evidence of recent change in the cryosphere around the Western Siberian Plain. Ground-based measurements have shown that snow depth increased since the 1990s

 </sup> and that spring snow cover has extended
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup> to around the upper Ob River basin. The number of blocking events and resultant cold events has been increasing over Central Asia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. These enhanced snow/cold events appear linked with the reduction of Arctic sea ice since around the late 1990s to 2000s, which modulates the internal dynamics of the atmosphere

 </sup>. It is probable that in recent years quasi-stationary waves have been anchored by positive snow and soil moisture anomalies over central northern Eurasia, which would explain why the summer SAT trend exhibits a tripole pattern. In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, time series of PC2 scores exhibits a weak positive shift after the early 1990s, implying that the sea ice reduction modulated the likelihood of a tripole pattern by increasing snowfall events due to enhanced moisture supply from the Arctic Ocean

 </sup>. A recent GCM study demonstrated that snow-fed wet land in spring lowers the summer SAT in the Ob and Volga river basins

 </sup>. Therefore, better prediction of summer SAT anomalies requires sophisticated land surface schemes capable of simulating the delayed discharge of snow water.
