<p>The intensification and expansion of vector-borne disease is likely to be a significant threat posed by climate change to human health [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mosquito vectors are of special concern due to the global morbidity and mortality from diseases like malaria and dengue fever, as well as the prominent public health crises caused by several recently-emergent viral diseases like West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika. The relationship between climate change and mosquito-borne disease is perhaps best studied, in both experimental and modeling work, for malaria and its associated 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors. While climate change could exacerbate the burden of malaria at local scales, more recent evidence challenges the “warmer-sicker world” expectation [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The optimal temperature for malaria transmission has recently been demonstrated to be much lower than previously expected [
