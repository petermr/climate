<p>Dengue has reemerged since the 1980s and is now one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide, following the end of decades of successful control of the

 <italic>aegypti</italic> vector [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of all 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases, dengue fever has been most frequently modeled in the context of climate change, and several models of the potential future of dengue have been published over the last two decades, with some limited work building consensus among them [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Models relating temperature to dengue vectorial capacity (the number of new infectious mosquito bites generated by one human case), and applying general circulation models (GCMs) to predict the impacts of climate change, date back to the late 1990s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A study from 2002 estimated that the population at risk (PAR) from dengue would rise from 1.5 billion in 1990 to 5–6 billion by 2085 as a result of climate change [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A more recent study added GDP per capita as a predictor in dengue distribution models, and found that climate change would increase the global dengue PAR by a much more moderate 0.28 billion by 2050 with GDP held constant compared to today [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Accounting for expected changes in global economic development using linked GDP-climate pathways further reduced the projected PAR by 0.12 billion over the same interval [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mechanistic models have shown that increases or decreases in dengue risk can be predicted for several sites on the same continent based on climate model and scenario selection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Most recently, a recent study prepared for the IPCC 1.5° report showed that limiting climate change to 1.5° could prevent 3.3 million dengue cases per year in the Americas compared to no intervention (+3.7°C) [
