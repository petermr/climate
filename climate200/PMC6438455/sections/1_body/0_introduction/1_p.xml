<p>Climate change will have a profound effect on the global distribution and burden of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current knowledge suggests that the range of mosquito-borne diseases could expand dramatically in response to climate change [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the physiological and epidemiological relationships between mosquito vectors and the environment are complex and often nonlinear, and experimental work has shown a corresponding nonlinear relationship between warming temperatures and disease transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, pathogens can be vectored by related species, which may be sympatric, or several pathogens may be transmitted by the same vector. Accurately forecasting the potential impacts of climate change on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne viruses—which include widespread threats like dengue and yellow fever, as well as several emerging threats like chikungunya, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis—thus becomes a key problem for public health preparedness [
