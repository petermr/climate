<p>Overall, our findings support the expectation that climate change will expand and increase 
 <italic>Aedes-</italic>borne viral transmission risk. However, we also find more nuanced patterns that differ among the mosquito species, climate pathways, localities, and time horizons. The largest increases in population at risk are consistently projected in Europe, with additional increases in high altitude regions in the tropics (eastern Africa and the northern Andes) and in the United States and Canada. These increases are expected not only for occasional exposure, but also for longer seasons of transmission, especially by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. However, in the tropics, for both mosquito species, and in other regions for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, more extreme climate pathways are expected to increase temperatures beyond the suitable range for transmission in many parts of the world. In addition to increases in total exposure from both mosquitoes in our study, we predict a global shift towards seasonal regimes of exposure from 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. This apparent paradox is due to the shifting geography of two slightly different sets of temperature bounds, as they also move across varying densities of human populations.
