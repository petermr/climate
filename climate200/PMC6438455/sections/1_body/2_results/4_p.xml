<p>For year-round exposure, net changes also increasingly differ over time between the two mosquito species. In 2050, warming temperatures lead to a net increase of roughly 100â€“200 million people in areas of year-round transmission potential for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>; in contrast, even in the least severe climate change scenarios, there are drastic net losses of year-round transmission potential for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, and these reductions are larger for more severe scenarios. These patterns continue into 2080 for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, with approximately 700 million fewer people than at present at risk for transmission in the most extreme warming scenarios: in RCP 8.5 by 2080, some parts of the tropics become so warm that even the warmer-adapted 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> will no longer be able to transmit viruses.
