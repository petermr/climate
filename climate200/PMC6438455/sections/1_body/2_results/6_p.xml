 <italic>aegypti</italic>, some of the largest net increases in people at risk are expected in southern Africa, with additional notable increases expected in Latin America. Although the upper thermal limit for transmission by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is very high (34.0Â°C), warming temperatures are projected to exceed the upper thermal limit for parts of the year in some cases; for example, the moderate RCP 4.5 pathway leads to the largest increases in people at risk of temperature suitability for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> transmission in southern Asia. Overall, almost 600 million people currently live in areas where temperatures are expected to become suitable for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> transmission year-round, though the net increase in year-round transmission will be much less (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, major net reductions are expected in south and southeast Asia, totaling more than 400 million people no longer at year-round risk with the most extreme warming, and additional reductions are expected in east Africa and Latin America. Only the southern part of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to experience net increases in year-round transmission risk (
