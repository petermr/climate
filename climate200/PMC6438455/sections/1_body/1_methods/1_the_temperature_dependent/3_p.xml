<p>Once we obtained our posterior samples for scaled 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> as a function of temperature we evaluated the probability that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0 (Prob(
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0)) at each temperature, giving a distinct curve for each mosquito species. We then defined a cutoff of Prob(
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0) = α to determine our posterior estimate of the probability that temperature is suitable for transmission; here, we use α = 0.975. This very high probability allows us to isolate a temperature window for which transmission is almost certainly not excluded; this is a conservative approach designed to minimize Type I error (inclusion of areas not suitable, and prevent overestimation of potential risk). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, these bounds are 21.3–34.0°C, and for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, 19.9–29.4°C. The prior study added an 8° daily temperature range and incorporated variation in transmission traits within a single day to derive daily average 
 <italic>R</italic>

 </sub> estimates, for the model validation component [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; in this study we used the main constant-temperature models derived in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as there is both limited empirical laboratory data on the vector-pathogen response to fine-scale variation, and projecting daily thermal range responses so far in the future would add much more uncertainty into our climate forecasts. Our maps of current risk therefore differ slightly from those presented in Fig 4 in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but are otherwise produced using the same methodology.
