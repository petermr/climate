 <caption> Evolution of frost occurrence (percentage points) for the summer season. Maps represent the difference between RCP and HIST simulations (averaged over period 1970–2000) for mid-century (period 2036–2065) and late century (2070–2100). Maps are multi-model averages for Tn and Tx and for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. </caption>
