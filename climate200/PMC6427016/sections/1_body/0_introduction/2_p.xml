 </sup> (see Supplementary Information) are appropriate tools to estimate the spatial variability of variables like air temperature, using spatial predictands derived from high-resolution digital elevation models, and large-scale temperature changes (predictors) taken from climate models. Here, we use a novel algorithm, allowing for more precise and refined temperature estimations

 </sup>, to regionalize climate change as simulated by a sample of 13 climate models (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) at a spatial resolution of 200 m. The two most contrasted greenhouse gas emission scenarios are selected, namely RCP2.6 (optimistic) and RCP8.5 (pessimistic), to consider the whole spread of possible climate evolutions, together with historical simulations conducted with observed concentrations of greenhouse gases since the 1850s. This downscaling procedure is necessary to consider the combined effects of elevation, slopes, orientation and valleys, on daily minimum (Tn) and maximum (Tx) air temperature. In the resulting elevation model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), the Mont-Blanc summit peaks at 4763 m instead of 4808 m in the real world, illustrating the high degree of realism reached by such hectometric resolution.
