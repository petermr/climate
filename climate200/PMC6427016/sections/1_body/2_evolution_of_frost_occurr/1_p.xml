<p id="Par6">Results are next refined at the daily timescale, through an analysis of daily frost occurrence, to represent the evolution in the summertime frost (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This is done under contrasted emission scenarios and for the mid- and late century, compared to current climate conditions (as described by historical simulations). Errors inherited from the CMIP5 are shown in Supplementary Figure 2, corresponding uncertainties in Supplementary Figure 3, and similar analyses applied to the winter season in Supplementary Figure 4. Projected changes are of larger magnitude for Tn, because most of the domains already experiences positive temperature in summer under current climate conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). They are much sensitive to the emission scenario, especially for the late century. Morning frost occurrence (Tn) decreases by about 25–30 pp over most of the Mont-Blanc massif in the mid-century under RCP8.5, and slightly less than that for the late century under RCP2.6. Frost occurrence experiences a huge drop of 45–50 pp for the late century for RCP8.5. The geography of these changes is strongly driven by the topography (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Crucially, even the Mont-Blanc summit shows obvious evolutions: up to −20 pp by the end of the century for frost occurrence in the morning (Tn), and even –35 pp in the afternoon (Tx), according to the RCP8.5 scenario. Such decrease may lead to major changes of its local climate. Under current climate conditions, it has only experienced brief thaw events
