<p id="Par4">We focus here on frost frequency evolutions, since this metric is of major importance for the rain-snow line, glacier melting or ice accumulation, the hydrology of the region and rock wall erosion though cryoclasty. Variability and long-term changes in frost frequency are thus accompanied by dramatic effects on the environment

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in the morning (Tn) during the winter season, the 0 °C threshold is almost never exceeded, except in the bottom of the lower valleys like Chamonix or Courmayeur (&lt;1200–1500 m). In the afternoon (Tx), the air mass warms and the occurrence of frost strongly decreases under 1500 and 2000 m asl. In summer frost is circumscribed to higher elevations, and frost predominates above 2500–3000 m asl for Tn and 3500–4000 m asl for Tx. These estimates (obtained as multiple regression based on observed temperature measurements
