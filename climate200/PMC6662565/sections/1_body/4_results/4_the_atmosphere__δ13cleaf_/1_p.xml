<p>There was a linear relationship between δ

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.61,

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.0059, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.38). Because Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> stayed constant, with simultaneous changes in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub>, we can determine that changing δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> with increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> was an effect of the changing isotopic composition of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub>) and was not related to [CO
 <sub>2</sub>].
