<p>This study implies constant carbon and nitrogen use and isotope fractionation relative to δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> by 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic>. Due to the unprecedentedly rapid changes δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> and [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] throughout Industrialization, this lack of change in carbon assimilation patterns, despite previous studies using modern δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values to reconstruct [CO
 <sub>2</sub>], may indicate that modern systems are not appropriate analogues for many periods of the geologic record during which climate evolved more slowly. Modern climate change may be too rapid for plants to adapt, though more research should be done to evaluate whether this response is replicable in other species, genera, and plant functional types. It is possible that the pace of anthropogenic climate change makes modern relationships inappropriate analogues for paleoclimate.
