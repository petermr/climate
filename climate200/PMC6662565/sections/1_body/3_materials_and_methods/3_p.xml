 <sub>leaf</sub> values combine δ
 <sup>13</sup>C values measured in this experiment on the CRDS with δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values measured on the IRMS at INSTAAR, we did not have access to individual errors for δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> and could not propagate the error. Therefore, we used our reproducibility error of 0.3‰, which is larger than the expected error for the IRMS (0.1‰), to be conservative.
