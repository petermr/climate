<p>To test whether other climate variables confounded the relationship between δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> and δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub>, we calculated carbon isotope fractionation values (Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub>) for each specimen using known yearly δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn-1">Eq. (1)</xref>). We derived global δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> values from direct (
 <xref rid="ref-82" ref-type="bibr">Rubino et al., 2013</xref>) and interpolated ice and firn core measurements according to the year of sampling (
 <xref rid="ref-101" ref-type="bibr">White, Vaughn &amp; Michel, 2015</xref>). This does not account for ecosystem or microbiome-level deviations in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub>, but does account for the greater source isotopic value. Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values made it possible to de-couple the human-driven relationship between increased [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] and decreased δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values (the Suess Effect; 
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Keeling, 1979</xref>) because they were calculated by isolating leaf isotope ratios from the atmospheric isotopic signal.
