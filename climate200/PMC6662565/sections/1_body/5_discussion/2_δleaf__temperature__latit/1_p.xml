<p>There were a number of climate variables that we did not expect to have a correlative relationship with Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub>, but we addressed to ensure that they were not confounding variables (MAT, maximum summer temperature, latitude, seasonality). Due to the consistent internal temperature and lack of relationship between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> to MAT in previous studies, we expected no relationship between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> and MAT nor maximum summer temperature. As we expected, MAT showed no significant relationship with Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values neither in meta-analyses, growth chamber experiments (
