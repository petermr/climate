<p>Herbarium specimens are a useful way to look in high-resolution on this time scale, but were not necessarily consistently sampled between expeditions and years. Thus some factors such as maturity and height of tree, which have been shown to relate to carbon isotope discrimination (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Brienen et al., 2017</xref>), are not specifically accounted for here. However, 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Brienen et al. (2017)</xref> found that height was not a significant factor in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of the gymnosperm used (
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), in contrast to broadleaf species (
 <italic>Quercus robur</italic>, 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Cedrela odorata</italic>) where there was an influence. Additionally, regional variations in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> resulting from proximity to respiring soil could provide a different baseline δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub> value than the global one used based upon Mauna Loa Observatory’s gas samples (
 <xref rid="ref-99" ref-type="bibr">Wehr &amp; Saleska, 2015</xref>). While we were unable to control exactly where on the tree each sample was taken from nor the ecosystem-specific parameters that might influence δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>atm</sub>, each herbarium record includes notes on the sampling location, often including approximate maturity of the tree and height sampled from. Additionally, as expeditions are done without heavy machinery, it is likely that our specimens were sampled from approximately the height of a human, which is well out of the range of isotopic influence from soil respired CO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Bazzaz &amp; Williams, 1991</xref>). Finally, differences in δ
 <sup>13</sup>C
 <sub>leaf</sub> values differ depending on where on the leaf isotopes are sampled from (
 <xref rid="ref-111" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). We controlled for this effect by homogenizing several entire leaves per sample and running duplicate isotope analyses, which all came within machine error (0.3‰) of one another.
