<p>These FACE experiments also showed that when run over longer time scales, trees reached a point of CO
 <sub>2</sub> acclimation and stopped increased carbon assimilation under enhanced CO
 <sub>2</sub>; thus, predicted shifts in tree C-uptake may be short-lived, a pattern that will be inevitably discernable in a long-term study incorporating pre-Industrial leaf tissues through the present (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Nowak, Ellsworth &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>). Based on FACE experiments, we expected %C to have increased in leaves sampled from the early 1800s to the present, though we might see the rate of increase slow with time. However, we saw no relationship between %C, nor C:N ratios and time nor increase in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>].
