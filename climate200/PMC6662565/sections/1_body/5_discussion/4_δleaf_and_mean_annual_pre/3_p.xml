<p>Another explanation is that MAP is not an appropriate metric for measuring plant-available water, and while Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> is still a measure of water use efficiency and this value is dynamic over conditions, snowmelt volumes and/or soil water—as driven by soil porosity and other factors—are better indicators of plant-available water. Further investigations using these variables will better constrain which water-related variables affect Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of leaf tissues. The weak R
 <sup>2</sup> value between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> and MAP (0.0138) means that Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> cannot be used to reconstruct paleo-MAP using the relationship determined by 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Diefendorf et al. (2010)</xref>. Additional single-species experiments, particularly within angiosperms, should be conducted to look for correlations between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> and MAP to test whether the lack of relationship is due to a difference inherent to gymnosperms.
