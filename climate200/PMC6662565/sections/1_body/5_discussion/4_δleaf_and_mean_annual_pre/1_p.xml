<p>When Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> were compared with MAP, 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Diefendorf et al.’s (2010)</xref> previously established relationship did not hold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>), especially in low precipitation regimes (&lt;1,000 mm yr
 <sup>−1</sup>) where the change in Diefendorf et al.’s Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values was most sensitive to changes in MAP. One explanation for the lack of relationship between Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> and MAP is that this relationship breaks down on the single-species, or even plant functional type, level. In the aforementioned meta-analyses, plant functional type, species, and region were not controlled. Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values may be inherent to specific biomes but may not be representative of a general trend of any given plant or plant type to MAP. It is possible that the relationships seen in the meta-analyses by 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Diefendorf et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Kohn (2010)</xref> instead represent an array of taxon-specific constant isotopic values that collectively show a meta-relationship. This experiment could be further explored by performing the same experiment in natural settings across different biomes and different plant functional types. Assuming that Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values are indicative of water use (

 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Farquhar, Ehleringer &amp; Hubick, 1989</xref>), this lack of relationship may also mean that plants with specific water use efficiencies and representative Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values are generally located in areas where they are not living in conditions that are stressed for water given their evolutionary adaptations. Geologically, this could mean that the presence of a particular taxon in fossil localities could provide a quantitative estimate for range of MAP, which could allow more specificity of paleoclimate regimes based on macrofossils (Nearest Living Relative and/Coexistence Approach;

 <sub>3</sub> plants may not respond to regional changes as previously thought. This is of particular concern because the velocity of climate change, especially for continued high emission rate scenarios, is substantially faster than trees will be able to adapt to (
