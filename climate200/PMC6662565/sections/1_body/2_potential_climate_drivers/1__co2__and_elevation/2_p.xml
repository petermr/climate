<p>Elevation has been shown to factor into carbon isotope discrimination but is frequently not evaluated independently, due to its covariant relationship with climate variables such as temperature, vapor pressure, partial pressure of CO
 <sub>2</sub> (

 <sub>2</sub>), soil [CO
 <sub>2</sub>], and soil texture (

 <italic>Salix herbacea</italic> leaves along an altitudinal gradient (2,000–2,800 m) in Austria showed a decrease in carbon isotope value with increased altitude, did not account for corresponding changes in other climate variables (

 <xref rid="ref-98" ref-type="bibr">Van de Water, Leavitt &amp; Betancourt, 2002</xref>). In 2010, a meta-analysis assessing carbon isotope fractionation and discrimination values across a wide range of C
 <sub>3</sub> plants (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Diefendorf et al., 2010</xref>) found that when combined with MAP, elevation explained 61% of variability in Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values. Based upon these studies, we included elevation as a potential variable in our study, however, we chose sample locations to minimize changes in elevation because it is difficult to completely separate this variable from regional variation in [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] and δ
