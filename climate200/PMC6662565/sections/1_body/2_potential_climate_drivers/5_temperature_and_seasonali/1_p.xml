<p>In addition to the climate variables with pre-established and applied relationships with Δ
 <sub>leaf</sub> values ([CO
 <sub>2</sub>], MAP), various hypotheses have been proposed about the relationships between carbon isotope discrimination and other climate variables. For example, MAT could also constrain photosynthetic processes and associated carbon isotope fractionation because it gives a rough representation of extreme conditions and growing season length during which carbon assimilation occurs. For this reason, MAT is a well-addressed climate variable in previous isotope fractionation studies, but none have identified a relationship between fractionation and MAT (

In addition to MAT, maximum summer temperatures (particularly, the extreme highs associated with a warming climate) are expected to increase (
