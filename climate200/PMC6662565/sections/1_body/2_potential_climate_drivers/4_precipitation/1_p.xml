<p>The stomata act as an inlet for CO
 <sub>2</sub> uptake as well as an outlet for leaf water loss via transpiration, which is why one might expect a relationship between carbon isotope fractionation and available water (represented in the paleo-record as reconstructed MAP). With decreased available water (i.e., decreased MAP) comes increased need for plant “water use efficiency” (as measured by the ratio of water used in photosynthesis to water lost through transpiration); plants therefore minimize water loss through the same stomata by fully closing, resulting in decreased carbon isotope fractionation (
