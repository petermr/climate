<p>Here, we study the multi‐decadal phenology of four distinct coastal marsh systems to gain insights into their ability to uptake carbon in relation to climate change at a broad scale (Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). We use the longest continuous satellite‐based record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat Climatic Data Records (CDRs) and an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model, to reconstruct the phenology between 1984 and 2014 for the different coastal marsh systems in Louisiana, USA, one of world's largest coastal marsh habitats that share the same climatic stressors as many other coastal ecosystems around the world. We speculate that climate change (i.e., temperature, sea‐level, and atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations) has influenced the phenology of the marshes at the ecosystem level and that the influence is a function of whether the marshes are tidal freshwater, intermediate, brackish, or saline systems. We also hypothesize that the climatic influences will continue, if not increase, under future climate scenarios.
