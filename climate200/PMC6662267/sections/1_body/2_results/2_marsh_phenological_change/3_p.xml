<p>The local sea‐level, temperature, and CO
 <sub>2</sub> all rose from 1984 to 2014 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">A1</xref>). The phenology of the different systems varied in response to the climate conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35215-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">A4</xref>). The peak NDVI values of all four marsh systems did not significantly change over time. The peak NDVI day of the saline marshes showed no significant changes over time but correlated with air temperature (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes significantly increased (by 36.4 and 38.0%, respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in both cases), and positively correlated with variations in the atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.4 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 in both cases).
