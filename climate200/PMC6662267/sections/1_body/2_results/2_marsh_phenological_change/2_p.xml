<p>The NDVI‐derived phenological records of the freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marsh systems from 1984 to 2014 are well‐described by our models (pseudo‐

 <xref rid="ece35215-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Exceptions are years when not enough relatively cloudless images were collected, and thus the phenological parameters of the respective marsh units in those years cannot be estimated: that is, all marshes in 1990, 1991, 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2012 and the saline marshes in 1994 and 1998. The phenology of the different marsh systems varies. The freshwater marshes had the highest annual peak NDVI (around 0.7), followed by the intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes (around 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4, respectively; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The NDVI of the freshwater, intermediate, and brackish marshes peaked between July and August, while the NDVI of the saline marshes peaked between July and October (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The length of the growing seasons of the freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes varied between 2 and 8 months among different marsh systems and years (Figure
