<p>Indeed, the linear models used in this study are highly simplified. These models do not consider other environmental factors, such as water temperature and nutrient availability, which can vary substantially with in situ conditions, or the nonlinear effects and the interactions among the different factors. For instance, the enhancement of CO
 <sub>2</sub> uptake by C3 plants may be eventually slowed down by photosynthetic downregulation, nutrient limitations, or increased disturbance from sea‐level rise, thus the CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization on the marshes will not continue over long time frames as decades (Erickson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In addition, the marshes may suffer from other stresses such as pests, herbivores, and pathogens that can also be intensified by a warmer climate (Van der Putten, Macel, &amp; Visser, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, this study provides a “baseline” scenario for future marsh phenology with unconstrained sole impacts from temperature or CO
 <sub>2</sub>, as well as observational inputs for more advanced modeling studies.
