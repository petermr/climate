<p>Couvillion et al. reported that 25% of Louisiana's coastal marshes that existed in 1932 had been lost by 2010 (Couvillion et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), and this study shows that 20% of the marshes in 1988 were lost by 2013. These findings document a highly vulnerable ecosystem. Recent studies have found strong correlations between marsh area loss and several climatic variables (Turner, Kearney, &amp; Parkinson, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Turner, Baustian, Swenson, &amp; Spicer, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Kearney &amp; Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). In this study, we further the research by separating the area changes of different marsh systems. We find that the areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were quite stable; while the area of the brackish and saline marshes decreased significantly and were negatively correlated with sea‐level and CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration. Indeed, the area changes of the Louisiana coastal marshes are likely to relate with both climatic and anthropogenic factors, but here we focus on the climatic factors.
