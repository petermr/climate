<p>The area changes of the different marsh systems vary spatially. We find an expansion of brackish marshes into intermediate and saline marshes in the Terrebonne Basin, while saline marshes were replaced by intermediate marshes in the Barataria Basin, and brackish marshes were replaced by intermediate and freshwater marshes in the Breton Sound Basin. This study focuses on the temporal changes of the environmental factors over the past decades and only considers the sea‐level and salinity information of one station within the study area. Future studies further examine the spatial pattern of the sea‐level and salinity changes (Jankowski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), the relative relationship between sediment supply and sea‐level rise of different locations (Mariotti &amp; Fagherazzi, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), and the availability of accommodation space (Schuerch et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) may provide more insights the spatial patterns of the area changes.
