<p>We use the longest continuous satellite record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat CDRs from 1984 to 2014, to create the phenological records of the marshes (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35215-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">A1</xref>). The data are collected by three Landsat series satellites: (a) the Landsat 5 equipped with the Thematic Mapper (TM) that launched in 1984 and decommissioned in 2011; (b) the Landsat 7 equipped with the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that launched in 1999; and (c) the Landsat 8 equipped with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) that launched in 2013. All three sensors have a 30‐m spatial resolution and a 16‐day temporal revisit cycle. The study area locates within the Landsat scenes of Path 22 Row 40 and Path 22 Row 39. There are 359 relatively cloudless images (mosaics of the two Landsat scenes) used for the phenology modeling.
