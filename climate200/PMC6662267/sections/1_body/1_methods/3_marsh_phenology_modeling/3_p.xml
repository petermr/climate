<p>The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values are calculated as a proxy for the marshes' aboveground biomass (

 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and the NDVI‐based phenological records of the marshes are modeled using an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model (Mo, Momen, &amp; Kearney, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). This method is developed by Mo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) to provide a rigorous statistical analysis for phenological curves of different vegetation that are represented by nonlinear functions with repeated‐measure variables. Phenological measurements (i.e., the NDVI) made on the same observational units (i.e., marsh systems) over time are treated as repeated measurements. The phenological records of the different marsh systems are fitted into three nonlinear models, the Gaussian, the stepwise Gaussian, and the stepwise logistic functions. The goodness‐of‐fit of the models is assessed via the Efron's pseudo

 <sup>2</sup> and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Akaike Information Criterion Correction (AICC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The pseudo 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, a statistic similar to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> in the linear regression, indicates the percent variance explained by the nonlinear models (Hardin, Hilbe, &amp; Hilbe, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The pseudo 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ranges from −∞ to 1. A pseudo 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> closer to 1 indicates more variability in the data is explained. The AIC, AICC, and BIC indices evaluate models based on the principle of parsimony, that is, a model explains more variation in the data with fewer variables is considered a better fit (Boyce, Vernier, Nielsen, &amp; Schmiegelow, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Richards, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Key phenological parameters, that is, peak NDVI, peak NDVI day, and growing season length (bracketing days that had NDVI &gt;90% of peak NDVI) for each marsh system in each year are estimated from the best‐fit model. The phenology modeling only considered existing marshes, that is, it is corrected for the marsh area changes over the 30 years.
