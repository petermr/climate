<p>The study area is in four major basins in Louisiana, USA, at the northern Gulf of Mexico: the Barataria, Breton Sound, Pontchartrain, and Terrebonne basins (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35215-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The marshes are classified into freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline systems based on vegetation association and salinity (Gosselink, 
 <xref rid="ece35215-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">1984</xref>). Freshwater marshes occupy habitats with a salinity &lt;0.5 ppt and are dominated by 
 <italic>Panicum hemitomon</italic>,
 <italic> Sagittaria falcata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eleocharis</italic> sp. Intermediate marshes occupy habitats with salinity from 0.5 to 5 ppt and are dominated by 
 <italic>Spartina patens</italic> and 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>. Brackish marshes are characterized by salinities ranging from 5 to 18 ppt, and the dominant species are 
 <italic>Spartina patens</italic> and 
 <italic>Distichlis spicata</italic>. Saline marshes occur where salinity is &gt;18 ppt, and the dominant species are 
 <italic>Spartina alterniflora</italic>,
 <italic> Distichlis spicata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Juncus roemerianus</italic>. The percentage of C4 plants increases with higher salinities, whereas the species richness and diversity decrease. The boundaries of the different marshes are obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) vegetative survey for Louisiana coastal marshes (Chabreck &amp; Linscombe,
