 <caption> Historical (1984‚Äê2014) and predicted marsh phenology (till 2050) under future temperature and CO 2 projections. The future air temperature in the study area is predicted using a linear model based on the air temperature from the National Weather Service New Orleans airport station, Louisiana, USA, since the 1940s. The future atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are estimations from two carbon cycle models (i.e., the Bern model, or BERN, and the Integrated Science Assessment Model, or ISAM) under the different emission scenarios reported in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report ( IPCC AR4) </caption>
