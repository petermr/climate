 <caption> Potential epidemic risks of KBB in areas of Jeonnam province suitable for kiwifruit cultivation under the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario for each 10-y period from the historical (2000–2009) to the future (2020–2029–2040–2049, 2060–2069, and 2080–2089) periods. The frequencies of severe epidemics for each 10-year period were calculated based on the simulation results of the Pss-KBB Risk Model, with disease severity greater than 20% per year considered to be a severe epidemic. (A) Spatio-temporal trend of the KBB epidemics shown on the map of Jeonnam province. Note that the light gray areas on the map indicate the “Not suitable” areas for kiwifruit cultivation in each decadal period, which were not subject to the simulation of KBB epidemics. (B) Comparison of the mean KBB severe epidemics on 7 Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) station locations in Jeonnam province (stars in Fig. 1), simulated with the Korea Meteorological Administration 1 km scenario (solid line), the observed weather data of the 7 ASOS stations only for 2000–2009 (round dot), or the downscaled scenarios of 11 GCMs (dotted line with gray shared area). Note that the dotted line indicates the mean of the simulated KBB severe epidemics from 11 GCMs, and the gray shared area indicates the range of ± 1 SD from the mean. Pss, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae; KBB, kiwifruit bacterial blossom blight. </caption>
