  <p>Predicted changes in severe epidemics of kiwifruit blossom blight (KBB risk) and flowering dates in Jeonnam province from the 2000s to the 2090s under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario. The decadal changes of the KBB risk (black line) and the flowering date (black dotted line) for kiwifruit cultivar Hayward were compared with those of the KBB risk (gray line) and the flowering date (gray dotted line) of the kiwifruit cultivar Haegeum for the same periods (2000s–2090s). The bottom graph indicates the decadal changes of average values of temperature (°C) and rainfall frequency (days) during the 10-day periods before full bloom of Hayward (black graphs) and Haegeum (gray graphs) cultivars.</p>
