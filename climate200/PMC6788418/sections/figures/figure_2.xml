  <p>Integrated modeling workflow using three models in the study. First, the Climate Suitability Model generates suitable areas for kiwifruit cultivation. Then, the Chill-day Model simulates flowering period of kiwifruit vines only on the suitable areas in Jeonnam province identified by the Climate Suitability Model. Lastly, the Pss-KBB Risk Model simulates potential epidemic risks of KBB using the flowering dates generated by the Chill-day Model as an input. Pss,
