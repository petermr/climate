<p>Potential changes to the climatic suitability maps for kiwifruit cultivation in Jeonnam province were determined based on climatic conditions in each 1-km-grid of the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario (
 <xref rid="f3-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Three suitability zones (Not suitable, Suitable, and Highly suitable) for optimal kiwifruit cultivation were displayed depending on expected temporal changes in the climate of Jeonnam province, from the historic period (2000–2009) to future periods (2020–2029–2040–2049, 2060–2069, and 2080–2089). The simulated suitable areas for the historic period were comparable to the current kiwifruit cultivation areas in the province (Statistics Korea, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kosis.kr" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://kosis.kr</ext-link>), except for the Gwangju Metropolitan City area, probably due to warmer temperatures from an urban heat island effect. This result indicates that the climatic conditions used in this study represent real-world conditions today. The geographical locations suitable for kiwifruit cultivation expanded from the present coastal area to the high elevation inland area, and also northward, by 2090. Approximately one-third of the areas in Jeonnam province were shown as ‘Not suitable’ for kiwifruit cultivation at present, but almost 99% of the areas changed to ‘Highly suitable’ in the 2080s, supporting our understanding that this local impact assessment for the province is reasonable.
