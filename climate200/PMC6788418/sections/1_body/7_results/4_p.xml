<p>Since the results in 
 <xref rid="f5-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> do not show uncertainty information derived from the uncertainty in climate projections from different GCMs, we examined whether the KBB risks simulated with the KMA scenario are accommodated within the range of uncertainty from the multiple scenarios of 11 GCMs (
 <xref rid="f5-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In most periods examined, the KBB risks from the KMA scenario were within the range of the mean Â± 1 SD of the risks from the 11 GCM scenarios, and the mean KBB risks of the KMA scenario followed the temporal fluctuation of the mean KBB risks from 11 GCMs. This particular example indicates the spatio-temporal trend of KBB risks obtained from the KMA scenario may not present significantly biased results beyond the climate change signals from other GCMs.
