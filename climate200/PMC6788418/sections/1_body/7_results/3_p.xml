<p>Kiwifruit becomes vulnerable to KBB infection during the flowering period. We first used the Chill-day Model to determine the flowering dates of kiwifruit using the climate change scenario. Disease severities of KBB during the simulated flowering periods were calculated using the Pss-KBB Risk Model. The resulting KBB risks (the number of severe epidemics with more than 20% disease severity) were considered as the potential epidemic risks of KBB under climate change. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f5-ppj-35-459" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, few areas were predicted to have more than three to four severe epidemics over the historical period (2000–2009), especially in the major kiwifruit growing counties in Jeonnam province. This is in line with the fact that there have rarely been severe epidemics of KBB with significant production losses in the province over the last years (Jeonnam Agricultural Research Center, personal communication). Towards 2090, KBB risks did not show a clear or uniform pattern of spatial change, indicating some complex, location-specific interactions between kiwifruit phenology and the corresponding KBB simulations. Geographically, a greater number of severe epidemics started in the coastal island areas, such as Jindo, Haenam, Wando, Goheung, and Yeosu, and the risk expanded into southeastern inland areas of the province in 2060–2069, while in most areas, except for some parts of Wando, Jangheung, and Suncheon, no severe epidemics were predicted for the period 2080–2089.
