<p>In this study, we successfully evaluated the effects of climate change by leveraging multiple models in an integrated way, by conducting a series of modeling studies on the responses of kiwifruit and KBB bacterial pathogen to climatic conditions. The integrated modeling approach consists of a climate suitability model simulating the suitable area for kiwifruit cultivation (the Climate Suitability Model), a kiwifruit phenology model (the Chill-day Model) simulating the flowering stage when KBB occurs, and a KBB epidemiological model (the Pss-KBB Risk Model) simulating disease infection processes (

All three models were simulated using the same KMA 1 km resolution, RCP8.5 climate change scenario, resulting in synchronous biophysical interactions between plants, microbial pathogens, and environmental conditions in each 1-km-grid location in Jeonnam province. Although there remains a significant challenge of not being able to account for all complicated factors affecting the biophysical interactions that might change in future, the resulting KBB risk represents more realistic information with fewer assumption compared to previous studies (
