<p>Our study showed that Haegeum, a gold-flesh kiwifruit that normally blooms about 2 weeks earlier than Hayward, is expected to carry significantly lower KBB risks than Hayward, especially in the 2050sâ€“2070s when Hayward was predicted to face the highest KBB pressures. Based on this finding, we suggest that other kiwifruit cultivars with a different maturity such as Haegeum can be an alternative solution to cope with future KBB risks. The feasibility of replacing the major cultivar Hayward with the Haegeum can be supported by a simple economic analysis utilizing currently available information on agrochemical-based KBB control practices and the market price of Hayward and Haegeum kiwifruits.

(2004)</xref> suggested that the optimum spray program of preventive bactericides for the control of KBB is three consecutive applications at 10-day intervals, starting in early May during the flowering season of kiwifruits. Based on the survey by

 <xref rid="b42-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Shin et al., 2004</xref>) for Hayward and Haegeum are 8,250 KRW and 4,620 KRW per unit area, respectively, with the assumption that kiwifruit growers spray only when severe epidemics (more than 20% disease severity) are expected. Furthermore, the market price of Haegeum is twice that of Hayward as of 2015 (

However, there is a risk in changing cultivars: during the first 5 years, growers will obtain no income from newly planted Haegeum vines, because it generally takes 5 years for a new kiwifruit vine to reach an average level of kiwifruit production. Nevertheless, the overall income of the growers can be sustained given the above-mentioned advantages of lower agro-chemical spray costs and higher market price of Haegeum compared to Hayward. With this kind of economic evaluation against scientifically-informed adaptation strategies to address the predicted KBB risks, it becomes highly plausible for local government units to proactively implement these strategies, unless other matters, such as consumer preferences that influence market price and pest and disease concerns, conflict with these strategies.
