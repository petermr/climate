<p>To facilitate these planning measures, we predicted future epidemics of KBB in Jeonnam province as a case study for local impact assessments of climate change. However, in most impact studies, variables other than climate are generally assumed to remain unchanged in the future. Such assumptions, and the uncertainties inherent in climate change scenarios themselves, often result in unrealistic predicted impacts of climate change, which prevents local policymakers or stakeholders from being convinced by the results. Therefore, there is a strong need for an integrated modeling approach to incorporate a greater quantity of the factors that would play critical roles in a real situation. In fact, there have been many impact assessments using the integrated modeling approach in various sectors, where multiple models and/or algorithms were used together to determine critical interaction points between multiple socio-economic, biological, and environmental components (
