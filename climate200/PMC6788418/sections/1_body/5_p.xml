<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of climate change and the corresponding adaptation strategies by leveraging multiple models in an integrated way. To achieve this objective, we conducted modeling studies investigating the responses to climatic conditions of kiwifruit and of the pathogenic bacteria that cause KBB, using the high-resolution RCP 8.5 climate change scenario. This included (1) simulating suitable areas for kiwifruit cultivation using a climate suitability model, and (2) linking a kiwifruit phenology model with a disease epidemiological model to predict the future epidemic risk of KBB. Finally, we suggest, based on this integrated modeling solution, a potential, scientifically-informed, long-term adaptation strategy of using a cultivar of kiwifruit with a different maturity period to avoid future pressures from KBB. To our knowledge, this is the first local impact assessment and adaptation study of plant disease risks under climate change linking both the host plant phenology model and the disease epidemiological model, with consideration of future climatic suitability for the host plant.</p>
