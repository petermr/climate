<p>The RCP 8.5, the highest greenhouse gas emission pathway in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), was selected in the study to provide a baseline to reflect the continuously increasing trend of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in the face of limited global/national policy intervention (
