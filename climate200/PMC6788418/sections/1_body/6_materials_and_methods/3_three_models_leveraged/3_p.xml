<p>The original Pss-KBB Risk Model estimates a risk score for KBB using daily minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation data for the 10 days preceding the full bloom date, which was highly correlated with the observed disease severity data (correlation coefficient [CC] of 0.954 with 1% significance level). To simulate disease severity (%) using the Pss-KBB Risk Model, we developed an additional algorithm based on the model: a regression equation between the simulated risk scores and the corresponding observed severity data, using the lm() function of the R statistical program (version 3.3.2) (

 <xref rid="b26-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al. (2001)</xref>. The Haenam data range from 0.1% to 10.7%, while the Goheung data range from 20.7% to 35.3% representing severe epidemic situation. Weather data from the KMA ASOS stations in Haenam (261) and Goheung (262) near the kiwifruit orchards were used to run the Pss-KBB Risk Model and to generate the simulated risk scores. The resulting regression equation was validated by comparing the simulated disease severities with another set of ground-truth data collected in 2015 in multiple kiwifruit orchards. Weather data from the nearest KMA weather stations were used to simulate the Pss-KBB Risk Model.
