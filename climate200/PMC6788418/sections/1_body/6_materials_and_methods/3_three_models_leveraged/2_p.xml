<p>To predict the potential epidemic risk of KBB under a changing climate, we leveraged the Pss-KBB Risk Model developed in our recent study (

 <xref rid="b21-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2015b)</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="b19-ppj-35-459" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2016)</xref> to estimate the flowering date for the kiwifruit cultivars, Hayward and Haegeum, in Korea. In all previous studies, this model was validated on datasets from different sites in Jeonnam province, which yielded smaller prediction errors than using climatologically averaged flowering dates in each site. This suggested its reliability when applied to climate change scenarios. Daily minimum and maximum temperature data are used for the simulation of the Chill-day Model. This model was adopted in our study to predict the flowering period, which subsequently defines the simulation dates of the Pss-KBB Risk Model.
