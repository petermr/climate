<p>The KBB risks over the province were represented as the frequency of severe epidemics over each 10-year-period, with a maximum of 10 severe epidemics over each period. Considering the general flower pruning practices taking place in kiwifruit orchards, where at least 20% of flowers are pruned (Jeonnam Agricultural Research Center, personal communication), severe epidemic risk was recorded when the simulated KBB severity exceeded 20% in a given year. Simulation results were divided into five periods, starting at the historical period (2000–2009) and covering future periods of every other decade, such as 2020–2029, 2040–2049, 2060–2069, and 2080–2089. These results were presented on the map to show temporal (present to future) and spatial changes of KBB risk throughout the province. To compare this result with the ones from multiple scenarios of 11 GCMs, the same modeling procedures using the Chill-day Model and the Pss-KBB Risk Model were repeated with multiple scenario data downscaled to the 7 ASOS locations. The range of uncertainty in estimating the KBB risks resulting from the uncertainty in climate projections from different GCMs was displayed with the mean and the range of ± 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean, which was directly compared with the mean KBB risks simulated on the 7 ASOS locations using the KMA scenario.</p>
