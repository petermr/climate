<p>The SDMs were estimated by running two different algorithms within the biomod2 package on R [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]: generalised linear models (GLM [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and maximum entropy (Maxent [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). We generated three sets of pseudo-absence data containing ten times the number of presence data points randomly distributed for each species [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The data sets were then partitioned so that 80% were used to calibrate the models, while the remaining 20% were used for the evaluation. Model performance was assessed with the True Skill Statistics (TSS; threshold-dependent [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]) and the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (ROC; threshold-independent [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), this procedure was repeated ten times for cross-validation, and the models with poor performance (TSS&lt;0.5) were eliminated from the ensemble process. We also report sensitivity (percentage of true positives), specificity (percentage of true negatives) and assessed the predictor variable importance using the tables of permutation importance.
