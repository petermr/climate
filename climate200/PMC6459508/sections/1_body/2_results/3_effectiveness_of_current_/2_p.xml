<p>Our analyses suggest that the majority of the northern and western parts of the focal area are climatically stable suitable habitats for FT species, indicating that suitable habitats coincided with six to seven of the seven scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Climatically stable grid cells which were considered suitable habitats for at least 20% of each trophic guild correspond to 297,500 km
 <sup>2</sup>. Nearly half of this area is within PAs (164,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> [55%]), yet another significant part has native vegetation but unprotected (88,100 km
 <sup>2</sup> [30%]) or overlaps with degraded areas (45,400 km
 <sup>2</sup> [15%]; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215229.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Also, there is a drastic reduction in the stable area when considering a higher proportion of each trophic guild per grid cell, for instance, climatically stable cells that were considered suitable habitats for at least 30% of each trophic guild correspond to only 73,400 km
 <sup>2</sup> (a decrease of about 75%) and there is no single cell that maintains at least 50% of each guild in most scenarios (
