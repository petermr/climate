<p>According to our results, the majority of species were projected to show a range loss. In addition, in terms of trends in mean area change per trophic guild, the FT species presented a decrease in the mean projected area under all future scenarios, resulting in a progressive range retraction through time. It is worth pointing out the range expansion in some FT species that exceed in more the 100%. This could be due to the fact that SE Amazonia represents the distribution margin of some FT species and may not express its climatic affinities precisely [

However, it is also likely that other factors besides climate, such as those related to species ecological characteristics, could play a role in the distribution ranges. Therefore, finer resolution models and/or the inclusion of species-specific environmental factors may be needed to address these issues. Conversely, the OAV species presented an overall trend to increase progressively their distributional range. We hypothesized that FT species would have the greatest impact, and likely, climate change would favour OAV species, based on the expected "savannization" process [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Our models partially corroborate this idea, showing an increase in mean area of OAV species, except for OAVFR species. Based on our models, frugivores seem to be the most sensitive functional group (FTFR mean area loss ranging between 18.2% [2050; RCP 2.6] and 51% [2070; RCP 8.5], and OAVFR ranging between 9.7% [2050; RCP 6.0] and 32.8% [2070; RCP 6.0]) for the study area as a whole.
