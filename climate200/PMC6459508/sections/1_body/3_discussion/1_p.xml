<p>Climate change will impact the biodiversity across the globe [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and it is important to forecast the effects not only on range shifts but also on the functionalities [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Through our SDMs we show that avian assemblage from SE Amazonia will be potentially strongly affected by climate change in the near future, even under the most optimistic scenario. As expected, species occupying different habitats will respond differently, but invariably frugivores will be more negatively affected. Considering only FT species, currently, the centre and western portion of SE Amazonia are potentially the richest areas, and future projections suggest a northern shift with an expressive depletion in SR. The OAV species have a disjunct distribution, where the occurrence core is in the “dry diagonal” (out of the scope of this work) and isolated patches of the Amazonia [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As our study system includes a transition zone encompassing both environments (FT and OAV), the OAV species occur naturally at low numbers (&lt;30% in almost all areas) but potentially could reach 46% east of Marajó Island and 59% in patches at the central and northwestern portion of the focal area based on our current projections. Under the future scenarios, potential SR was predicted to increase due to a northward shift (from the core region, not shown) that becomes uniform along all of the focal area, maintaining its maximum value (~55%) at the northwestern portion.
