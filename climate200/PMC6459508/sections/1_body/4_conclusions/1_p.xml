<p>Throughout our habitat suitability models, we show that (1) birds in SE Amazonia will be affected by climate change even under the most optimistic scenario; (2) frugivores are the most sensitive group facing climate change in coming decades which could bring consequences on seed dispersion and plant recruitment; and (3) the current set of protected areas has the potential to protect half of current projected biodiversity, and that 55% of climatically stable areas identified in this study overlapped with PAs. In the context of decision-making, our models are important in suggesting insightful conservation strategies that involve not only improving currently established PAs but also demonstrating which areas to maintain and which to restore to optimize the potential for natural processes, such as dispersal and adaptation.</p>
