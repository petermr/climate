<p>Birds are good biological indicators of climate change impacts on NCP, since they occupy all terrestrial habitats, consume virtually all type of resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and therefore provide key ecosystem functions and services such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersion, predation, and scavenging [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Besides, they are one of the most well-known and studied groups, with a huge amount of data available. Nonetheless, even for birds, there is a deficiency of data in terms of describing and identifying the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest and providing high-quality species distribution data [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, according to the last available survey based simply on georeferenced occurrence maps [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], this biome harbours 1778 resident bird species. However, this number continues to rise as new species are discovered [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and to date, large areas have not been inventoried in Amazonia [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
