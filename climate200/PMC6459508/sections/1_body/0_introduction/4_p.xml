<p>Amazonia is a complex biome, and, just in floristic terms, it consists of areas covered either by forest (FT; 
 <italic>terra-firme</italic>), periodically inundated forested environments (
 <italic>várzea</italic>, 
 <italic>igapó</italic>), as well as open-area vegetation patches (OAV; 
 <italic>cerrado</italic>, 
 <italic>campinas</italic>/
 <italic>campinaranas</italic>, 
 <italic>cangas</italic>). This environmental heterogeneity is one of the leading factors responsible for its high species richness [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Brazilian Amazonia has already lost approximately 19.6% of its forest [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Land-use change caused by agricultural expansion, logging, mining and energy production are responsible for more than 90% of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the rapidity of environmental changes has increased the urgency of collecting, organizing and analysing biodiversity data to guide decision-making in conservation. Moreover, the NCPs are essential to human activities, and a better understanding of the range of ecosystem responses to climate change will help to improve the determination and the implementation of effective ecosystems management in a manner that promotes resilience [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], very few studies have evaluated how species will be affected by climate change in the near future [

 <xref rid="pone.0215229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and fewer studies have examined the consequences of climate change on functional diversity [
