<p id="Par5">Here, we report an approach that uses observed climatic limits for species derived from NHC data to quantify the safety margin (tolerance), adaptive capacity and risk to continental vegetation from climate change. Using approximately 2.5 million cleaned occurrence records for the Australian flora we calculate observed upper temperature and lower precipitation limits and breadths for 20,608 taxonomically-valid higher plant species. We aggregate these observed limits into metrics of tolerance and adaptive capacity in a set of vegetation units (100 km × 100 km equal area grid cells, hereafter ‘locations’) and combine them with climate projections to assess the likely exposure to future climate change by 2070. We address two questions:

   <p id="Par6">How does the risk of climate change to vegetation vary across the landscape and between Australia’s Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs)? Specifically, in which locations does predicted exposure to climate change exceed the safety margin for warming or drying in vegetation? Exposure (
    <italic>E</italic>) is estimated from projections of future climate for the decade centred on 2070, focusing on two drivers of vegetation distribution at a continental scale – mean annual temperature (MAT; °C) and mean annual precipitation (MAP; mm). Safety margins (
    <italic>S</italic>) are measured by quantifying how close the climate conditions in a location are to the upper limit of its hypothetical ‘typical’ species (Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This metric of climate change tolerance measures how much warmer, or drier, a location could become before its typical species exceeds its observed climatic limit, extending the idea of warming tolerance
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
    </sup> to large-scale vegetation communities. Climate change risk is then measured as the difference between exposure and safety margin in a location (
    <italic>Risk</italic> = 
    <italic>E</italic> – 
    <italic>S</italic>). In locations where 
    <italic>E</italic> &gt; 
    <italic>S</italic>, turnover in species composition may be necessary for vegetation to keep pace with warming or drying conditions. Conversely, a ‘typical’ species in locations where 
    <italic>E</italic> &lt; 
    <italic>S</italic> is expected to be able to withstand projected warming and drying trends. Our focus here on ‘typical’ species allows us to view vegetation as the product of a collection of species responses (while noting that, even where 
    <italic>E</italic> &lt; 
    <italic>S</italic>, at least some species may be adversely affected). We also identify which of Australia’s MVGs may be under most risk from changing climate conditions.

   <p id="Par7">What is the relationship between climate change risk and adaptive capacity in vegetation? We estimate the adaptive capacity of vegetation as the average observed breadth of climate conditions, considered across all co-occurring plant species. We hypothesise that species which span a wider breadth of conditions across their distributional range have a greater capacity to adapt to climate change. By contrast, species with narrow breadths (
    <italic>i</italic>.
    <italic>e</italic>., ecological specialists) may need to track conditions which most closely match a particular set of ecological dependencies, limiting their adaptive responses

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
    </sup>. Assessments of individual species ability to adapt to climate change are relatively commonplace and use a variety of techniques from genetics
    <sup>
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
    </sup>, manipulative experimentation

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>

     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
     <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
    </sup>. However, it remains unclear how species-level adaptive capacity might scale to larger units of biodiversity, such as vegetation types.
