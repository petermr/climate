 </sup>. At the species level, approaches for measuring response and adaptive capacity to climate change typically involve detailed experimentation, often including genetic or genomic analyses, to determine fundamental tolerance limits in controlled environments or field settings
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. These approaches are highly informative but cannot be applied practically to entire suites of species occupying whole regions or continents. For hyper-diverse groups – such as plants – scalable approaches which bridge between species-level information on tolerance limits and macroecological patterns are required
