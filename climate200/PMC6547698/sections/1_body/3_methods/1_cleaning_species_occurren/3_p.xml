<p id="Par32">Filters were applied to limit AVH records to valid spatial and taxonomic occurrences. This resulted in 2,303,015 valid occurrences across 20,608 species (mean and median of records per species are 112 and 45 respectively). Collection records were eliminated where they met one of the following criteria: (1) no valid species name in the APC, including being known only by an unratified name or hybrid designation (8.3% of raw data, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 360,684 records), (2) lack of geo-referenced coordinates, or coordinates which fall outside the mainland and Tasmanian Australian terrestrial administrative boundaries (9.9%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 427,563 records), (3) flagged as ‘suspected outliers’ by the ALA using a reverse jack-knife procedure assessing similarity of occurrences in environmental space (4.4%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 191,131 records), (4) cultivated origin, either flagged as such in the AVH or containing the search terms cultivat* and/or garden in a free-text search of the collection record (1.9%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 82,290 records), (5) being of non-native origin, identified by cross-checking to an exotic species checklist for Australia
