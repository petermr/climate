<p id="Par47">We calculated the spatial extent of 22 MVGs in the National Vegetation Information System which are at risk from climate change (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Shapefiles of MVGs were overlaid on climate change risk predictions to extract values. We excluded nine MVG categories which collectively occur across 15% of Australia (i.e. Inland aquatic - freshwater, salt lakes, lagoons; Cleared, non-native vegetation, buildings; Naturally bare - sand, rock, claypan, mudflat; Mangroves; Regrowth, modified native vegetation; Sea and estuaries; Unclassified forest; Unclassified native vegetation; Unknown/no data).
