<p id="Par45">We quantified the adaptive capacity of vegetation at each location by aggregating climate breadths calculated for each species. We assumed that a wider median climate breadth across all species at a location indicates a greater adaptive capacity to changing climate for the typical species in the vegetation

 <sup>nd</sup> and 98
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles of MAT and MAP conditions, respectively, experienced across the range of each species.
