<p id="Par39">To assess the potential truncation of the observed limits of species due to distributions being bounded by continental land limits we randomly selected 10% of species endemic to the tropical region of Australia (
 <italic>n</italic> = 370 species) and collated their occurrence data from tropical land areas north of Australia (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Solomon Islands) from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</ext-link>). Vouchered herbarium occurrences were available from these regions for 42 species and their upper MAT limits were extracted following methods described for Australian occurrences. We then calculated the difference between climatic limits derived from inside and outside Australia. The extent of truncation of climatic limits was relatively small, with most species (81%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 34 species) having 
 <italic>lower</italic> limits for MAT in locations outside Australia. For the remaining species (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) upper MAT limits were &lt;1° higher outside Australia (0.3–0.9 °C). Therefore, we assume that upper observed climate limits for temperature are rarely truncated by continental land limits in this study and that any truncation will be negligible when calculating the median safety margin of a typical species in each location across Australia (see Climate change risk predictions below).
