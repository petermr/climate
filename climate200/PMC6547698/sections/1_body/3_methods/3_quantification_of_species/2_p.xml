 </sup>. We used two approaches to partially address this issue. First, we tested the effect of combining our cleaned occurrence records with cultivated occurrences from 122 botanic garden inventories across Australia when estimating the observed upper temperature limits of species. This allowed us to the assess whether climate limits from natural history collections routinely underestimate the climate limits of the species and, therefore, affect the outcomes of our analyses

 </sup>. Second, we assessed whether the climatic limits of a suite of tropical species which occur in higher latitudes outside Australia are truncated by abutting the continental land limits of Australia. If widespread, this truncation could decrease the accuracy of estimates of the climatic limits of species.
