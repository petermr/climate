<p id="Par43">Exposure to climate change in each location was derived from anomalies between current and future projected climate conditions. To calculate anomalies for MAT and MAP, current long-term average climate conditions were subtracted from downscaled projections of future climate from five global circulation models (GCMs) in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 for the decade centred on 2070 accessed from

The median anomaly across the five GCMs (ACCESS1.0, CNRM-CM5, HADGEM2-CC, MIROC5, NorESM1-M) was calculated and aggregated to a 100 km × 100 km equal-area grid. These five GCMs were chosen for their high skill-scores in modeling various Australian climatic phenomena (
