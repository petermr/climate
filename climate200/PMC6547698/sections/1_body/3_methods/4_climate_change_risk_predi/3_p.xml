<p id="Par42">We also created standardised scores (
 <italic>z</italic>-scores) for the safety margin at each location for MAT and MAP to allow for comparison of patterns between climate variables which are measured in differing units (Â°C, mm). In each location, we performed 1000 random draws from the observed climate limits of all Australian species, constraining the species pool to those with an upper (MAT) or lower (MAP) limit which was lower or higher, respectively, than the long-term climate in the cell. This randomisation procedure produced an expected safety margin in each location which was compared to observed values to calculate 
 <italic>z</italic>-scores.
