<p id="Par24">Projected decreases in MAP exceed the drying tolerance of vegetation in south-west of Western Australia. In the SWAFR, vegetation in regions as at risk from MAP change in our analysis are already undergoing large-scale die-back events attributed, in part, to increased incidence of hot and dry conditions

 </sup>. Similarly, Western Australiaâ€™s northern Jarrah forests, species which occur on rocky soils with low water holding capacity are known to suffer high rates of dieback during extreme dry years

 </sup>. Our estimates of precipitation effects on risk are presumably very conservative since temperature and precipitation interact strongly. For instance, drier conditions can result even in the absence of a projected decrease in precipitation because increased MAT is accompanied by increased evaporation from the land surface, resulting in lower available soil moisture for a given precipitation. That said, there will be some tendency for higher atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> to ameliorate the physiological effects of reduced precipitation, through its positive effect on photosynthetic water use efficiency
