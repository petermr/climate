<p id="Par9">As a percentage of land area, 100% of Australian vegetation is exposed to increases in MAT and 26% to decreases in MAP by the decade centred on 2070 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C,D</xref>). The median projection across five GCMs shows exposure to MAT increase is likely to be greatest in the central inland regions of the continent (3.3–3.4 °C) however substantial warming is also projected in coastal regions (2.0–2.8 °C). Exposure to changing precipitation patterns also varies markedly across the continent. Substantial decreases in MAP (dark brown colours, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>) are broadly predicted for coastal regions in the south and for small areas in the north (coastal Queensland and Northern Territory). Substantial increases in MAP are predicted for vast areas of northern Australia and for coastal New South Wales, in the east.
