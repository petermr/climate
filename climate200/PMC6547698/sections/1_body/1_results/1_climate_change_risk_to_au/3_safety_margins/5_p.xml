 <italic>e</italic>., 
 <italic>z</italic>-score ≥1.96) occur across 11% of Australia (red locations in Fig.

 <italic>z</italic>-score ≤ 1.96) are found across the majority (60%) of Australia (blue locations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). In these regions, most locations have safety margins for reductions in MAP of &lt;200 mm and for temperature change between 2–4 °C (Fig.
