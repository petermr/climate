<p id="Par13">As MAT and MAP safety margins are measured in differing units, standardised 
 <italic>z</italic>-scores were also calculated for each location to allow comparison between climate variables (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). This null modelling indicated that the observed safety margins across 21% (MAT) and 34% (MAP) of vegetation were larger than expected under random expectation (dark red locations; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). In these locations, after comparing the observed and expected values, the comparative chance of detecting the observed safety margin was &lt;5% (i.e. 
 <italic>z</italic>-score =≤1.96, or ≥1.96).
