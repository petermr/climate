 <caption> Twenty-two Australian Major Vegetation Groups (MVGs). MVGs have been grouped into simplified vegetation units ( e. g., Acacia dominated) which are coloured in similar hues. White map units denote areas mapped as the MVGs excluded from our analyses (Inland aquatic - freshwater, salt lakes, lagoons; Cleared, non-native vegetation, buildings; Naturally bare - sand, rock, claypan, mudflat; Mangroves; Regrowth, modified native vegetation; Sea and estuaries; Unclassified forest; Unclassified native vegetation; Unknown/no data).
