 <caption> Standardised scores of the safety margins of Australian vegetation to changes in MAP ( A) and MAT ( B). Maps depict the deviation of the observed safety margin from random expectation ( z-score) under a null model using 1000 reassignments of observed niche limits. Dark blue and red represent locations where safety margins are lower or higher than expected, respectively, given observed species richness. Regions which have vegetation with significantly larger ( i. e., z-score ≥ 1.96), or smaller ( i. e., z-score ≤ 1.96), safety margins relative to chance for both MAT and MAP are depicted in ( C). The relationship between observed safety margins for MAP and MAT is shown in ( D). </caption>
