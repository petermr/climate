 <caption> Calculating safety margin at the continental scale. For this example, Australia is divided into a set of 100 km × 100 km, equal area (Albers projection) grid cell locations and intersected with 2,303,015 cleaned species occurrences (latitude and longitude coordinates of vouchered herbarium specimens) ( A), species lists are extracted for each location and matched to estimates of the upper, observed climate limit for MAT (°). An exemplar community of 4 species is shown here ( B). In ( C) a frequency distribution of climatic limits across all species is constructed for each location. The difference between the median of this distribution and the long-term average temperature in the cell estimates the safety margin of the ‘typical’ species to climate warming (MAT example provided here). This climate tolerance metric can then be mapped across the continent. </caption>
