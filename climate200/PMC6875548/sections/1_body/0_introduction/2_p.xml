<p id="Par3">For these reasons, the next generation of climate change research should address the combination of climate and socio-economic scenarios to a larger extent than now. For instance, O’Neill et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>) state that the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the climate projections based on them should be related to shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) representing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems. Moreover, Kriegler et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>) introduce the concept of shared climate policy assumptions (SPAs) representing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. However, this new scenario matrix (RCPs–SSPs–SPAs) is not yet available for research questions, and no common guideline is yet available on how to implement societal changes in impact studies.
