<p id="Par5">In this paper, we contribute to closing this gap by assessing and intercomparing the impacts of future climate change under a set of different socio-economic scenarios in the catchments of four European lagoons. Lagoons and their drainage areas are complex ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to climate change (Jeffress et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>) and anthropogenic stress factors such as inappropriate exploitation of resources, intensive agricultural land use and management, and inappropriate water use and management (Anthony et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). Moreover, the hydrological regime and water quality of the inflowing rivers, which depend on the environmental conditions and overall ecological status of the catchment, can put additional pressure on the lagoon (Liu et al.
