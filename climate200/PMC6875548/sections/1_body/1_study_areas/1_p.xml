<p id="Par7">The study areas were selected to represent a diverse set of “hotspot” coastal areas in Europe (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). They are characterized by different environmental, climatic and socio-economic conditions (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) that come along with various pressures and future challenges. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis that was carried out prior to this study identified point source and diffuse pollution and inappropriate water management practices as the major environmental problems (Lillebø and Stålnacke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). Eutrophication is already an issue in all four lagoons and can be related to changes in the water quality and quantity of the inflowing rivers. The implications of climate change (e.g., lower runoff due to a decrease in precipitation) and of conflicting activities (e.g., intensification of agricultural activities at the cost of good water quality for recreation) are expected to put additional pressure on the lagoons in the future (Lillebø and Stålnacke
