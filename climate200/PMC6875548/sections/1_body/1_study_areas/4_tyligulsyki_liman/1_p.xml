<p id="Par10">The Tyligulskyi Liman lies on the Ukrainian Black Sea Coast. The catchment’s fertile soils (mostly Chernozems) are mainly used for agriculture, but agricultural production is far below its potential. Still, nutrient pollution is a serious threat for the Liman, as untreated urban waste waters are discharged into the rivers. Moreover, there are over 150 artificial fish farming ponds with a total volume of 19 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> m³ (Tuchkovenko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>) that are refilled annually with water from the major rivers in the catchment, which causes a decrease of the freshwater inflow to the Liman by 35% (Tuchkovenko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>).
