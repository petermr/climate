<p id="Par81">The climate scenarios used in our study are all based on the same emission scenario (A1B). We did not account for any of the other four SRES emission scenarios, neither for climate scenarios based on the more recent RCPs, which would be nice to do in a follow up study. Another scenario related limitation of this study are the applied socio-economic scenarios that represent four considerably clear future states of economic development and environmental awareness, but do not account for any intermediate possibility. Moreover the socio-economic scenarios are not applied in a dynamic way but are rather considered as a static state of the catchment in future, which certainly does not reflect reality and prevents the assessment of interim changes. They are also not physically based and, unlike climate scenarios we cannot evaluate their reliability nor carry out an uncertainty assessment. Nevertheless, the socio-economic scenarios are considered realistic. They were developed together with stakeholders, which increases the likelihood of our results to be actually considered by policy makers for decision-making. Finally the limited data availability, especially with regard to nutrient calibration and parameterization of ungauged streams has to be mentioned at this point, as it is another reason why the results of the impact assessment should be considered critically.</p>
