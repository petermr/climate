  <list-item>
   <p id="Par28">The business as usual scenario (BAU) represents a possible future, based on past trends. It assumes a positive trend in economic development with negative effects for the environment.</p>

   <p id="Par29">In the managed horizons scenario (MH), economic growth comes along with the introduction of appropriate measures that are considered beneficial for the environment.</p>
