<p id="Par26">For the catchment of the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic>, no clear average trend in precipitation can be identified. Almost half of the scenarios simulate an average annual decrease, but there is no consistency in seasonal changes which would allow further interpretation. Precipitation projections are also very diverse for the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic>. Nevertheless, a slight downward trend can be identified for average spring and late summer precipitation. In the catchment of the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic>, all scenarios except one project an overall increase in precipitation, however, there is no clear seasonal trend. The temperature increases, but does not follow a seasonal trend in this catchment.
