<p id="Par21">The small number of water quality observations in all study areas did not allow a calculation of the common statistical model performance criteria. In the case of 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> we used nutrient concentrations, while in the other three cases nutrient loads but no corresponding discharges were available. We achieved satisfactory results regarding water quality calibration and validation based on visual comparison and by comparing the long-term means (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). SWIM simulated adequately seasonal dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as peaks and recessions that are typical for diffuse and point source pollution. Detailed results on water quality calibration and validation, including water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations can be found in Hesse et al. (
