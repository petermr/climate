<p id="Par13">The SWIM (Krysanova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>) is a semi-distributed, process-based tool simulating hydrological processes, nutrient dynamics, crop yields, and erosion. It has been successfully applied to river basins of different sizes in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America for various research questions (Krysanova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015a</xref>). The model is based on the models SWAT (Arnold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1993</xref>) and MATSALU (Krysanova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1989</xref>) and has a three-level disaggregation scheme: basin—subbasins—hydrotopes, with hydrotopes being sets of units with the same land use and soil type within one subbasin. Processes, such as water flows, vegetation growth, and nutrient cycling are first calculated for each hydrotope, and then aggregated at the subbasin level, from where lateral flows of water and nutrients are routed to the basin outlet.
