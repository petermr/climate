<p id="Par20">Although the model calibration was challenging, satisfactory results were achieved for all study areas (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in terms of Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and percent bias (PBIAS). The NSE is a nondimensional criterion describing the squared differences between the observed and simulated values (Nash and Sutcliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1970</xref>). It can vary from minus infinity to one (Nash and Sutcliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1970</xref>), with values above 0.6 considered as good, and above 0.8 as very good modeling results (Moriasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). The PBIAS shows the long-term relative differences of observed against simulated values and should be as near as possible to 0 for best modeling results. A PBIAS of ±10–15% is considered as satisfactory, while PBIAS ≤±3% means very good modeling results in hydrological applications (Moriasi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). In the case of Mar Menor, the coefficient of determination 
 <italic>r</italic>² was calculated instead of NSE due to scarce data.
