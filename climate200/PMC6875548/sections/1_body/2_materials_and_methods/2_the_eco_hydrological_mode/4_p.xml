<p id="Par19">SWIM was calibrated against observed river discharge and nutrient loads for each study area. In some cases only biweekly or average monthly values instead of daily data were available for comparison. Subsequently, calibration parameters, such as the groundwater delay time or correction factors of the curve numbers, were transferred to the ungauged parts of the catchments based on geophysical and hydrological similarities (e.g., similar aquifer, soil types, and land use). A detailed description of the calibration and validation procedure for each of the four study areas can be found in a separate report (Hesse et al.
