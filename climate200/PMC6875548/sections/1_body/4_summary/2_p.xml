<p id="Par72">The hydrological regimes in the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> and 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchments are relatively natural, and the simulated impacts correspond well to the projected trends in precipitation. Looking at simulated changes averaged over climate scenarios, we can see that the analyzed discharge and water cycle components decrease (−5 to −15%) in the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> and increase (5–10%) in the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment, more or less regardless of the applied socio-economic scenario. Only under the SET scenario for the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment, which represents a decreasing economic development and increasing environmental awareness water availability is reduced by the applied land use and management modifications, despite the increasing trend in precipitation for this region.
