<p id="Par74">In the most eastern case study area, the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> catchment, water resources are strongly regulated and the applied socio-economic scenarios, except the one following current trends (BAU) lead to a little increase in water availability. However, this increase is mostly reversed under climate change, as precipitation is projected to decrease on average.
