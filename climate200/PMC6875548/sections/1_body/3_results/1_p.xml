<p id="Par34">In this section, first the water flows and major nutrient loads in the four study areas are presented under the reference conditions (1971–2000). Next, the effects of land use and management changes on discharge, major water cycle components, nutrient loads and nutrient fluxes for the near future scenario period (2011–2040) are evaluated.</p>
