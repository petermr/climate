<p id="Par56">In the 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> catchment the decreasing trend in Q
 <sub>mam</sub> (see “Changes in seasonal stream flow components”) causes this reduction, as fertilizers are applied mostly in April (Hesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). This fact also explains why climate change weakens the increase of nutrient loads to the lagoon in the BAU and MH scenarios. In both scenarios agricultural land is slightly increased and mineral fertilization remains unchanged (BAU) or is increased (MH), which leads to an increase of nutrient loads.
