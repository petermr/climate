<p id="Par58">The effluents in the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment are treated in a high-end UWWTP. Nevertheless, point source pollution is still an issue, especially during the peak season in summer. Moreover, intensive agriculture also contributes significantly to the overall nutrient input to the lagoon, and especially the NO
 <sub>3</sub>-N loads. For instance, under the BAU and MH scenarios the emissions from the UWWTP are increased, whereas the agricultural area (BAU scenario) and mineral fertilization rates (MH scenario) are reduced. These changes lead to higher NH
 <sub>4</sub>-N and PO
 <sub>4</sub>-P, and nearly constant NO
 <sub>3</sub>-N loads. Regarding climate change, PO
 <sub>4</sub>-P is not very sensitive, whereas NH
 <sub>4</sub>-N and NO
 <sub>3</sub>-N are moderately to strongly influenced by changes in the climatic conditions.
