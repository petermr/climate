<p id="Par57">In the catchment of the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> the fertilization rates are too low to significantly contribute to the overall water pollution, whereas the emissions from point sources strongly influence the ecological status of the catchment and the adjacent lagoon. In the MH scenario, even a drastic increase in mineral fertilization (500%) in combination with a reduction in point sources (50%) leads to a decrease in average nutrient loads by 40%. Lower rates of untreated waste water disposal also cause moderate to small decreases in nutrient loads in the other three scenarios. With regard to climate change, a clear interpretation is difficult, because the disagreement among climate scenarios is large and causes large ranges of uncertainty.
