<p id="Par69">In the case of 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> the abandoning of agricultural land has different impacts on some of the nutrient processes than in the other three catchments. In the SET scenario half of the agricultural land is converted to fallow and forest but N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer and P-fertilizer are increased, which causes higher DENIT (+2%) and P-MIN (29%) as well as lower N-MIN and N-RUN (−6% and −22%). N-MIN and N-RUN decrease as the new land use types imply lower anthropogenic N input to the system, and lead to substantially lower runoff in the catchment. DENIT increases slightly, as it is less affected by LUC than but by an increase in N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer. P-MIN is clearly higher on former agricultural areas that have been converted to fallow (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). This type of LUC leads to a decrease in P-MIN in the other three catchments. However, in the case of 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic> there is additional input of P
 <sub>org</sub> from plant residue under the new land use type that compensates for the absence of input through fertilization and even leads to an increase of the P
 <sub>org</sub> pool and subsequently to an increase in P-MIN. This increase is 6% only in the CRI scenario, as the assumed LUCs are smaller. Accordingly, P-MIN is higher in the BAU and MH scenarios, as these two assume a slight increase in agricultural land. Moreover, in the MH scenario, N
 <sub>min</sub>-, P-, and N
 <sub>org</sub>-fertilization are also drastically increased (+100%, +100%, and +300%), which adds up to an increase of N-MIN (+9%), DENIT (+17%), and finally N-RUN (+36%) in the catchment.
