<p id="Par67">In the catchment of the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic>, only the SET and MH scenarios imply changes that are relevant for DENIT, N-MIN and P-MIN. N-MIN and P-MIN are projected to decrease for both scenarios by 4â€“8%. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows that N-MIN is drastically reduced inside the green corridor along the Tyligul River, where agricultural land has been converted to grassland. Removing fertilization in this area causes a strong decrease in the N
 <sub>org</sub> and P
 <sub>org</sub> pools, which leads to a decrease in N-MIN and P-MIN. The reduction of agricultural land also leads to a decrease, but the drastic increase of N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer (500%) in the MH scenario causes an overall increase in DENIT. In the SET scenario 30% of agricultural land is abandoned and N
 <sub>min</sub>-fertilizer is increased by only 200%. Consequently, a stronger decrease in N-MIN and P-MIN than in the MH scenario and a slight decrease in DENIT are simulated.
