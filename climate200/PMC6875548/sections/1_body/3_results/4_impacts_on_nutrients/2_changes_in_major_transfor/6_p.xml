<p id="Par64">The BAU, CRI, and SET scenarios in the 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic> catchment lead to a decrease in DENIT, N-MIN, P-MIN, and N-RUN. In all three scenarios, agricultural area is reduced or partly excluded from the irrigation zone. In addition, N
 <sub>min</sub>- and P-fertilizer are reduced in the CRI and SET scenarios. Changes in point sources have no impacts on the nutrient transformation processes or their transportation with runoff, as they are directly added to the stream flow. The most significant impacts are simulated for the CRI scenario, which predicts the biggest land use and management changes. The strongest decrease in DENIT is simulated on former irrigated land that is converted to fallow. The abandonment of nonirrigated agricultural land causes a smaller decrease, and agricultural land that is no longer irrigated shows the least impact.
