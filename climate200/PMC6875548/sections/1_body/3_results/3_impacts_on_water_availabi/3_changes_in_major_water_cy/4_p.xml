<p id="Par52">In the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> catchment, the BAU and CRI scenarios have no impact on the four water cycle components. The BAU scenario implies only a decrease in point sources and groundwater abstractions that have no influence on the water balance. In the CRI scenario half of the forested area is converted to fallow, and point sources as well as abstractions are reduced, but since forests account for &lt;4% of the total area (Hesse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>), no significant changes are simulated. Only the decrease of ponds (MH and SET scenarios) seems to have a relevant effect, especially on RUN and GWR, although certain LUCs also have important implications. For example, a buffer zone along the Tyligul River that is implemented by converting agricultural land to grassland causes an increase in ETp and ETa. However, when looking at the entire catchment these changes are averaged out and the impacts become negligible. Climate projections intensify the decreasing trends in RUN and GWR by about 15%. This is five times higher than the average precipitation trend (3%) and shows nicely the vulnerability of the catchment toward climate change. Furthermore, climate change will likely lead to an increase of average ETp and a slight decrease of average ETa.
