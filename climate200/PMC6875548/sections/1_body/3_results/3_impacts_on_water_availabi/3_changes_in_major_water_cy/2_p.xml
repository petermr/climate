<p id="Par50">In the case of 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic>, the socio-economic scenarios have no significant impact on the major water cycle components on average, whereas the combined impacts correspond well to the climate change signals. GWR and RUN are projected to decrease by 6% in response to the decrease in average annual precipitation. In addition, the spatial pattern indicates some changes that are related to vegetation cover. For example, in the CRI scenario more runoff is generated on deforested areas, as these have lower transpiration rates, which in this specific case allows higher surface runoff. The conversion of agricultural land into grassland causes a decrease in runoff in other areas due to improved soil permeability and water infiltration rates (lower curve numbers) and an overall higher transpiration rate (grassland has a permanent vegetation cover). ETp is projected to increase, which is the result of both an increase in the amount of energy available to evaporate water (net radiation) and a decrease in the atmospheric moisture content (humidity).
