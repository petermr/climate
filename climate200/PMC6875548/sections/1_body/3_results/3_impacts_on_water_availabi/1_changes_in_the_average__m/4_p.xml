<p id="Par42">The socio-economic scenarios for the 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic> catchment lead to a clear increase in discharge (e.g., 30% for Q
 <sub>10</sub> in SET scenario), which is reversed by climate change (âˆ’20% on average). Moreover, the combined impacts on Q
 <sub>90</sub> and Q
 <sub>50</sub> show considerable uncertainty reaching values of up to +500% in some scenarios. These big relative changes are the result of extremely low absolute values during the reference period, and a heightened sensitivity of the variables to climate change.
