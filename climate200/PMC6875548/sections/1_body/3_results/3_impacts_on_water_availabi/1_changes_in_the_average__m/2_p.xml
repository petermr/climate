<p id="Par40">In the 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic> catchment agricultural land is not dominant and water management plays a minor role, which explains the negligible effects of all four socio-economic scenarios. Adding climate change to these impacts a decrease in discharge can be observed. Relative changes and uncertainties among scenarios are largest for Q
 <sub>50</sub> and Q
 <sub>90</sub>, both of which are very low under the reference climate. Hence, even small variations in climate have a relatively large impact on them.
