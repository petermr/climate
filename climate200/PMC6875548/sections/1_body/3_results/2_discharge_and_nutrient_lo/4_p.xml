<p id="Par38">The nutrient loads show a similar pattern like the average water flow components. They are slightly higher than the average values obtained under observed climate in the cases of 
 <italic>Ria de Aveiro</italic>, 
 <italic>Tyligulskyi Liman</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vistula Lagoon</italic>, but lower in the catchment of 
 <italic>Mar Menor</italic>. In this catchment the ammonium nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus loads to the lagoon show no climate influence, since they are mainly from point source pollution (UWWTP).
