 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the results of the simulated water and nutrient flow components for the reference scenario period (1971â€“2000) driven by climate models data and for the calibration periods driven by observed climate data. This comparison provides an indication of how well simulations under climate scenarios can reproduce the hydrological conditions in the catchment.
