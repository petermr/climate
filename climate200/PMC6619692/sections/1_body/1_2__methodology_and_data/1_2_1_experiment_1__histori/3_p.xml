<p>The Caribbean vulnerability measure, CVS, used in this study, is formulated using the aggregate approach. CVS is first formulated using two sub-indices: demographic structure and socio-economic wellbeing. Each sub-index is obtained by doing a simple arithmetic average across its respective normalized indicators. There are three indicators for demographic structure (population density, dependent youth population, aged population) and four for socioeconomic wellbeing (gross domestic product growth rate, purchasing power parity, education, longevity). The demography and socioeconomic datasets for 2006–2011 are obtained from World Bank (2016) from
