<p>SDSM uses a hybrid statistical downscaling approach that incorporates multiple linear regression and weather generator schemes to create statistical models between predictors (e.g. geopotential height, relative humidity) and local station variables (rainfall). The statistical models are used to produce future daily rainfall time series. Statistical models for rainfall are created and validated using predictors from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis [

 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] global climate model outputs for 1961–2099 under the A2 and B2. Predictors are provided for a gridbox over or in closest proximity to the respective stations. [

The annual extreme rainfall indices are calculated from the model daily rainfall output for 2001–2015 (baseline), 2030–2039 (near term) and 2050–2059 (medium term) using RClimDex.
