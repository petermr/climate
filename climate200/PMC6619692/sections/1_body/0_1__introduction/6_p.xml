<p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methods and data used including the formulation of the CVS. Section 3 explores results of Experiment 1 (historical analyses). Section 4 discusses projections for climate as deduced by statistical downscaling and projections of future demography. Section 5 presents the results from Experiments 2 and 3 (changing climate only and changing climate and non-climate inputs). The results of Experiment 4 (equal versus unequal weightings and future climate) are also presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses some implications and limitations of the results in the broader context of the use of aggregate indices as a means of characterising vulnerability within an already highly vulnerable region.</p>
