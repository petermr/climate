<p>Global warming is also projected to significantly alter climate in the Caribbean region. End of century projections include increases in annual land and ocean surface temperatures of 1.0 to 3.5°C; changes in annual rainfall ranging between approximately −50 and +13.7% and mean sea level rise of up to 1.4m [
