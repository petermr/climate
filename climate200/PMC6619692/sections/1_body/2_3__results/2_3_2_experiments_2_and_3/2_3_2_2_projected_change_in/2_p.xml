<p>Under the lower emissions scenario B2, the suggestion is generally that of increases in the rainfall intensities over most stations. Increases are up to 17% (RX1) and 22% (RX5) as observed for Trinidad for 2030s and up to 42% (RX1) and 43% (RX5) as observed for Belize and Trinidad respectively for 2050s. Days above 10 mm are generally expected to decrease by up to 24 days (Barbados) for the 2030s but largely shift towards an increase by up to 51 days (Jamaica) by the 2050s.</p>
