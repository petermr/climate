<p>Projections for the near term (2030s) under the A2 scenario suggest decreases in maximum 1-day rainfall (RX1), maximum 5-day rainfall (RX5) and days above 10 mm (R10) for most of the 12 locations (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219250.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). Strongest decreases are indicated for some eastern Caribbean countries for RX1 and RX5 with values of up to 47% (St. Vincent) and 30% (Antigua) respectively. The greatest decrease in R10 is noted for the station in Jamaica at approximately 43%. The only stations for which increases are suggested are in Trinidad (for RX1), St. Lucia (for R10) and Bahamas (for RX5 and R10). For the medium term (2050s), decreases in RX1, RX5 and R10 continue to be the dominant response under the A2 (
