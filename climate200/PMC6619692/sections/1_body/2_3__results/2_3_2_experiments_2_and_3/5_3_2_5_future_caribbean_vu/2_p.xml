 <xref rid="pone.0219250.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the rank of countries for the future CVS based on changing climate under A2 and future demographic sub-index under SSP3 with constant socioeconomic sub-index (Experiment 3). Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Guyana are identified as the most vulnerable in order of decreasing vulnerability for the 2030s. For the 2050s, the Dominican Republic retains its rank as the most vulnerable followed by Belize and Jamaica. Barbados (7
 <sup>th</sup>) and the Bahamas (8
 <sup>th</sup>) are identified as the least vulnerable of the 8 locations for the 2030s and 2050s. These results show some similarity to the results from the future CVS calculated for a changing climate only (Experiment 2), in that, the locations in Jamaica and Guyana are again identified as among the most vulnerable for the 2030s and 2050s respectively. Of the 8 countries examined in Experiment 3, Cuba consistently had the lowest ranking in the future CVS analyses based on a changing climate and constant demographic and socioeconomic sub-indices (Experiment 2).
