<p>Data for only 8 of 12 countries are available for analyses involving future demographic projections. Vulnerabilities defined solely on the future demographic sub-index under SSP3 (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219250.s004">S4 Appendix</xref>) suggests that, in order of decreasing vulnerability, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Barbados are the most vulnerable by 2030 and 2050. In the historical analyses, Barbados and Jamaica were identified as the most vulnerable using this sub-index alone (see again 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g004">Fig 4</xref>). By 2030, Barbados and Jamaica rank respectively 3
 <sup>rd</sup> and 4
 <sup>th</sup>. Bahamas, Guyana and Belize are identified as the least vulnerable. The relative rank of all the countries remains the same between 2030 and 2050.
