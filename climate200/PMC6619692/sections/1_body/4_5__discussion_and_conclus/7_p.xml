<p>Finally, then, these results suggest that there is a place for the aggregate index approach in analyzing past and future comparative vulnerabilities to climate for the Caribbean. For the larger Caribbean countries the potential also exists to use these indices to differentiate vulnerabilities at the sub-national scale. The study results suggest, however, that when such indices are employed, they should account for intra-regional variations in climate. Additionally, the resulting analyses premised on aggregate indices must be accompanied by explicit explanations of the future scenario considered, the future time slice being examined, and if and how the climate information is weighted in determining the aggregate index, to aid in the interpretation of the results.</p>
