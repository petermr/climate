<p>For a comparison with another aggregate index, see again the available relative rankings for the Climate Change Vulnerability Index in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The relative rankings for overlapping countries are not very dissimilar except for Cuba and Antigua that in this study are identified as having lower vulnerabilities and St. Vincent and Barbados that are identified here as having higher vulnerabilities. Additionally, [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] ranks Jamaica as third of 75 countries in terms of economic risk from multiple natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, landslides, etc.). Dominican Republic (4
 <sup>th</sup>); Trinidad and Tobago (15
 <sup>th</sup>); Antigua and Barbuda (18
 <sup>th</sup>) are examples of other ranked Caribbean countries on the list [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also lists Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Haiti as the countries in the Caribbean with the highest disaster count in a 1950–2014 period (see their 
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found the most disaster-prone island group to be the Greater Antilles, with Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica reporting 47, 48 and 44 disaster events respectively for 1900–1997 and 20, 20 and 9 events for 1987–1997. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] further suggested that the Lesser Antilles have low to mid intensities of disaster.
