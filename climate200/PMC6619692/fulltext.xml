An aggregate vulnerability index, referred to as the Caribbean Vulnerability Score (CVS), is created using historical demographic and socioeconomic data and climate data representing extreme rain events. Four scenarios are explored. Firstly, comparative vulnerabilities are determined when heavy rainfall is incorporated in CVS versus when it is excluded. The impact of climate change is also investigated using future climate data derived from statistical downscaling but holding demographic and socioeconomic sub-indices constant. The analysis is repeated with projections of future demographic structure from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway data (SSP3), future climate projections and constant socioeconomic. Finally, the sensitivity of the results is examined with respect to applying different weights i.e. versus using equal weights for the climate and non-climatic components of CVS as is done for the first three scenarios. Results suggest that the inclusion of historical susceptibility to rainfall extremes influences relative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean when compared to the rankings of vulnerability derived using only socioeconomic and demographic inputs. In some cases significant increases in relative rankings are noted. Projected changes in the intensity of rain events across the Caribbean region in the 2030s and 2050s, do not significantly alter the top and lowest ranked vulnerable locations when demographic and socioeconomic indices are held constant. Changes may however occur in the order of the top ranked locations dependent on scenario and time slice. In general, future shifts in relative vulnerabilities were found to be dependent on (i) changes in both future climate and demographic scenarios, (ii) the time horizons being considered, and (iii) the weighting assigned to climate in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004429</institution-id><institution>Inter-American Development Bank</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG-T2255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Michael A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was facilitated through funding received from the Investment Plan for the Caribbean Regional Track of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) provided through the Inter-American Development Bank.

Introduction</title><p>Small island developing states (SIDS), including those in the Caribbean, are among the most vulnerable to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A growing body of research suggests that for the region as a whole, climate changes already evident include more intense rain events, longer dry spells, higher and more frequent extreme temperatures and rising sea levels (see for e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Other studies suggest a general intensification of these changes in the future under increased global warming projections (see for e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Vulnerability is, however, not uniformly distributed among the countries of the Caribbean, [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] due to variations in different factors governing exposure and resilience e.g. geography, demographics, economic ability to withstand and cope with disasters, and exposure to extreme climatic events. This paper attempts to explore the role of intra-regional variation in exposure to climate extremes when determining comparative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean.</p><p>Heavy rain events which occur over relatively short periods (sometimes associated with hurricanes and tropical storms but many times not), are a particular challenge for Caribbean territories. Events can occur yearly and repeatedly in a single year with far reaching impact (see for example <xref rid="pone.0219250.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for Jamaica). To explore how exposure to heavy rainfall extremes may influence comparative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean we define a simple index of vulnerability premised firstly on sub-indices representing socioeconomic well-being and demographic structure for 12 countries (see Section 2). The impact made on the relative rankings of vulnerability when climate sub-indices representing heavy rainfall events are also included in the simple index is then examined. (This analysis is hereafter referred to as Experiment 1). The index comprising the socio-economic, demographic and climate sub-indices is called the Caribbean Vulnerability Score (CVS). The formulation of CVS is further discussed in Section 2 (Methodology) and its potential significance as an indicator of vulnerability is discussed in Section 5.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0219250.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219250.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Some extreme rain events impacting Jamaica and their relative costs.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0219250.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0219250.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Event</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Year</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Category</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cost (J$ billions)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impact (%GDP)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Michelle</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2001</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.52</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">May/June Flood Rains</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2002</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.47</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Charley</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2004</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.44</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Ivan</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2004</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Dennis and Emily</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2005</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.98</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Wilma</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2005</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Dean</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2007</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tropical Storm Gustav</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2008</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tropical Storm Nicole</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2010</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hurricane Sandy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2012</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">March-June Rains</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2017</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>Source: Planning Institute of Jamaica.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Global warming is also projected to significantly alter climate in the Caribbean region.

The climate projections are used to investigate the sensitivity of the relative vulnerabilities determined by CVS to global warming induced changes in the heavy rainfall profile of the Caribbean. To the best of the authors&#x02019; knowledge this is the only study to date that attempts to quantitatively incorporate climate model projected change in an aggregate vulnerability index for this region. The investigation is first done using the future climate projections with demographic and socio-economic sub-indices held constant (Experiment 2). The analysis using future climate is then repeated for two other scenarios&#x02013;firstly with future demographic projections also incorporated and socioeconomic data held constant (Experiment 3); and secondly with different weightings applied to the climate (changing) versus non-climatic (constant) sub-indices (Experiment 4). The weightings used in Experiment 4 are explained in Section 2. All prior experiments assumed equal weightings for the sub-indices used in CVS. The aims of Experiments 2, 3 and 4 are respectively to examine (i) if projected changes in intra-regional variations in heavy rainfall due to global warming may alter present-day relative vulnerability rankings; (ii) the comparative influence of future changes in both climatic and non-climatic factors (relative to the present-day); and (iii) the potential sensitivity of the relative vulnerability assessments to the amount of influence assigned to the climate (changing) versus non-climatic (constant) sub-indices when formulating CVS.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methods and data used including the formulation of the CVS. Section 3 explores results of Experiment 1 (historical analyses). Section 4 discusses projections for climate as deduced by statistical downscaling and projections of future demography. Section 5 presents the results from Experiments 2 and 3 (changing climate only and changing climate and non-climate inputs). The results of Experiment 4 (equal versus unequal weightings and future climate) are also presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses some implications and limitations of the results in the broader context of the use of aggregate indices as a means of characterising vulnerability within an already highly vulnerable region.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2.

This allows the combination of different indicators in the relevant sub-index on a common scale for a given country. The countries used in this study are Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Trinidad &#x00026; Tobago. The sampling of countries is largely guided by the availability of demographic, socioeconomic and climate data, but is also meant to capture a wide range of relative vulnerabilities (see again <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g001">Fig 1</xref> for the vulnerability ranks for the countries for some indices described in <xref rid="pone.0219250.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In this study, normalized values for a specific indicator are obtained by subtracting its minimum value across all 12 countries from each country&#x02019;s indicator value then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values identified across all 12. See Eq (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0219250.e001">1</xref>). A similar normalization approach is proposed by [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

In cases where after normalization the sub-index shows an inverse association i.e. 1 representing the lowest level of vulnerability, the data are transformed by subtracting the normalized sub-index from 1. The socioeconomic sub-indices such as education, longevity and GDP were transformed. The CVS is then formulated using equal weightings for the two sub-indices.</p><p>In the second formulation of CVS, a climate sub-index is included. The three indicators comprising the sub-index are maximum 1 day rainfall, maximum 5 day rainfall and days above 10 mm. Historical daily rainfall data are sourced from a meteorological station in each of the 12 countries. It is important to note that only one station per country is used in this study. Whereas for some smaller islands the station may be representative of general conditions across the entire country, it is recognized that for the larger territories it is likely not. We discuss this limitation further in the discussion section but note here that (i) data limitations restrict creating country-scale indices for all the considered territories at this time, and (ii) the aim is to show the relative influence of including sub-regional variation in climate indices, which is still facilitated using the station data.</p><p>The daily data quality and homogeneity were assessed previously by [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Data for the period 1986&#x02013;2010 are used for the calculation of three annual extreme rainfall timeseries using the RClimDex software. RClimDex is a user friendly graphical interface that facilitates the computation of up to 27 core ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme indices [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The indicator value for each country is obtained by averaging values of extremes timeseries over 2006&#x02013;2011. The 2006&#x02013;2011 period is the span over which demographic, socioeconomic and climate data are available across all 12 countries. As before the sub-index is calculated using an arithmetic average over the climate indicators. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows a schematic of the approach.</p><fig id="pone.0219250.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219250.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Schematic on approaches used in study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0219250.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Experiments 2 and 3: Future vulnerability</title><p>Near term (2030s) and medium term (2050s) intense rain sub-indices are created for each station. The rain sub-index for each future period and for each location is created by calculating the arithmetic mean of the normalized future extreme rain indicators i.e. RX1, RX5 and R10. To determine future values of a rain indicator, a change factor is added to the historical indicator value (originally averaged over 2006&#x02013;2011). Change factors are obtained from analyses of daily rainfall projected for 1961&#x02013;2099 under the A2 and B2 emissions scenarios for each station using Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>SDSM uses a hybrid statistical downscaling approach that incorporates multiple linear regression and weather generator schemes to create statistical models between predictors (e.g. geopotential height, relative humidity) and local station variables (rainfall). The statistical models are used to produce future daily rainfall time series. Statistical models for rainfall are created and validated using predictors from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for 1961&#x02013;2001.

The annual extreme rainfall indices are calculated from the model daily rainfall output for 2001&#x02013;2015 (baseline), 2030&#x02013;2039 (near term) and 2050&#x02013;2059 (medium term) using RClimDex.</p><p>The change factor is obtained by calculating the difference between the average annual indicator value for the model baseline period and the average for each future period. The change factor is then applied to the historical intense rain indicator to obtain the future indicator value. For each location the future values of RX1, RX5 and R10 are then normalized (relative to other station values for the specific indicator) and combined to create the intense rain sub-index. In Experiment 2, this future sub-index is aggregated with the historical demography and socio-economic sub-indices to explore future comparative vulnerabilities across the region due only to a change in climate conditions. This process is undertaken for the SRES A2 (medium high emissions) and B2 (medium low emissions scenarios).</p><p>In Experiment 3, future vulnerability scores are obtained by considering both future climate and future demographic data with the socioeconomic indicator held constant. The future demographic data are obtained online through the publicly available interactive Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) web-database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb">https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb</ext-link>.

Data are available for 8 of the 12 countries&#x02014;Bahamas, Belize, Barbados, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago. The data are obtained for the years 2030 and 2050. The database provided data for the population but not the population density hence the population density was calculated by dividing the population total by the country size in square kilometres.

The future sub-index values provide some initial insights into comparative vulnerabilities across the 12 countries with respect to future intense rain events only (i.e. not considering demographics or socio-economic sub-indices). Under the A2 scenario, locations most vulnerable to intense rains are Jamaica, Guyana and Belize for the 2030s in order of decreasing vulnerability. However by the 2050s, though the locations in Belize and Guyana are still identified as the most vulnerable, only Guyana retains its rank. The location in Trinidad is now identified as the 3<sup>rd</sup> most vulnerable of the 12 countries. In fact the relative vulnerabilities suggested for 8 of the locations change between the 2030s and 2050s and only the locations in the Guyana (2<sup>nd</sup>), Cuba (6<sup>th</sup>), Bahamas (7<sup>th</sup>) and St. Lucia (10<sup>th</sup>) retain their relative rank. Under the B2 scenario, the climate sub-index deduced for the 2030s suggest that Belize, Dominican Republic and Jamaica are most vulnerable. These results may be viewed against the historical analysis where Jamaica, Belize and Dominican Republic are identified as the most vulnerable (see again Section 3.1).

In terms of suggested overall vulnerability, locations in Jamaica, Guyana and Belize are identified as most vulnerable by the 2030s under the A2. For the 2030s B2 analyses and for all scenarios by the 2050s, the same locations are identified as the most vulnerable but with a different order. For example, under the A2 by the 2050s Guyana and Belize are jointly the most vulnerable with Jamaica following. Under the B2 by the 2050s, the order of decreasing vulnerability is Jamaica, Belize and Guyana. It is noted that this latter order is also suggested for equal weighting, under the B2 for the 2030s and 2050s. Antigua is identified as the least vulnerable across all scenarios, formulations and timelines. Other countries in the three lowest vulnerability rankings were Cuba and Bahamas for the weighted approach across all scenarios and timelines. Recall that for equal weighting Grenada, Cuba, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Bahamas were interchangeably among the locations identified as least vulnerable across scenarios and timeline. The suggestion is that for the most and least vulnerable, there was some insensitivity to the weightings applied in this study. However for most countries examined, scenario, index formulation and the timeline considered are all factors that can influence the rank of locations with respect to their suggested vulnerabilities.</p><fig id="pone.0219250.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219250.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Ranking of countries based on Caribbean vulnerability scores.</title><p>Weighted average for (a) historical (2006&#x02013;2011), (b)-(c) A2 scenario for 2030s and 2050s relative to 2001&#x02013;2015 and (d)-(e) B2 scenario for 2030s and 2050s relative to 2001&#x02013;2015.

Discussion and conclusions</title><p>This study attempts to determine <italic>if and how past and future comparative vulnerabilities of some Caribbean countries to climate change may be altered when weather extremes are considered in the analyses</italic>. To do so, a simple aggregate index is formulated and calculated for twelve Caribbean stations for four experiments. The four experiments capture comparative levels of vulnerabilities to climate change using combinations of historical and/or future changes in intense rain events and demographic structure, and constant socioeconomic well-being. The results suggest the following:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Intra-regional variations in climate matter in the determination of comparative vulnerabilities for Caribbean countries. The results of Experiment 1 suggest differences in ranking when climate is explicitly considered as a variable in determining the relative vulnerabilities. In a number of instances vulnerability increased for the CVS calculated with (versus without) a climate sub-index. For example, there were shifts in ranks for Belize (4<sup>th</sup> to 2<sup>nd</sup>), Dominican Republic (6<sup>th</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>), St. Vincent (8<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup>), Trinidad (11<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup>) and Cuba (12<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup>). Interestingly, the particular climate extremes indicator used in this study (for heavy rainfall) appears to be a dominant influence on the suggested relative vulnerabilities for the present-day, for the CVS formulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Care must be taken when determining future vulnerabilities under a changing climate, as except for the most and least vulnerable, rankings shift dependent on scenario examined and time slice considered. This was generally true for Experiments 2 and 3 which respectively considered changing climate only (demographic and socioeconomic indices held constant), and changing climate and demographics (socioeconomic conditions held constant). The relative insensitivity of the most and least vulnerable was, however, noteworthy. For example, the locations in Jamaica and Guyana are consistently identified as among the most vulnerable for the 2030s and 2050s and in the historical analyses. This may suggest that future shifts in climate up to the medium term should be closely monitored by those already displaying extreme sensitivity and targeted actions taken to mitigate against this extreme sensitivity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Changing the weightings used in the CVS formulation influenced the relative rankings of locations, but there was also some level of consistency in the countries identified as most and least vulnerable. In Experiment 4, except for Jamaica, Guyana and Belize which were identified as most vulnerable, and Antigua which emerged as least vulnerable, rankings changed dependent on scenario, timelines and weightings used.</p></list-item></list><p>In this study, the formulation of the CVS was guided by other aggregate indices of vulnerability found in the literature (<xref rid="pone.0219250.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A deliberate attempt was, however, made to keep CVS simple in its formulation while still capturing potential variations in vulnerability to climate using climatic and non-climatic sub-indices. It was noted that of the 12 Caribbean countries examined in this study, locations in Jamaica, Guyana and Belize emerge as among the most vulnerable using historical values of the climate sub-index. This may suggest that these locations have a higher exposure to heavy rain hazards than many of the other locations examined in this study. Jamaica was again identified among the most vulnerable locations for the historical demographic sub-index suggesting an enhanced sensitivity likely due to a larger at-risk population. All three countries were also highlighted for elevated socio-economic vulnerability which likely indicates low adaptive capacity to risks posed by a changing climate. Furthermore, whether the scenario is less (more) intense rain events as generally suggested under the A2 (B2) scenario, Jamaica, Guyana and Belize are again identified as the most vulnerable locations for the 2030s and 2050s for the CVS premised on a changing climate with constant demographic and socioeconomic indices. Antigua was consistently identified as the least vulnerable.</p><p>For a comparison with another aggregate index, see again the available relative rankings for the Climate Change Vulnerability Index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219250.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The relative rankings for overlapping countries are not very dissimilar except for Cuba and Antigua that in this study are identified as having lower vulnerabilities and St. Vincent and Barbados that are identified here as having higher vulnerabilities. Additionally, [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] ranks Jamaica as third of 75 countries in terms of economic risk from multiple natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, extreme temperatures, droughts, floods, landslides, etc.). Dominican Republic (4<sup>th</sup>); Trinidad and Tobago (15<sup>th</sup>); Antigua and Barbuda (18<sup>th</sup>) are examples of other ranked Caribbean countries on the list [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] also lists Jamaica, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Haiti as the countries in the Caribbean with the highest disaster count in a 1950&#x02013;2014 period (see their <xref rid="pone.0219250.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found the most disaster-prone island group to be the Greater Antilles, with Cuba, Haiti and Jamaica reporting 47, 48 and 44 disaster events respectively for 1900&#x02013;1997 and 20, 20 and 9 events for 1987&#x02013;1997. [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] further suggested that the Lesser Antilles have low to mid intensities of disaster.</p><p>Notably a limitation of the current study is the absence of projections of socio-economic inputs in examining future vulnerabilities. As these datasets become available at the national and subnational levels the scope for undertaking similar investigations will increase. Additionally, it is recognized that the rainfall sub-indices used in formulation of the CVS are for one station in each country (many times the airport station) as for most countries examined this was the best and/or only daily data available. There is, then, an assumption that, especially for the smaller islands, the conditions that lead to repeated days of extreme rainfall are generally felt country-wide and result from larger-scale climatic phenomenon and are not so much topographically driven. With a renewed Caribbean drive to capture more and better data on sub-daily time-scales for each territory [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], future similar work will be able to utilize a climate index with greater country-scale representation. The formulation of the CVS also includes indictors that have associated limitations and may be open to other interpretations. For example, while a country may have a relatively lower population density which this study (following other reports) suggests is indicative of a relatively lower vulnerability, a context of the actual location of this population, for example, within 2 m of the coast would suggest a higher vulnerability. There is need therefore to continue to refine this work to obtain indices that are as representative to local circumstances as possible. Additionally some of the results for the vulnerabilities suggested by individual sub-indices and the CVS are worthy of further interrogation. For example this study suggests that with respect to the socio-economic sub-index the location in Cuba is among the least vulnerable given that its longevity is the highest in the selection of countries under investigation and its gross domestic product growth rate is second highest but is offset by its lower rank (7<sup>th</sup>) for the gross enrolment ratio, secondary for both sexes.</p><p>In the study, the 2030s and 2050s periods overlap with the periods where respective global warming targets of 1.5&#x000b0; and 2.0&#x000b0;C above pre-industrial temperatures are expected to be attained [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The climate risks that Caribbean SIDS will likely face in relation to these targets are described by [<xref rid="pone.0219250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This study, suggests that even amidst generally high risk for the entire region, the potential impacts on individual territories will not necessarily be uniform with some SIDS having disproportionate impact. There may therefore be need to further tease out the relative vulnerabilities of different territories at these future warming levels, with the possibility to do so offered by aggregate vulnerability indices like CVS.</p><p>Finally, then, these results suggest that there is a place for the aggregate index approach in analyzing past and future comparative vulnerabilities to climate for the Caribbean. For the larger Caribbean countries the potential also exists to use these indices to differentiate vulnerabilities at the sub-national scale. The study results suggest, however, that when such indices are employed, they should account for intra-regional variations in climate. Additionally, the resulting analyses premised on aggregate indices must be accompanied by explicit explanations of the future scenario considered, the future time slice being examined, and if and how the climate information is weighted in determining the aggregate index, to aid in the interpretation of the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219250.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Correlation results between observed and modelled extreme rainfall indices, using validation period.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219250.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219250.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Percentage change for climate indicators under the A2 scenario for the 2030s.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219250.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219250.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>CVS for the equal weighting formulation, under the A2 and B2 for the 2030s and 2050s.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219250.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219250.s004"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><title>Future demographic vulnerability ranking under SSP3 for the 2030s and 2050s.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219250.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219250.s005"><label>S5 Appendix</label><caption><title>CVS for the weighted formulation under the A2 and B2 for the 2030s and 2050s.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0219250.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was facilitated through funding received from The Investment Plan for the Caribbean Regional Track of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR).
