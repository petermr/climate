<p>Our study is the first to model plasticity in an EP construct and to extrapolate the results to predict the functionality of the construct and fitness prospects of organisms under climate change scenarios. We concede that our results should not be considered as representative for any spider web or EP construct from any given geographic region. That would require the collection of more specific EP property data for specific species and applying region-specific climate scenarios. Nonetheless, we think that it serves as an important template for future studies that endeavour to make predictions about the impacts of climate change on animals displaying EPs or other complex phenotypic features.</p>
