<p>We only tested herein whether temperature affected the structural integrity of the spider web and/or the molecular integrity of one material (i.e. MA silk) from which it is manufactured. Another possibility that is worthy of future study is that temperature changes affect spider physiology and thus hamper its ability to produce silks and/or construct a functional web. Indeed, a study on the effect of temperature on spider web building showed the web’s architecture to become affected; with fewer capture spirals with wider spiral spacing found in webs when the external temperature was lowered from 24°C to 12°C (
