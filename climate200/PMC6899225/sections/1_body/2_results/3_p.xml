<p>The reasoning behind the predicted changes in web performance is demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Here we plotted the maximum strain energy of the web and showed that in the cases where prey capture is effective, the web is able to contain the 1 mJ kinetic energy of the projectile. Whereas in cases where prey capture is ineffective, the peak energy is much lower since the forward velocity of the projectile is not entirely removed. Again, the high-humidity scenario is the worst performing, although the low-humidity scenario also performed poorly. In many cases, the energy transferred to the web is marginally &lt;1 mJ because the projectile never reaches a standstill in any of these simulations. Moreover, there is also gravity and damping interactions that may have additional effects on energy partitioning.
