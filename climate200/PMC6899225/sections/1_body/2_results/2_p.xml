<p>However, prey capture is not the only aspect of web functionality that we are concerned with here. Prey impact also causes damage to the web, and the spider must spend both time and energy repairing the damage. Our model was also able to calculate the stresses acting on the individual threads. 
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows how the distribution of thread stresses is affected by the changing material properties of the thread in each of the temperature and humidity scenarios. In all situations, the projectile can lead to web damage depending where the web is hit, but the distribution is much more left skewed (i.e. towards 1) in both the high- and low-humidity scenarios. In 
 <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, we show the actual number of broken threads generated by the 23 impact cases for the different climatic conditions and support the suggestion (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Boutry and Blackledge, 2013</xref>) that lowering the humidity leads to both significant web damage and reduced prey capture.
