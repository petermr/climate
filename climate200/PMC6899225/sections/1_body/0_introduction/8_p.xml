<p>One study (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Boutry and Blackledge, 2013</xref>) has examined the influence of humidity on spider web prey capture performance. It showed that webs at high humidity (&gt;70% RH) intercepted prey better without breaking than did those at low humidity (30–35% RH). The authors attributed this finding to MA silks within the web’s radials shrinking and becoming more compliant (a phenomenon called supercontraction) thus dissipating more kinetic energy at impact. In addition to providing a mechanism for tensioning webs, supercontraction at high humidity might counteract web stiffening at ecologically high temperatures in tropical orb webs. Spiders constructing webs in Sydney in the summer of 2090 will, nevertheless, likely be exposed to extremely high temperatures and low humidity. It might accordingly be expected that their prey capture performance will become critically impaired compared with that of today’s spider webs.
