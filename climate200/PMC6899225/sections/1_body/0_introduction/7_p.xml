<p>Exposure to ecologically high temperature and low humidity induces mechanical property changes in MA silk, with its strength and stiffness increasing with temperature (

 </xref>). However, the functional consequence of different temperatures on spider webs has never been empirically determined. This is, by and large, because of the complexity of interplaying variation in the following: (i) the web building, silk spinning and locomotor behaviours of the spider (
