<p>Temperature and humidity are environmental variables known to affect the mechanical performance of somatic phenotypic traits, such as stimulation of motor nerves, and muscle activation and relaxation time in fish and frogs (Johnston and Temple, 2002;

Around Sydney, Australia, for instance, annual temperatures are predicted to increase by almost 5°C by 2090 under the most extreme climate change scenarios. This will be manifested as more days (11 up from 3 at present) per year exceed 35°C. Meanwhile, mean spring rainfall is expected to reduce by as much as 34%. All the while, relative humidity will decrease by up to 4% across all seasons, and evapotranspiration will increase by as much as 18% (
