 <caption> The web geometry created based on those measured for A. radon ( Harmer et al., 2015 ). Twenty-three target locations for projectile impact were also defined on a regular pattern to cover the web surface as illustrated. The model consists of 31 radial threads and a single spiral thread that makes 43 turns, as specified in Table 1. The web is suspended in a square frame. The model consists of 2731 links, made up of 43 + 2×31 radial links, 43×31−1 spiral links and 4 frame links. </caption>
