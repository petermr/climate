  <p>The web geometry created based on those measured for 
   <italic>A. radon</italic> (
   <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Harmer 
    <italic>et al</italic>., 2015
   </xref>). Twenty-three target locations for projectile impact were also defined on a regular pattern to cover the web surface as illustrated. The model consists of 31 radial threads and a single spiral thread that makes 43 turns, as specified in 
   <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The web is suspended in a square frame. The model consists of 2731 links, made up of 43 + 2×31 radial links, 43×31−1 spiral links and 4 frame links.
