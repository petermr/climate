 <caption>
  <p>Location of white spruce provenances and test sites (a) and their climatic conditions (b). The 33 provenances are assigned to geographic regions with similar climate that approximately correspond to the Canadian ecozone classification system. The vectors in the principal component analysis show how provenances and regions are associated with climate variables. Climate variables include mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean summer precipitation (MSP), precipitation as snow (PAS), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), growing degree‐days above 5°C (DD &gt; 5), continentality (TD), chilling degree‐days (DD &lt; 0), frost‐free period (FFP), annual and summer heat‐moisture index (AHM, SHM), as well as Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit (CMD). Latitude, longitude, and elevation are represented as dashed arrows and were not part of the ordination. The species range of white spruce is shown in green</p>
