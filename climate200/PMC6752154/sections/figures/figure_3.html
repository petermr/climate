 <caption> Correlations among the climate of provenance origin and growth measurements at the field site and drought metrics calculated from tree ring analysis. Significant correlations after adjustment for multiple inference are highlighted with asterisks ( p &lt; .05). Climate variables include mean annual temperature (MAT), chilling and growing degree‐days (DD &lt; 0, DD &gt; 5), mean temperature for the warmest (MWMT) and coldest month (MCMT), frost‐free period (FFP), continentality (TD), growing season precipitation (May to September) (MSP), annual precipitation (MAP), precipitation as snow (PAS), annual and summer heat–moisture index (AHM, SHM), and Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit (CMD).
