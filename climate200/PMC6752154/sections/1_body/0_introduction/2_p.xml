<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, mean annual temperature across the North American boreal forest has increased by 1.5 to 2.5°C, significantly exceeding the mean global temperature increase (Romero‐Lankao et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In the western boreal, climate conditions have also become drier by around 10% in mean annual precipitation (Mbogga, Hamann, &amp; Wang,

 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Warmer temperatures and reduced precipitation together have induced widespread impacts on the boreal forests and its ecosystems due to drought stress (Price et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Across large regions, where water deficits limit growth, reduced forest productivity has been documented for western boreal tree species (Chen et al.,
