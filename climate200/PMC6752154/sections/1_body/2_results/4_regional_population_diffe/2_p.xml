<p>Best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of regional population means were estimated with generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for survival rate, and linear mixed models (LMMs) for all other traits (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Conforming to the expectations that local sources would be best adapted to the climate of the planting site, provenances from the Boreal Plains had the lowest mortality and showed good growth performance, with one of the highest height and diameter values measured after 32 and 27 growing seasons, respectively. Populations from Temperate Mixedwood (southern Ontario) and Boreal Shield (Ontario and Quebec) showed even better growth than local sources with the latter one originating from regions approximately 5Â°C warmer and double the annual precipitation compared to the test site (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The excellent growth performance of the nonlocal sources from the Boreal Shield did not significantly compromise survival (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In contrast, the sources close to the west coast and east coast had inferior growth performance and low survival rates at the central test site.
