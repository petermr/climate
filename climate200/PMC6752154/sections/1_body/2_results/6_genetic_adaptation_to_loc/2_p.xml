<p>Seed sources originating from warm and wet origin climate showed superior growth potential at our test site (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Height and diameter positively correlated to long and moist growing seasons of the provenance origin climate. In contrast, a high survival rate was closely associated with dry environments and cold, prolonged winters. Survival rate showed no correlations with climate variables strongly associating with height and diameter. Resistance for the 1999 drought was negatively related to growing season length and summer precipitation of the provenance origin climate, which mirrored associations with height and diameter. Therefore, trees from warm and moist climate conditions grow well, but also experience the proportionally largest growth reductions under drought conditions. For the climate conditions during the 2002 drought period, characterized by a cool spring and dry summer, correlations among provenance origin climate and drought metrics were weak (

 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Provenances from continental climates (dry, hot summers with cold winters) maintained better growth under the 2002 climate conditions. Since the recovery index is an inverse calculation of the resistance values under full recovery, matching, but opposite correlations for recovery and resistance indices were observed for each disturbance. No genetic differentiation and no strong associations were identified between resilience and the origin climate of provenances, indicating that provenances have comparable drought resilience, with all regional populations avoiding permanent damage from the drought episodes.
