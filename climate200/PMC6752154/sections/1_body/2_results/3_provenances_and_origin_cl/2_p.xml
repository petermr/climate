<p>Most geographic groups of provenances had distinct regional origin climates, except the Montane Cordillera region, which comprises a variety of climates due to complex topography (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The vectors represent the strength and directions of correlations of climate variables with the first two principal components. Provenances with high scores in the first principal component (PC1) (right side of Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) experienced a long growing season (MAT, MCMT, opposite DD &lt; 0) and high moisture availability (MAP, MSP, PAS, opposite SHM). Provenances that score high for the second principal component (PC2, y‐axis of Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) experienced low growing season temperature variables (MWMT, DD &gt; 5, FFP). Together, PC1 and PC2 explained 82.5% of total variance in climate variables.
