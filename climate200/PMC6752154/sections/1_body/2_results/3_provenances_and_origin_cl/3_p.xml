<p>The coldest and driest climate of the sample design was found in the Boreal Cordillera and Boreal Plains ecoregion of western Canada (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The eastern neighboring area, the Boreal Shield ecoregion comprising Ontario and Quebec sources, showed similar temperature conditions but twice the precipitation, which results in a lower annual moisture deficit. Maritime Mixedwood provenances from the east coast received the highest precipitation, the smallest moisture deficit, and the warmest winters. The southeastern Temperate Mixedwood ecoregion of southern Ontario had high annual moisture deficits due to high temperature. Montane Cordillera of the west coast was characterized by maritime climate with cool summers, relatively mild winters, and a low continentality score.
