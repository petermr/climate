<p>For the eastern half of the species range, projections up to the 2080s do not appear to exceed values of 250 mm in moisture deficits. Results from the provenance trial further show that eastern provenances generally grow well under these conditions. In the northeast, predicted climate moisture deficits are generally above 100 mm, substantially wetter than the planting site (152 mm). These results support the view that northeastern regions of Canada appear to be a likely refugium for boreal forest tree species in a warming climate (D'Orangeville et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), while the western part of the boreal forest is prone to growth reductions under warming environment because of moisture sensitivity. For resource managers and policy makers, our results suggest that planning for widespread declines of western boreal white spruce forests may be unavoidable in many parts of the species range. Specifically, moving seed sources northward in the western boreal region to counter anticipated moisture deficits may not be an effective climate change adaptation strategy.
