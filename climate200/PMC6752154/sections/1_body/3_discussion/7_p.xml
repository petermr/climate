<p>To provide additional context for interpreting the results of this common garden experiment, we provide maps of moisture deficits for the species range of white spruce for the 1961–1990 normal period and projected future conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), generated with the same methodology as for obtaining moisture deficit estimates for the test site and provenance locations (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Generally, climate moisture deficits for the range of white spruce ranges from values close to zero in the northeast to values of around 250 mm in portions of its western range. Ensemble projections from CMIP5 global circulation models according to Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) show that 250 mm moisture deficits are exceeded along the southern fringe of the species distribution as well as for large parts of Alberta and the Northwest Territories (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, brown hues). This is substantially drier than at the test site during the growing period (152 mm). Given the observed growth response during drought years, it seems likely that white spruce growth throughout the generally drier western portion of the boreal forest may on average be reduced by a substantial amount (up to 50% observed in this experiment), without the option to adapt to climate change by selection of drought‐tolerant populations in reforestation programs.
