<p>The most notable result from this range‚Äêwide provenance experiment is that no obvious adaptation in growth and survival was observed in response to various precipitation regimes (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), conforming to the finding of equal drought resilience even when provenances from throughout the natural range were exposed to extreme drought conditions that severely impacted the annual growth of all provenances (up to over 50% growth reduction compared to a normal year). While resistance and recovery metrics significantly varied among populations (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12845-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), no crossover interactions were observed where a provenance with lower growth under favorable moisture conditions exceeds productive provenances under drought conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12845-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). No population was able to maintain a substantially higher level of productivity under drought constraints. This implies that the species as a whole may lack genetic variation and adaptive capacity to maintain growth under drought. That said, our sampling design did not cover a sufficient amount of samples from isolated or marginal populations at the southern boreal fringe, where such adaptation may still be found.
