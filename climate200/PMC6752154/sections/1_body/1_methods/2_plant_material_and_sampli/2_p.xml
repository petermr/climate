<p>White spruce seedlings from 43 provenances across Canada were planted at a common garden trial near Calling Lake, Alberta, (55°17’N, 113°09’W, 625 m ASL). Planting stock consisted of containerized seedlings, germinated in 1978 and planted in 1982. This field trial is a randomized complete block design with 5 blocks, 5‐tree row plots with 2.5 m × 2.5 m spacing. Two border rows were planted to minimize edge effects. Tree height and survival were evaluated at age 32, and the diameter at breast height (DBH), approx. 1.3 m above the ground, was measured at age 27.</p>
