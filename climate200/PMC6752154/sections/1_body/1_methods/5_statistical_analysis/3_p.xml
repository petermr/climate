<p>The survival rate of white spruce from each region was estimated by fitting generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for binomial data with the 
 <italic>glmer</italic>() function of the lme4 package (Bates, Machler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Since only one tree per provenance of each block was sampled for drought resilience analysis, our linear mixed models for drought indices specify regions as fixed effects and blocks as random effects. For multiple pairwise statistical comparisons among regions, we corrected the α‐value with a Tukey adjustment, implemented with the 
 <italic>cld</italic>() function of emmeans package (Lenth, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The residuals of each mixed model were visually checked for meeting assumptions of the respective distributions of errors.
