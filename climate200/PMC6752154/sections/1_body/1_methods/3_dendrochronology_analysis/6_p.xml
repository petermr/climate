<p>In our common garden experiment, the two‐year period between the first and second drought events was not long enough for trees to fully recover from the very first drought event. We therefore used five years before the first drought (1993–1997) and five years after the second drought (2003–2007) as predisturbance and postdisturbance reference periods for calculation of indices for both drought events.</p>
