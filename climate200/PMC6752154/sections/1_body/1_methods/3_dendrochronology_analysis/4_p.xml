<p>Cross‐dated chronologies were then subjected to detrending, because ring width is controlled not only by growing conditions but also by the age of the tree, with the ring widths near the pith being largest. In standard dendrochronological research, this age‐related trend is removed by subtracting a spline function fitted to each chronology. The residual after detrending is then converted to a standardized chronology with a mean of one and interannual growth variation expressed in units of standard deviations for further analysis (Cook, Briffa, Shiyatov, &amp; Mazepa, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). However, fitting individual splines to trees grown in a common garden experiment for detrending might partially remove population differences. We therefore used a common spline function that has the same shape for all trees. Further, in our common garden trial, where all trees have the same age and were grown under controlled environments, the absolute growth value carries important information. We therefore did not work with standardized ring widths, but reversed the standardization after detrending using the original average and standard deviation of each tree ring chronology. The detrending was implemented with a smoothing parameter of 0.7, a relatively stiff spline, fitted to the combined normalized chronology data with the
