<p>To quantify white spruce resilience to the two drought events, we calculated indices for resistance, recovery, and resilience (Lloret, Keeling, &amp; Sala, 
 <xref rid="eva12845-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Resistance was calculated as the ratio of the radial growth during the drought over growth before the drought (higher resistance value indicates a small growth reduction during the event). Recovery was measured as the mean postdisturbance growth divided by the growth during the drought year (high recovery values indicate a strong rebound of growth after disturbance). The resilience index is the ratio of growth performance after and before the disturbance to quantify permanent damage (a resilience value below one suggests the tree failed to recover to the predisturbance performance after the drought).
