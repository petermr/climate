<p>The results highlight that population differentiation in adaptive capacity to climate environments can be species‐ and trait‐specific, and we provide a counterexample where assisted migration prescriptions may be ineffective to mitigate climate change impacts in the western boreal portion of the species range. The study also provides direct evidence that northeastern populations of white spruce may be safe from negative climate change impacts for the medium‐term future, with no permanent damage observed on northeastern populations when subjected to drought conditions at the test site that they would be unlikely to experience in their native region even under pessimistic climate change projections by the 2080s. In contrast, the fate of western populations is more difficult to assess based on direct evidence from this study. We observed strong growth reductions, but no permanent damage arising from droughts in a region where the average annual water deficit is around 150 mm. However, this value is predicted to be exceeded by the 2050s throughout the western half of the species distribution. Planning for widespread declines of western boreal white spruce forests may be unavoidable where water deficits limit the species productivity. This may lead to large‐scale mortality as recently observed for lodgepole pine in western boreal forests. Such subcontinental‐scale ecosystem disruptions are likely too large to be effectively mitigated through forest management or reforestation prescriptions.</p>
