  <p>Abundance (rarified counts) of OTUs found at week 5 showing significant differences in abundance (one-way ANOVA) between polluted and non-polluted treatments (i.e., CONT vs. POLL and SOIL-EX vs. SOILâ€“POLL). Error bars represent the standard deviation (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Specific taxonomic classification corresponding to these OTUs is shown in Table 3.
