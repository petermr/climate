 <caption> Abundance (rarified counts) of OTUs found at week 5 showing significant differences in abundance (one-way ANOVA) between polluted and non-polluted treatments (i.e., CONT vs. POLL and SOIL-EX vs. SOILâ€“POLL). Error bars represent the standard deviation ( n = 3). Specific taxonomic classification corresponding to these OTUs is shown in Table 3. </caption>
