<p>Given that individual actions or the collective actions of many individuals cannot ameliorate climate change within a limited space-time frame, it appears intuitively reasonable that individuals who realize the intractability of climate change are likely to be inactive against climate change. Taking carbon emissions as an example, a recent report on the 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Global Carbon Budget, 2017</xref> published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) claimed that global CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions in 2017 reached a new record of 36.8 Gt (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Global Carbon Budget, 2017</xref>). Although many actions with the potential to reduce annual personal emissions have been recommended, e.g., living car-free (2.4 tCO
 <sub>2</sub>e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 tCO
 <sub>2</sub>e saved per roundtrip transatlantic flight), and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO
 <sub>2</sub>e saved per year) (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Wynes and Nicholas, 2017</xref>), emissions reductions realized by individual lifestyle changes still seem rather trivial. In this case, it is possible that individuals may consider climate change an intractable issue, since their low-carbon behavior is ineffective or meaningless for climate change, which in turn limits their action on climate change.
