<p>Furthermore, individualism and collectivism may relate to different propensities to perceive climate change as intractable. Individualism and collectivism may involve the perceived intractability of climate change in two ways. In the first, when confronted with climate change, individuals with individualist orientations usually rely on a self-reliant coping style, that is, viewing behavioral changes related to climate change as a personal matter and tackling climate change on their own. In this case, individualists may feel that climate change is so intractable that it cannot be solved by their individual actions. By contrast, when confronted with climate change, collectivists may regard fighting climate change as a collective mission, and thus, although individual contributions are small, they still matter. Hence, it is less likely for collectivists to perceive climate change as intractable. As a second example, it has been found that individualism and collectivism differ in social desirability: collectivists are more likely to be socially desirable than individualists (

Given that members of society are expected to take action against climate change, it is evident that collectivists are more responsive to this social expectation than individualists. In this case, in order to maintain a positive and normative image, collectivists are less prone to acknowledge that climate change is intractable.
