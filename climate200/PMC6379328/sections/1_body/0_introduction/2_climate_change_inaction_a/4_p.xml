<p>Unlike the above-mentioned research, climate change inaction research places a direct emphasis on the circumstances in which people stay inactive in the face of climate change. This research argues that we must first clarify the causes of climate change inaction in order to overcome it (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Pölzler, 2015</xref>). There is a large body of researchers attempting to identify the constraints of climate change inaction. Among these, psychological barriers have attracted much attention, as they are more susceptible to interventions than are other factors (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzoni et al. (2007)</xref> identified a range of barriers that members of the United Kingdom public perceive to engaging with climate change, i.e., uncertainty, skepticism, and reluctance to change one’s lifestyle. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gifford and Chen (2017)</xref> demonstrated that three kinds of psychological barriers are significantly associated with fewer climate-ameliorative food choice intentions (e.g., purchase organically grown food, eat less meat): denial (e.g., “There’s no need to make these changes because I’m not convinced that a serious environmental problem even exists”), conflicting goals and aspirations (e.g., “I’m concerned that these changes will take up too much of my time”), and tokenism (e.g., “I’m satisfied with my current way of doing things”).
