<p>One hundred and ninety-eight undergraduates initially volunteered to participate in the study, recruited from a large subject pool from Nanjing University. All participants were evenly distributed to the experimental or control group. Seventeen cases were deleted for not returning their questionnaires. Thus, the final sample was based on a total of 181 participants (experimental group: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 98; control group: 
 <italic>n</italic> = 83). Their mean age was 20.80 (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1.98), and 51% of them were females. They were paid 30 CNY (around 5 USD) for their participation.
