<p>Participants were asked to complete the survey experiment via Wenjuanxing. The experimental procedure was as follows. First, given that Study 1 showed that BCC and CCRP are potential contributors to climate change inaction, the experimental and control groups first completed the BCC and CCRP instruments, which were the same as those used in Study 1, before receiving subsequent interventions. We aimed to test whether the baseline levels of BCC and CCRP were similar between the experimental and control groups in order to control for their confounding effect on CCI. Second, participants read a passage about climate change, which served to manipulate the PICC variable. Specifically, the experimental group was presented information indicating climate change is inherently intractable, whereas participants in the control group were presented with neutral information describing the manifestations of climate change, i.e., global warming, acid rain, and ozone depletion (see Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="A1">1</xref>). After reading these distinct passages, both groups reported their perceived intractability of climate change as in Study 1. Third, all participants finished the measurement of CCI. Unlike Study 1, a novel measure of CCI was employed in the present study. Considering that individuals’ climate change (in)action may depend on the level of knowledge about climate-friendly behaviors, we created a questionnaire to measure participants’ KCCA. Participants were presented with a checklist containing ten daily behaviors. Sample items include “Cut meeting times as short as possible,” “Eat less meat if you can,” and “Machine-wash clothing only when there is a full load.” We instructed them to identify whether each item in their view is climate-friendly with yes or no (yes = 1, no = 0). As a matter of fact, all the items are climate-friendly. We calculated the measure of KCCA by adding the participants’ answers, so that higher scores indicate higher levels of KCCA. Participants were then asked to report how likely they were to perform their chosen behaviors in the future on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic>highly unlikely</italic>) to 7 (
 <italic>highly likely</italic>). The values were reversed so that high values represented high CCI.
