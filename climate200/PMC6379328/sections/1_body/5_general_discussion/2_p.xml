<p>The present findings may contribute to increasing our understanding of climate change inaction. The critical role of psychological barriers in climate change has been underlined by the recent researches (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Gifford, 2008</xref>). Existing theories and empirical studies have proposed a wide variety of psychological barriers that trigger climate change inaction (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Frantz and Mayer, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aitken et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Salomon et al., 2017</xref>). However, the literature is still limited on how the latent psychological barriers incur climate change inaction. In this article, we argue that the construct of perceived intractability provides a useful perspective from which to examine this matter. Without doubt, climate change is intractable in itself because greenhouse gas emission cannot be drastically reduced by the efforts of scattered individuals. This perceived intractability of climate change may further induce individuals to remain inactive against climate change. Our work is the first to show that the incidence of climate change inaction is indeed related to perceived intractability even when other related variables were controlled for. This result is in line with findings reported by previous literature. 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aitken et al. (2011)</xref> found that stronger perceptions of powerlessness were related to lower levels of action to mitigate climate change. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Salomon et al. (2017)</xref> suggested that energy conservation behavior was connected with climate change helplessness-the belief that oneâ€™s actions cannot affect climate change. In this sense, perceived intractability offers another avenue of insight to help us to understand why we are so reluctant to take action against climate change.
