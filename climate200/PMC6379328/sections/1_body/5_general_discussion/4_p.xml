<p>The present findings may shed some light on nudging public engagement in climate change. Public engagement, as one critical aspect in addressing climate change, has been repeatedly emphasized in public policy agendas worldwide. From an instrumental perspective, climate change is in no small part due to human activity, or more accurately, innumerable individual activities. Thus, any policy or action aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation will largely depend on public support and participation. However, the resounding calls for public engagement raises one challenge for academics and practitioners, namely, how to promote public engagement in climate change (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Campbell (1983)</xref>, climate change is not intractable in itself given the potential efforts of every member of human society. Nevertheless, the results of the present paper suggest that perceived intractability may induce climate change inaction. Thus, it is inadvisable to rush to calls for public engagement in fighting climate change; instead, policymakers should encourage the public to believe that their individual actions are necessary as well as efficacious. More importantly, risk communication in the context of climate change should inform the public that climate change is not just potentially catastrophic, but solvable. This promising tactic is specific to special groups with individualist orientations, as they are more inclined to view climate change as intractable.
