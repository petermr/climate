<p>A central focus of the present article was to examine whether individualists would report a greater incidence of climate change inaction due to higher perceived intractability than collectivists. For this purpose, three studies were conducted. The main findings can be readily summarized. Study 1 showed that participantsâ€™ self-reported frequency of climate change action in the preceding 6 months was negatively related to their perceived intractability. In other words, the more intractable participants felt climate change to be, the more demotivated they were to take climate change action. This result was supported in Study 2, which suggested that participants exposed to information concerning the intractability of climate change showed a significantly greater perceived intractability of climate change and lower intentions to assume a low-carbon lifestyle than those presented with neutral information. Based on the first two studies, participants with a collectivist or individualist orientation were recruited from a pool of Chinese undergraduate students in Study 3. We found that participants with more individualist orientations were more subject to perceived intractability and more likely to demonstrate climate change inaction than those with more collectivist orientations. Moreover, the mediating role of perceived intractability in relations between individualist/collectivist status and climate change inaction was also confirmed.</p>
