<p>Belief in Climate Change (BCC) was measured with the three-item scale developed by 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Vainio and Paloniemi (2013)</xref>. This scale asked participants if they agreed or disagreed with three statements: “Climate change is an unstoppable process; we cannot do anything about it,” “The seriousness of climate change has been exaggerated,” and “Emission of CO
 <sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) has only a marginal impact on climate change.” Participants were asked to answer on a 4-point scale from 1 (
 <italic>totally agree</italic>) to 4 (
 <italic>totally disagree</italic>). Cronbach’s α for this scale was 0.608.
