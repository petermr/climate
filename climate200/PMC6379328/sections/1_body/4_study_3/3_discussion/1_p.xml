<p>The results of Study 3 indicate that individuals with a more individualist orientation rated climate change more intractable and reported a greater incidence of climate change inaction than did individuals with more collectivist orientation. Further data analysis showed that the perceived intractability plays a mediating role in the relationship between individualist/collectivist status and climate change inaction. The findings were consistent with our hypothesis. Therefore, we infer that there are individualistâ€“collectivist differences in climate change inaction, which may contribute to the level of perceived intractability of climate change.</p>
