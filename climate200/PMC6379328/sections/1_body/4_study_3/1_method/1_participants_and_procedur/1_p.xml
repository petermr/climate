<p>The initial sample included 788 freshmen (148 women, 640 men; age ranging from 17 to 23) from Zhejiang Ocean University. Participants were initially recruited for the Chinese Values Changing Survey (CVCS) conducted in August 2017, which was planned to trace changes in values annually from 2017 to 2020 among Chinese adolescents. All participants were instructed to finish a battery of questionnaires online at the time of the survey, including an individualism–collectivism measure. Specifically, individualism–collectivism was assessed by a 16-item scale. This version of the scale was derived from the Individualism–Collectivism Scale (

The participants responded to 16 items on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
