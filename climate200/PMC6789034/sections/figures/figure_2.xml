  <p>Error histograms for three temperature indicators as MMT. 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold> Respectively show the error distributions of MFT as MMT, the 78
   <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature as MMT, and annual mean temperature as MMT. By comparing the errors of using three temperature indicators to represent MMT, MFT is proved to be a better indicator. 
   <bold>a</bold> Using MFT as the surrogate for MMT, the locations with an error of less than 1 °C account for 
   <bold>a</bold> proportion of 71%, which is much higher than using the 78
   <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature (44%, 
   <bold>b</bold>) and the annual mean temperature (13%, 
   <bold>c</bold>) to represent MMT
