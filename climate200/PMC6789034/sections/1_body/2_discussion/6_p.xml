<p id="Par22">This study has some limitations. First, similar to all global analyses, our data was not available for every country. Our study regions did not cover the tropical desert, plateau mountain, and cold climate regions. Notwithstanding, because these three missing regions have very small resident populations, our research results could provide a reference for the vast majority of populations in the world. Second, the collected MMTs of the 420 locations were obtained from different studies, and the effect factors and parameter specifications considered in their models are not all the same. We acknowledge that the different parameter specifications could cause uncertainties. However, many studies conducted sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of their findings, and the analyses indicate that, the results were only slightly different for the different parameter specifications. Third, based on the association between MMT and MFT in the present, and the changing trend of MMT over time, we estimate the MMTs in the future. However, whether the future MFT can represent the future MMT is dependent upon the speed with which MMT tracks the changing MFT. There are still uncertainties regarding the speed of human adaptation to temperature in the future. Nevertheless, this limitation exists in all studies on future projections, because we all don’t know what will happen in the future. And our method provides a possible future scenario to improve the projection for future temperature–mortality associations.</p>
