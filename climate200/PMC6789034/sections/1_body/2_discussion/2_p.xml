<p id="Par18">Our findings make an important contribution to the research on climate and human health. Humans adapt to climate in several ways, such as physiological, behavioural, and technological adaptations

 </sup>. First, this study reveals that MFT is a good indicator that reflects an important aspect of how humans physiologically adapt to ambient temperature. Although the MMT changes geographically, it is significantly associated with the local MFT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Darwin’s theory of evolution states that: ‘species have evolved principally via natural selection, and living forms evolved to improve them to better fit with the environment’. And human biological evolution is a process of pursuing self-advantage

 </sup>. In the daily mean temperature histogram for a given year, MFT is the temperature that humans are most exposed to and, therefore, physiologically acclimatise to. Acclimatisation to the MFT may be considered as the pursuit of self-advantage maximisation in terms of temperature. In addition to physiological acclimatization, the socioeconomic conditions can affect human’s behavioural and technological adaptations to ambient temperature. Some studies have confirmed the conclusion
