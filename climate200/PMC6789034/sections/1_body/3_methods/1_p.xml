<p id="Par26">The MFT of each location was obtained by calculating the mode of daily mean temperature distributed in the 54
 <sup>th</sup>â€“92
 <sup>th</sup> range during the entire year, which is the 95% distribution of the MMPs. We systematically analysed the distribution of the MMTs, annual mean temperature, 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature and MFTs in 420 locations from 30 countries. We compared the two existing indicators (annual mean temperature and 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature) and the new indicator (MFT).
