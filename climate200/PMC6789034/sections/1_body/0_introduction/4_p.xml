<p id="Par6">To fill the above research gap, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE for articles published in English from January 2000 to October 2018 using the terms temperature or heat, and death or mortality. Time-series regression or time-stratified case-crossover models combined with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM)

 </sup> are currently deemed as appropriate approaches to estimate temperature effects and provide comparable results. Thus, to ensure the results are comparable, we only investigate empirical MMTs that are modelled by DLNM. A total of 210 papers investigated the relationships between daily temperature and human mortality counts for non-external causes using the DLNM method. Excluding the literature from the repeated study areas, 16 papers
