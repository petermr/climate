<p id="Par7">Here, by analysing MMTs in these 420 locations, we found that although the MMT changes geographically, it is very close to the local MFT in the same period. Based on the MFT~MMT association, we estimate and map the global distribution of MMTs in the present (2010s) and the future (2050s) for each 0.5° × 0.5° grid.</p>
