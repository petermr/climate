<p id="Par3">Ambient temperature, an important environmental factor, affects human health in various ways. Many studies reveal that the associations between temperature and human mortality counts for non-external causes exhibit U-shaped, V-shaped or J-shaped curves

 </sup>, with the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) reflecting the most comfortable, optimum temperature. Mortality rates increase at temperatures outside the local MMT. Identifying the MMT has important practical implications for the investigation of the relationship between temperature and mortality, the definition of non-optimum temperatures, and the calculation of the mortality burden due to exposure.
