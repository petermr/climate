<p id="Par12">We compare the errors of using MFT, the 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature and annual mean temperature to represent MMT. The results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) show that the mean error between the MFT and MMT of the 420 locations is only ~0.9 °C (95%CI = 0–3 °C). If using MFT as the surrogate for MMT, the locations with an error of less than 1 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C account for a proportion of 71%, 85 and 92%, respectively. This is much higher than using the 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile temperature and the annual mean temperature to represent MMT, and the proportions of their errors within 1 °C are only 44 and 13%, respectively. These results show that MFT is a very good indicator of MMT. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> shows scatter plots of these three indicators and MMT. From Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, we can see that MFT and MMT match best. Their fitting curves almost passes through the origin, with a slope of 1 and
