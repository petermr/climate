 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that MMT varies considerably across the planet. Among the 420 locations, the highest MMT reached 32 °C, while the lowest MMT was only 12 °C. When moving from low latitude to high latitude, MMT tends to decrease gradually. The mean MMP of the 420 locations is the 78
 <sup>th</sup> percentile, and 95% of the MMPs were within the 54
 <sup>th</sup>–92
 <sup>th</sup> range.
