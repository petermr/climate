<p id="Par16">Based on the above conclusion—that the association between MFT and MMT is not changed when we adjust GDP/capita, annual mean temperature, latitude, and study year—we predict that with the changing climate, the future MFT can represent the future MMT. We proceed on the assumption that this prediction is correct, and then estimate the global distribution of MMTs in the present (2010s) and future (2050s) for each 0.5° × 0.5° grid. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the distributions of changes of MFT in the 2050s compared to the 2010s under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We can see that under the two scenarios, almost all land regions will experience increased MFT from the 2010s to 2050s. The grids with elevated MFT account for 94 and 96% of the total grids, with the global average MFT increasing by 1.1 °C (95%CI = 0–2.5 °C) and 1.8 °C (95%CI = 0.3–3.2 °C), respectively. The greatest increased values will occur in the mid- to high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest value reaching 4.5 °C. The changes are more rapid under the RCP8.5 scenario than the RCP4.5 scenario.
