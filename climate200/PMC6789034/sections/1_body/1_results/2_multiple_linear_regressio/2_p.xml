<p id="Par10">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows that Model 1 displays the lowest AIC and highest 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>. The adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> of Model 1 is 0.86. In addition to this, we found that if we only use MFT (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>) as predictor (Model 2), the predictive ability is as good as model 1 (the adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.84). Model 2 performs much better than that of using annual mean temperature (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>2,</sub> adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.51; Model 3), 78th percentile temperature (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.60; Model 4), and latitude (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>4</sub>, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.28; Model 5), respectively. The coefficients of Model 1 are shown in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. From Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, we can see that the association between MFT and MMT is not changed when gross domestic product [GDP]/capita, latitude and the study year are adjusted. Therefore, to present a simplified model for practical use, we recommend using Model 2 to predict MMT.
