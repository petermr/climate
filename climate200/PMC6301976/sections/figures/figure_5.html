 <caption> Predictions of % coral cover in Sesoko Island, southern Japan, with high lambda =  0. 03 9 (Equation  2) for sea-surface temperatures predicted under climate-change scenario RCP 8.5 Wm −2 (i.e., 3.7 °C) and high gamma =  0. 005 (Equation  1a) and low epsilon =  3 (i.e., with low intensity of thermal anomalies). The left graph shows the results of 1000 model runs as a heat map, the right graph shows the resulting coral cover estimates in 2100 as a frequency distribution, and the red dashed horizontal lines are 95% credible intervals on the model output distributions. </caption>
