 <caption> Predictions of % coral cover in ( a) Sesoko Island, southern Japan and ( b) Scott Reef, Western Australia under climate-change scenario RCP 8.5 Wm −2 (i.e., 3.7 °C) with thermal stress return periods input under high frequency (6 years) with high lambda = 0.039, high gamma = 0.005, and high epsilon = 8. The left graph shows the results of 1000 model runs as a heat map, the right graph shows the resulting percentage coral cover estimates in 2100 as a frequency distribution, and the red dashed horizontal lines are 95% credible intervals on the model output distributions. </caption>
