<p id="Par3">The rate of recovery from a disturbance is a function of a systemâ€™s stability and resilience

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,

 </sup>. Stable, resilient systems recover rapidly; whereas unstable, non-resilient systems recover slowly, or even collapse after disturbances

 </sup>. Moreover, the slowing of recovery usually indicates that a system is deteriorating and may be approaching a critical threshold, beyond which the system switches to an alternate and often undesirable state

 </sup>. Indeed, understanding the rates of change and the resilience of systems has become central to our understanding of modern ecology
