<p id="Par14">The intervals between thermal-stress events were extracted randomly from a Poisson distribution, with values selected between 3- and 9-year intervals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and the duration of each thermal-stress event was randomly selected from a gamma distribution lasting anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks over any given summer period. Because seasonal irradiance is unlikely to vary among years

 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">2</xref>) on temperature increases between the years 2000 and 2010, therefore λ (Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">2</xref>) was set to zero for the initial iteration (Table
