<p id="Par8">To estimate the parameters in Equation 1, we first estimated recovery rate (
 <italic>r</italic>) and carrying capacity (
 <italic>K</italic>). We obtained data sets of coral cover from two geographic regions: Sesoko Island, Okinawa, in southern Japan
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>, and Scott Reef in Western Australia
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Total coral cover estimates were obtained from Sesoko Island from 1997–2010
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. The corals at Sesoko Island experienced an anomalous thermal-stress event in 1998, which was driven by the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which reduced coral populations significantly

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. The Sesoko Island reefs also experienced a milder thermal-stress event in 2001 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In Western Australia, Gilmour 
 <italic>et al</italic>., see ref.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, collected data on total cover, and the cover of dominant reef-building genera, including 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> and 
 <italic>Porites</italic>, from Scott Reef from 1994–2010 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The reefs also suffered coral losses during the 1998 anomalous thermal-stress event (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
