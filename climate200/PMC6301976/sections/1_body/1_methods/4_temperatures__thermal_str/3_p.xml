<p id="Par12">To estimate the distribution of the frequency of thermal-stress events of each category of El Niño, the number of years in between the start of each event was calculated. The mean, median, and standard deviation of the period in between the anomalous-thermal events were also calculated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The frequency of extreme events in the model simulations was drawn from a Poisson distribution where the rate parameter was estimated from the mean of the frequency of thermal-stress events of categories 1–3 (i.e., between 3 and 9 years). The historical record shows that very strong thermal-stress events occurred every 21.7 ± 9 years (median = 18) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); therefore very strong events were excluded from this study because the infrequent return period lowers the confidence in these events for our relatively short timeframe (to the year 2100).
