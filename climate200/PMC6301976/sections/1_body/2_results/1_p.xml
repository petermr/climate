<p id="Par15">The estimated carrying capacities (
 <italic>K</italic>) were similar between reefs, at ~53% in southern Japan and 64% in Western Australia, although uncertainty, that is the 95% credible intervals, was greater for the reefs in southern Japan than for the reefs in Western Australia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The recovery rates, or the intrinsic rates of increase, of the coral populations were higher in southern Japan (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.39) than in Western Australia (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.17), again with considerably greater uncertainty for southern Japan than for Western Australia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The recovery rates of 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.19) were higher than the recovery rates of 
 <italic>Porites</italic> (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.09) in Western Australia, with similar uncertainty intervals for each genus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Under modern temperature conditions with intermittent temperature anomalies, the model predicted that both geographic localities maintained relatively high coral cover, near their carrying capacities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The predictions for 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> and 
 <italic>Porites</italic> varied, with 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> populations showing greater fluctuations through time than 
 <italic>Porites</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) in Western Australia.
