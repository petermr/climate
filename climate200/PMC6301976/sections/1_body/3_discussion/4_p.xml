<p id="Par20">Secondly, the data used to parameterize the model showed that coral populations in the two locations recovered at different rates. Coral recovery is dependent on numerous conditions, including recent history and what remains on the reef, and the period of recovery between thermal-stress events

 </sup>. Indeed, the capacity of a population to regrow from remnant fragments has a considerable impact on the recovery rates of coral populations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. For example, small isolated remnants of massive 
 <italic>Porites</italic> species regrow rapidly after disturbances
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, but isolated remnants of corymbose 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> species rarely regrow
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, corymbose 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> populations are mostly dependent on larval recruitment for population recovery, whereas massive 
 <italic>Porites</italic> can regrow from local remnants. These differences were reflected in the high variance in the 
 <italic>Acropora</italic> response, compared with the lower variance of 
 <italic>Porites</italic> response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Recovery on a particular reef also depends upon the location of the nearest larval source. Scott Reef is considerably more isolated than Sesoko Island, which is adjacent to Okinawa where remnant coral populations survived through the 1998-thermal stress event. Isolation may have played a role in the differences in recovery rates between Scott Reef and Sesoko Island.
