<p id="Par24">Notably, the model found characteristic bifurcations when temperature anomalies increased in both intensity and frequency. These bifurcations indicate that there is some uncertainty in reef responses to thermal-stress events, which may lead to either reef recovery or collapse. That collapse may be, in turn, dependent on specific thresholds, beyond which recovery is unlikely. The thresholds and bifurcations may also offer an estimate of just how little atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> it takes before ocean temperatures drastically increase a coral populationâ€™s probability of collapsing.
