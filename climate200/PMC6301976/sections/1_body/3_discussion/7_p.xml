<p id="Par23">Although carrying capacities, or equilibrium points, on coral reefs have rarely been quantified and discussed, coral-reef habitats do vary in their carrying capacity. For example, Gouezo 
 <italic>et al</italic>., ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>, recently showed long-term stability on the reefs of Palau, with the greatest differences in coral cover being apparent among habitats. Over a 15-year period, the nearshore reefs of Palau at 3â€‰m depth supported ~50% coral cover, whereas the outer reefs supported on average 40% coral cover, and the patch reefs supported on average 20% coral cover

 </sup>. In the present study, the carrying capacities (
 <italic>K</italic>) were similar, but were higher in Western Australia (64%) than in southern Japan (53%), although there was considerable variance around the means. This similarity should not be entirely surprising given the considerable overlap of the coral species composition, and the similarity of habitats between regions (van Woesik, pers. obs.). Yet, carrying capacities depend on numerous interacting processes, including exposure to waves and sedimentation rates. Although these processes have been rarely explored, we need further studies that more accurately quantify carrying capacities of coral reefs across habitats, and that determine the extent to which climate change is influencing those carrying capacities.
