<p id="Par17">Forecasting when and where thermal stresses will occur is particularly challenging because of stochastic fluctuations in short-term inter-annual climatic cycles, and because of regional differences in both the ocean temperature and the rates of change in ocean temperature caused by global warming

 </sup>. Still, while such short-term climate events are unpredictable in any given year, they are predictable over the course of a decade or more. Our model captured that predictability by using Poisson distributions that randomly selected years with anomalous thermal stress. Although the actual years when thermal-anomaly events will take place in the coming century are unknown, the intensity and frequency of the events used in our models are realistic enough to predict the responses of the coral populations through time.
