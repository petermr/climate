<p id="Par25">Thermal anomalies are becoming increasingly common. Especially prominent were the recent back-to-back bleaching events on the northern and central Great Barrier Reef in 2016 and 2017

A rate of less than r = 0.38, or its discrete-equation equivalent of lambda 1.46, may indicate that the system is deteriorating and that the corals have already passed a critical threshold and lost their capacity to recover

 </sup>. Our model shows that coral populations are most sensitive to both the intensity and frequency of thermal-stress events, rather than to incremental ocean warming. However, ocean warming is likely to increase both the intensity and frequency of thermal-stress events. These thermal anomalies also may become more frequent outside of El Niño events

 </sup>, considerably shortening recovery periods. These temperature thresholds, and the recovery rates of coral populations, are solely dependent on the rates of future greenhouse-gas emissions. Therefore, to ensure the best coral - recovery rates, greenhouse-gas emission rates need to track RCP 6.0 or lower.
