<p>The studies discussed so far addressed shifts in baseline (average) temperatures, yet climate warming also leads to a higher incidence of unusual short-term warm spells.

On the other hand,

While the impact of a summertime heat wave or drought was insignificant or moderate, respectively, strong impacts were observed when heat and drought coincided (as is often the case naturally), both in the short (De Boeck et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and longer term (

The finding that a climate extreme led to legacy effects regarding plant cover and community composition years after the original event, highlights that climate change can cause significant impacts in cold biomes other than through long-term changes in mean conditions.
