<p>Experiments are powerful tools for establishing cause-effect relationships and testing specific hypotheses regarding climate change impacts, but researchers should be aware of the limitations of different methods and techniques (e.g., De Boeck and Nijs,

They concluded that differences exist especially regarding the rate of colonization by new species, which is more rapid in whole-community transplantation studies compared to experiments employing open top chambers (OTCs).
