 <italic>in situ</italic> study of the impact of climate warming on the freezing tolerance of the only two naturally occurring vascular species in maritime Antarctica (
 <italic>Colobanthus quitensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Deschampsia antarctica</italic>). Their results show that temperature increases can lead to a reduction in freezing tolerance, highlighting the complexity of warming effects and the importance of phenotypic plasticity in coping with climate change. In a transplantation experiment,

This encompassed mostly convergence toward optima found in the local, pre-adapted plants when transplants were moved to warmer conditions. The authors note that the extent and importance of trait plasticity is species-specific, as was also reported in the study of

 <italic>Viola biflora var. rockiana</italic>. For this species, the key to survival under climate warming seems to hinge on being able to avoid competitive effects from the surrounding community. Both studies demonstrate that climate change is likely to lead to range contraction and extinction especially for those Himalayan alpine species that are unable to adjust important traits, unless competitive exclusion is avoided by management intervention (e.g., mowing or grazing). The declining species richness in response to warming observed by
