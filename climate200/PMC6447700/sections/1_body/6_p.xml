<p>The interactions between warming and changes in precipitation were further explored by 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.01790" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Li et al.</ext-link> Their experimental study on the Qinghaiâ€“Tibetan Plateau showed that responses to warming very much depended on concomitant changes in precipitation: drier conditions led to a general deterioration of the grassland (especially due to lower productivity), while wetter conditions increased biomass production while preserving forage quality. It is thus critical for sustainable management of these systems that local precipitation trends and variability are taken into consideration in decision-making (e.g., setting maximum grazing intensities). In cold biomes, snowmelt timing is highly important for the onset of the growing season (Klein et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Some regions may face lower winter snowfall under climate change (Gobiet et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), but at high latitudes, the opposite is likely, at least in the near future (Christensen et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This could affect arctic communities both through increased mineralization rates (Schimel et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and changes in the onset of the growing season (Wipf and Rixen, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.01258" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">D'Imperio et al.</ext-link> looked into effects of both increased winter snow amounts and higher summertime temperatures, focusing on root dynamics, which are critically important in these nutrient poor environments. They found that increased winter snowfall and summer warming elicited opposing effects belowground, with the former suppressing and the latter stimulating root growth in this arctic wetland. Because alpine and arctic soils hold important carbon stocks (Hugelius et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), improving our knowledge on belowground dynamics is important in determining changes in the carbon balance.
