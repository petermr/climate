 <caption>
  <p>Diagram of the stGAM method to estimate the associations of anthropogenic stressors (human population density) and climatic stressor (temperature) with the local extinction probability (presence or absence) of mammals. For each grid of each speciesâ€™ distributional range, only data of 2 sampling years were used (i.e., the sampling year of presence and absence). The absence year (i.e., extinction year) was 1 y after the last observation. The presence year was the year 50 y before the absence year. The average value of stressors of the last 50 y before the sampling years of presence or absence was used to examine their associations with the local extinction probability (presence or absence) of mammal species of this grid.</p>
