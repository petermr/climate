 <caption>
  <p>Temporal variation of the survival rates, cropland coverage, human population density, and temperature for the 11 mammal species or groups of species at the county or prefecture level. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Survival rates (percent, i.e., the proportion of survived grids compared to all distributed grids in history) of 11 large mammal species or groups of species caused by local extinctions in China (the same below). (
   <italic>B</italic>) Average cropland coverage (percent, from AD 900 to 2000). (
   <italic>C</italic>) Average human population density (HPD, persons per km
   <sup>2</sup>, from AD 900 to 2000). (
   <italic>D</italic>) Average summer air temperature (degrees Celsius, from AD 900 to 1999). Time resolution was 10 y after 1700 and 100 y before 1700. Different colored lines represent the survival rates (
   <italic>A</italic>), or average cropland coverage (
   <italic>B</italic>), average human population density (
   <italic>C</italic>), and average summer air temperature (
   <italic>D</italic>) of the 11 mammal species or groups of species in their distributed grids.
