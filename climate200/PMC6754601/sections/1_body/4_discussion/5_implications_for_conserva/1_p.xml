<p>In this study, we assessed the associations of human and climatic factors with the local extinction of 11 mammal species or groups of species in China and estimated their local extinction sensitivity to human disturbance and climate change. The results derived from the study should have important implications for the conservation of mammal species in China and elsewhere. Because current global warming was associated with increased local extinction of gibbon, macaque, snub-nosed monkey, tiger, and water deer and would probably force them to move out of their favorable habitats, imposing high risk of local extinction, it is necessary to expand their nature reserves into high altitudes or latitudes. Because human disturbances have consistently been a primary factor causing local extinctions of mammals, it is essential to reduce the impacts of human disturbances, such as cultivation, hunting, deforestation, and grazing, on endangered species. The constructed response curves of local extinction of the study mammals to human population density can be useful in evaluating the local extinction risk of these mammals in a protected region or national park; human access should be kept below that level to ensure long-term survival of these mammals. Habitat fragmentation caused by humans would have an interactive effect with climate change, which could accelerate extinctions (particularly for elephant, panda, rhinos, and water deer) driven by climate change. A 1 Â°C increase or decrease could drive large mammals to move approximately 150 to 200 km toward the north or south (

 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) are not large enough (75% &lt; 471 km
