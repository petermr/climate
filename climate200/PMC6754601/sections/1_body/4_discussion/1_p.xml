<p content-type="flushleft">By using long-term historical records in China, we found large-sized mammals showed larger and earlier population decline than small-sized mammals over the past 2 millennia, and all mammals showed precipitous population declines since the Qing Dynasty (approximately 1644). We found that both intensified anthropogenic and extreme climate change were associated with increased local extinction of the 11 studied mammal species during 1700 to 2000. The local extinction sensitivity of these mammals to change in human population density was similar, except for elephant, which had a very high sensitivity, while the local extinction sensitivity to temperature change was much larger. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of historical extinctions of mammals and should have important conservation implications, as discussed below. However, due to the limitation of our historical data (e.g., uncertainty of historical records, biased recording efforts in space and time, and various spatial or temporal resolutions) conclusions should be cautiously interpreted, particularly for species with a small sample size.</p>
