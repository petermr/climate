<p>Current climate change influences species survival in a given area (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The potential association of climate change with local extinction is estimated to vary from 0 to 54% with an average of 7.9% (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Previous studies indicated that both climate warming (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and cooling (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) could cause range shifts and local extinction of animals, but quantitative evidence is rare.
