<p>Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) reported that rapid range shifts of species were significantly associated with elevated global warming. Such a warming-induced range shift would increase local extinction of animals. We found that the local extinction of gibbon, macaque, snub-nosed monkey, tiger, and water deer was positively associated with temperature in the warm phase (and gibbon, macaque, and tiger also showed a general positive association with temperature for the whole period; 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is expected that global warming during the modern period would expand the northern boundary of these mammals. However, owing to massive habitat destruction and human encroachment in the modern period, animals were not able to expand their range under global warming. Instead, they were forced to leave their favorable but fragmented habitats and faced a high risk of extinction. Li et al. found that temperature and human disturbance had interactive effects on range shifts of the Asian elephant and the rhinos (

Global warming could force the Asian elephant and the rhinoceros to move north or east, but this trend has been impeded by intensified human activities. Although tiger and musk deer were widely distributed, tiger was found to occur in 8 provinces of southern China until the 1990s (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). There are 5 tiger species or subspecies living in different climate zones, and they could suffer extinction pressures under climate change as a whole. For example, climate cooling may have contributed to large extinctions of tiger subspecies in the west and north of China during the cold premodern time, while recent global warming might contribute to the complete extinction of tigers in southern China.
