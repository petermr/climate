 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the effects of human disturbances on local extinction of animals have rarely been quantified. We found that intensified human disturbance was associated with increased local extinction probability for most mammals during 1700 to 2000 (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), except for a few species, probably owing to their small sample sizes (camel,

 <italic>n</italic> = 74) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). After 1644, especially in the modern period, human population density was positively associated with local extinction of most mammal species in China. Over the past 3 centuries, all of the mammals studied showed a sign of a catastrophic population crash (except snub-nosed monkey, macaque, and musk deer), likely associated with increased human populations (

 </xref>). According to the estimates of local extinction sensitivity in

  <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Table S3
 </ext-link>, we found that if the human population density reached 400 persons per square kilometer within a grid, the mammals we studied suffered a local extinction sensitivity of 34.54 to 99.37% within a period of 50 y (

This quantified local extinction sensitivity to human population density could have useful conservation implications for assessing the degree of human impacts on the long-term survival of these mammal species.
