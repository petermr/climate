<p>High human population density is also linked to extensive poaching and road kills, habitat loss due to agricultural cultivation (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), deforestation, and other land-use changes at the local scale (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). During the past 3 decades, China has experienced a rapid increase in population, as well as industrialization and urbanization, thus imposing great pressure on these mammals. High population density not only destroyed habitats of animals via increasing cropland coverage and deforestation but also poached large mammals for food and medicine or deterred the mammals by grazing livestock. Previous studies suggest that human disturbance may cause local extinctions of elephant, rhinos, and panda based on indirect evidence on the relationship between boundary contraction and population density (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Rhinoceros have been extensively hunted by people in the late Pleistocene (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The remains of rhinoceros have been found in 78% of anthropogenic sites (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Hunting and poaching for the horn and habitat loss by logging or land conversion to agriculture have accelerated the range contraction of the rhinos (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and tiger (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Currently, 76 to 80% of nonhuman primate species in South and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Previous studies indicated that gibbon is highly vulnerable to forest loss and hunting caused by human population expansion (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our study provides quantitative evidence of human disturbance driving local extinction of these mammals.
