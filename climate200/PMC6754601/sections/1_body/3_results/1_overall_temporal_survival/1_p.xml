<p>In this study, 9,365 occurrence records of 11 mammal species or groups of species in 1,364 grids were identified in China, including camel (

 <italic>Elephas maximus</italic>), gibbon (genus 
 <italic>Hylobates</italic>, 
 <italic>Nomascus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hoolock</italic>), horse (genus 
 <italic>Equus</italic>), macaque (genus 
 <italic>Macaca</italic>), musk deer (genus 
 <italic>Moschus</italic>), panda (
 <italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>), rhinos (genus 
 <italic>Dicerorhinus</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhinoceros</italic>), snub-nosed monkey (genus 
 <italic>Rhinopithecus</italic>), tiger (
 <italic>Panthera tigris</italic>), and water deer (
 <italic>Hydropotes inermis</italic>) (

In the following, we refer to the 11 species or groups of species simply as “species” unless there is a necessity to distinguish them. As shown in

 </xref>, before the Qing Dynasty (before 1644), the survival rates (proportion of survived grids) of rhinos, elephant, and panda dramatically decreased due to massive local extinctions, while the other mammal species showed a minor decrease in survival rate. During the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1911, the premodern period in China) and the modern period (after 1911), all mammal species (except for snub-nosed monkey, macaque, and musk deer) showed large decreases in survival rates. Cropland coverage slowly increased before the Qing Dynasty but rapidly increased during and after the Qing Dynasty (

 </xref>). Human population density was low and stable before the Qing Dynasty but increased rapidly during and after the Qing Dynasty, particularly in the modern period after 1911 (

 </xref>). Temperature (as measured by average summer air temperature) steadily decreased until the end of the Qing Dynasty then rapidly increased after the Qing Dynasty (

 </xref>). The decreasing trends in survival rate of these mammals were significantly positively correlated with cropland coverage (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) and human population density (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) during AD 0 to 2000 but not with temperature (
 <italic>n</italic> = 38) during AD 900 to 1999 (
