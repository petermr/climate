<p>Using spatialâ€“temporal generalized additive model (stGAM) analysis, we found that human population density (representing the human disturbance) had a significantly positive association with the local extinction probability of elephant, gibbon, macaque, musk deer, panda, rhino, tiger, and water deer during 1700 to 2000 (

The local extinction sensitivity of these mammals to human population density ranged from 42.11 to 63.53% for the premodern period, with the order of water deer &gt; musk deer &gt; rhinos &gt; macaque &gt; tiger and from 34.54 to 99.37% for modern period with the order of elephant &gt; musk deer &gt; gibbon &gt; water deer &gt; tiger (
