<p>Cropland coverage, defined as the proportion of cropland area (percent) in each spatial grid, and human population density, defined as the number of persons per square kilometer in each spatial grid in a given time from the History Database of the Global Environment (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), were used to represent human disturbances over time (AD 0 to 1700, 100-y resolution; AD 1700 to 2000, 10-y resolution). Because human population density and cropland coverage are highly correlated, we only used human population density for modeling local extinction probability. The Asian summer (June through August) average temperature reconstructions (the only available high temporal resolution matching our species occurrence data) over the past 1,100 y (yearly, 900 to 1999), based on 357 publicly available proxy climate data (tree-ring-dominant) series from the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology archives, were used as a proxy of temperature change (downloaded from

Because we are interested in the association of changes in the local temporal temperature with local extinction of these mammals, it is necessary to remove the effects of variation in regional temperature. To do this, the temperature series of each grid was standardized by (temperature âˆ’ mean)/SD.
