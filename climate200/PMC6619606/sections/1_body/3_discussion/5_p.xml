<p>Our study is not a novel model revealing updated climate projections or expectations by 2050. Instead, our analysis is intended to illustrate how complex climate data can be effectively summarized into tangible information that can be easily interpreted by anyone. Of course, the climate scenarios that we have used are based on predictions from a few climate models, run under a single (business as usual) climate scenario. We recognize that these models are characterized by huge amounts of uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and the predicted Future Cities may change as these Earth System Models are refined, in particular in light of urban climate specificities [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, our results are likely to reflect the qualitative direction of climate changes within cities and so meet our primary goal, which is to communicate predicted climate changes to a non-specialist audience in order to motivate action. When model projections are updated, we would recommend communicating any new results with this goal in mind.
