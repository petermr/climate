<p>Our findings also support previous studies conducted in Europe [

 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and north America [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], stressing the current trend of north-to-south geographical shift across the northern hemisphere. Yet, using an optimistic climate change scenario, we found that the velocity (i.e. the speed of geographical shift) risks to be higher in the near future than in the second half of the 21th century [

 <sup>-1</sup> to 20 km year
 <sup>-1</sup>. Our study also allows the extension of such observations to the global scale, showing that observations for Europe can be generalized for the entire Northern Hemisphere and for a part of the southern hemisphere (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At the global scale, our study reveals that geographical shift tend to converge towards the subtropics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217592.g004">Fig 4</xref>), going to warmer climate conditions from boreal and temperate regions and to drier conditions from tropical regions. While this lends support to previous observations of a “tropical belt widening” due to the expected warmer conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0217592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it also shows that tropical biomes tend to shrink in many areas due to drier conditions. We therefore suggest here to refer to a “sub-tropical widening” compared to the previous “tropical widening” due to climate change.
