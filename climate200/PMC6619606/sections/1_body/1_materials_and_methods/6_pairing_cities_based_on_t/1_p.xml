<p>Euclidean distances (i.e., dissimilarity indices) were calculated for every combination of Current and Future City based on their coordinates within the multivariate space defined by the first four principal components axes, creating a symmetric dissimilarity matrix with pairwise comparisons for all cities (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217592.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Three cities are kept for each Future city in order to facilitate comparison between Current and Future climate, as all cities are not necessarily known by the reader. To avoid un-realistic shifts or shifts due to pixel mismatch between Current and Future climate conditions, the final analysis was performed keeping shift values between the 5
 <sup>th</sup> and the 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentile, i.e. keeping 477 out of the original 520 cities.
