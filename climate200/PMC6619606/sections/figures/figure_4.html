 <caption> Latitudinal shift of cities relative to their distance to the equator (in degrees). Cities below 20 degrees North/South tend to move away from the equator (positive latitudinal shift) while cities beyond 20 degrees North/South tend to move closer to the equator (negative latitudinal shift). Cities are colored according to the aggregated ecoregion of the world [ 36] to which they belong, with the tropical in red, the subtropical in orange, the temperate in green and the boreal in blue. </caption>
