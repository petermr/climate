<p id="Par3">The objective of this study was to assess the uncertainty introduced by WG-based downscaling when applied to projections of future climate. The analysis targeted scenarios centered on 2040 derived from two GCMs and two RCPs as well as the baseline period for multiple sites worldwide. As it is recommended to make multi-comparison studies using different WGs

 </sup>, we compared three stochastic WGs: LARS-WG

 </sup>, WeaGETS

 </sup> and CLIMAK
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. The choice of the WGs was based on software accessibility and usability, as well as on the availability of complete documentation. The generated weather series were characterized using an extended set of weather indices and were used to feed a simulation model for rice yield estimates under baseline climate and future projections. Among available crops, rice was selected because of its importance as staple food for more than half of the worldâ€™s population.
