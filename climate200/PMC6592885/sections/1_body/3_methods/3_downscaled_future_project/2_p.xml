 </sup>, which has horizontal resolution of 1° latitude by 1.25° longitude and 32 vertical layers. As well, HadGEM2-ES is a coupled Earth System Model, used by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 centennial simulations. It comprises an atmospheric GCM at 1.25° (lat) × 1.875° (lon) horizontal and 40 km vertical resolutions, and an ocean GCM with a 1° horizontal resolution (increasing to 1
