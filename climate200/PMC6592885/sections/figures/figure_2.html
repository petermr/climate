 <caption> Climate change impact on rice yields (% compared to the baseline) estimated with the model WARM for different combinations weather generator (WG) × representative concentration pathway (RCP) × general circulation model (GCM) at eight sites distributed worldwide. sites are also labelled according to ISO 3166 standard. WGs are CLIMAK (C), LARS-WG (L), and WeaGETS (W). Scenarios indicate combinations of two GCMs, HadGEM2-ES (H) and GISS-ES-R (G), and two RCPs, RCP4.5 (4) and RCP8.5 (8). </caption>
