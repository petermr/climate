  <p>Agreement between generated and reference baselines. Line colors indicate weather generators (WG; C: CLIMAK; L: LARS-WG; W: WeaGETS), whereas line style corresponds to sites. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Overall fit of weather series for each index (one monthly index for each axis with code labels as reported in Supplementary Information); solid black lines indicate perfect fit to reference data. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Distribution density of the fit of all the indices analyzed (the closer to one, the more the whole set of reference distributions is reproduced by the WGs).
