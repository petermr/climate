<p id="p0060">Data (responses recorded by participants on sticky notes) were analysed following a grounded-theory approach using thematic coding (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2014</xref>). Grounded theory seeks to draw information from data, rather than fitting them to a pre-conceived categorisation. Themes in the data are identified by thematic coding, for example, identifying that several contributions relate to data quality. Themes are then compared and contrasted to identify underlying characteristics linking them into broader categories relevant to the research question. In this way, categories are grounded in (derived from) the original data, ensuring relevance and openness to emerging issues (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Charmaz, 2014</xref>). Qualitative approaches have been widely used to investigate the views, perspectives and characteristics of agricultural stakeholders (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mitter et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 2017</xref>) but, to a lesser extent to explore agricultural research processes themselves. Exceptions include 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Reed et al. (2014)</xref> who used a grounded-theory approach to identify key principles of knowledge exchange in environmental management, and 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kipling and Ã–zkan et al. (2016)</xref> who analysed questionnaire data to reveal discourses underlying the perspectives of agricultural modellers on the challenges to communication with stakeholders. These examples demonstrate the practical value of grounded theory in revealing underlying patterns in complex topics.
