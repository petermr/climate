<p id="p0075">A recent review of challenges for Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) for adaptation policy (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al., 2018</xref>) offered a comparison between the data from the current study, and challenges identified within a discipline focussed specifically on CC adaptation, but which encompasses change in all sectors (not only agriculture) and which may, but does not necessarily, draw on modelling. This comparison could therefore, reveal or expand on challenges related to CC adaptation itself that modellers may not have considered. Themes were identified in the review using thematic coding, following the method applied to the data from the workshops (2.1). The themes defined in this process were then compared with the themes derived from the current study to identify similarities and differences. A second set of comparisons were made between workshop data and two recent reviews of modelling challenges in the context of CC; for grassland modelling, and for animal health and disease modelling (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ã–zkan et al., 2016</xref>). These two articles were chosen as they applied a similar approach to that used here in order to derive the challenges they presented, allowing a straight comparison with the themes identified in the current study. The disciplines of grassland and health and disease modelling lie within the broader agricultural modelling community focussed on in this study, but the reviews reflected on CC in general, only briefly treating CC adaptation. They could therefore be used to reveal which of the challenges from the current study were also wider challenges for modellers, and therefore not specific to CC adaptation modelling. In the context of a wider review of literature on CC adaptation, triangulation of these different comparisons was used to draw out specific CC adaptation challenges for agricultural modelling.
