<p id="p0095">Many participants raised issues that related to how modelling could and should be interpreted and applied. Some considered the need to highlight different outcomes “
 <italic>Adaptation to protect ecosystem services – social context – motive of farmers (values, policy context, market failure, etc.). Demonstration of importance of these services</italic>” while others viewed modelling as part of a wider process “
 <italic>Demonstrate use of modelling in participatory projects</italic>” with the capacity to alter the focus of stakeholders and also of research “
 <italic>Modelling imagined situations to produce simulations can draw attention to a problem and stimulate the data production required to improve such estimates</italic>”. While these comments view the role of models as stimulating understanding and interest, others focussed on how to fit findings to users' needs “
 <italic>Policy makers are asking ‘How do we do X?’ while scientists are answering ‘What happens if?’ questions – this can create communication problems</italic>” and “
 <italic>Understanding of the requirements of key players (policy, farmers)</italic>”. Some specific interests believed to be important for stakeholders were highlighted, along with the challenge of tailoring outputs to specific conditions “
 <italic>Cooling, ventilation: Adaptation designs are very farm-specific, e.g. requirement for a very detailed design and approach</italic>”. Other comments considered how stakeholder engagement and model relevance were related “
 <italic>Actors (e.g. farmers) have to be involved in the research pathway from the beginning in order to co-design research questions and co-develop win-win adaptation strategies</italic>“. A final element was the challenge of communicating findings, which may be related to the complexity of the results “
 <italic>Distinguishing between descriptive forecasting and prescriptive (normative) information and results</italic>” or the skills of modellers “
 <italic>Talking is important - modellers can put too little effort into communication skills</italic>”. Some participants suggested ways to overcome communication barriers when sharing results, e.g. “
 <italic>Incorporation into media products like animated films</italic>“. The Use of models category therefore has both pragmatic (What do stakeholders want? How to communicate?), and normative (What should be modelled and explored?) elements.
