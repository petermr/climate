<p id="p0105">A distinct capacity-related element in responses referred to the data on which models rely. A particular focus was issues relating to data on the impacts of future CC conditions on modelled systems “
 <italic>Lack of data for forage crops response to fertilizer under varied extreme event conditions</italic>”, future climatic conditions “
 <italic>Focussed climate scenarios needed (e.g. northern Europe is likely to face wetter conditions and heat stress is not an issue)</italic>” and the likely adaptive behaviour of stakeholders “
 <italic>Data on risk perception of farmers: are they likely to use the strategy, why? Past experiences?</italic>”. There was awareness that data issues often related to a lack of interaction between researchers in different regions and disciplines “
 <italic>There are examples of systems in extreme climates: We in north western Europe have little sense about them or data that may exist on them</italic>” and to variation in available data quality “
 <italic>Heat stress modelling work requires wider data availability to capture differences in impacts between regions (EU database). Some variation between countries can reflect differences in data quality and availability, rather than real differences in conditions</italic>”. The need for data about projected futures was raised, and particularly limitations in approaches to gaining such information “
 <italic>Subjective expert knowledge on 'probability' of events and shocks</italic>”. Comments on data sometimes focussed on the need for better data sharing systems “
 <italic>Inventory of modelling and experimental work to allow better access to available information</italic>” and barriers to this “
 <italic>Often one of the limits is parties holding onto data and models to protect their turf and/or obtain cash and rights</italic>”. Again, the underlying thread in this category was how tackling CC adaptation created a need to overcome the constraints of fragmented research structures.
