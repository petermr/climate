<p id="p0110">Comparing the challenges identified here with those defined for crop modelling by 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Rötter et al. (2018)</xref> (
 <xref rid="appsec3" ref-type="sec">Appendix C</xref>) no new challenge themes were discovered, indicating data saturation in relation to the themes and categories derived from our workshop data. Challenges from 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Rötter et al. (2018)</xref> aligned with a subset of six of the 18 themes identified from workshops. The article also discussed the use of model ensembles to tackle issues related to uncertainty, with this topic treated as an aspect of progress rather than a future challenge. If included as a challenge to modelling, this topic would be accommodated within the ‘uncertainty modelling’ theme identified in the workshop (
 <xref rid="appsec3" ref-type="sec">Appendix C</xref>). As the article included specific challenges for modelling tropical plant production, the fact that no new themes were revealed also provides an indication that the themes presented here are also relevant to adaptation modelling in non-European contexts, although specific challenges within themes are likely to vary. Further investigations of challenges to modelling other non-European farming systems would be important to confirm this wider applicability of the categorisation presented.
