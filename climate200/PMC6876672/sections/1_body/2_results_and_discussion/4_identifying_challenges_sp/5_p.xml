<p id="p0160">Related to the progressive nature of CC, and adaptive responses to it, a second key characteristic of CC adaptation was revealed explicitly in workshop data. Modellers expressed the need to better understand and incorporate likely stakeholder choices under progressive CC in which their expectations and experiences of CC evolve over time, distinct from likely responses to other types of change (such as one-off shocks or opportunities to increase efficiency). One participant, for example, highlighted the importance of understanding “
 <italic>Reasons or other triggers for farmer decisions on the number of cattle they have and the type of grassland management they apply, and the point when they begin to care about climate change and take action</italic>”. Addressing this issue, which contributes to the adaptation-specific elements ‘Optimisation’ and ‘Information’ (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) of challenge themes in groups C and D in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, requires the development of CC adaptation scenarios which are relevant to likely future conditions, and which provide data about the context of decision making and (depending on the type of model) define at least some aspects of decision making itself. Constructing adaptation scenarios is complex, not least because of the issue of path dependency in iterative adaptive responses to progressive CC, discussed above. In addition, choices are likely to be affected by dynamic changes in stakeholder understanding as conditions change (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anwar et al., 2013</xref>). Data for scenarios may come from social science models or, be gathered from stakeholders or experts, and will therefore incorporate 
 <italic>Uncertainty</italic>. In addition, data needed for scenarios includes information on the likely efficacy and impacts of adaptation strategies themselves, which can also be considered to be CC adaptation-specific. Given that participants in the current study highlighted the limitations to the data on adaptation efficacy, including relating to reliance on expert views, 
 <italic>Uncertainty</italic> about the likely effectiveness of CC adaptation strategies can also be considered an adaptation-specific challenge within the cluster of challenges relating to Information available for model development, testing and use (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, D). However, uncertainty relating to models themselves is common to modelling in general, while issues around the quality of data from climate models are important for both adaptation and CC impact modelling (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cammarano et al., 2017</xref>). Scenario development therefore brings together the CC adaptation-specific elements of 
 <italic>Data availability and quality</italic>, 
 <italic>Uncertainty</italic> and 
 <italic>Novel scenarios</italic>, as ‘Information on adaptive responses to progressive change’ (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, D).
