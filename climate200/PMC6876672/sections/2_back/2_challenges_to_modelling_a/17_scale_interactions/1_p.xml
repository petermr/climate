<p id="p0275">The theme consists of challenges to modelling how change at one scale affects that at another, including the need to predict the farm-scale impacts of wider changes: “Not possible to model landscape adaptation strategies such as creating synergies between districts for producing feeds where it is more feasible: How to assess the impacts at farm-scale?”. And the importance of scaling up detailed farm-level modelling to provide regional scale predictions: “Upscaling issues e.g. modelling at farm scale and […] impacts at landscape scale”. Participants highlighted how such effects cross the boundaries between economic and biophysical modelling: “Need to start with farm-level adaptations. Farmers may observe regional water issues and pay for own storage, or find it better to reduce water dependence by using different crops etc.”</p>
