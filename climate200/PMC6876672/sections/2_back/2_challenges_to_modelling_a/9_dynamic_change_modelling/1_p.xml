<p id="p0235">Adaptations can be implemented in different ways, which are likely to influence how they affect the system, and this presents a challenge for modelling: “Solutions can be applied in many different ways (gradually, in one step, in a series of steps – ‘timeframe of choices’) so that the dynamism of adaptation represents another level of complexity for modellers”. At the same time, biophysical processes themselves may occur over different (short- and long-term) time scales, which can be hard to capture: “Short term (eg annual) versus long term (eg decadal) simulations, e.g. soil carbon, soil organic matter (long term dynamics) not well addressed”.</p>
