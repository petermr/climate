<p id="p0255">This theme refers to the challenge of understanding and then modelling the decision to implement change – what factors (values, knowledge, age, economics) influence these stakeholder choices, and how can these be incorporated into models: “Adaptation is related to the perception of farmers and their sensitivity to change in a specific aspect of management (e.g. they are likely to be more willing to change some practices than others). The uptake of adaptation measures is therefore dependent on culture and knowledge as well as external risk”. Differentiation was made between reactive and proactive change: “Farmers have to face actual events, not the risk of events. After such events a range of actions will be required for a system to recover; these represent ‘reactive’ adaptation, which is not the same as pre-emptive adaptation to reduce future impacts”. With a question as to how biophysical models can incorporate adaptation when choices to adapt are made in advance of biophysical triggers to change: “How do biophysical models include the costs of anticipatory strategies?”.</p>
