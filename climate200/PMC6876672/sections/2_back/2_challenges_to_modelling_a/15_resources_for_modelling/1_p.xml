<p id="p0265">This theme covers three main areas. 1) The way that models develop over time, and how this affects their capabilities (e.g. if some parts are based on older research) and the capacity of their users to understand them: “Some model limitations come from the development of models over time. For example, [MODEL NAME] was developed when it was only technically possible to send management information to the biophysical model in (what now seems) a limited way. Management experts then moved on to other projects, and [MODEL NAME] became more biophysical”. Especially when the agricultural modelling field may not have the space to nurture many careers: “Agricultural systems modellers: very narrow resource pool, very different funding, too few can form a career at the coal face - many just pass through”. 2) Issues relating to computability, and the need to incorporate more and more complexity while handling the trade-off with usability: “Computability: To integrate inter-dependent: sectors, scales (spatial) ecosystem services, scales (temporal) adaptations, future scenario space, uncertainty etc.”. Finally, modelling resources may not be distributed equally across specific topics, and this unevenness may not reflect the importance of individual topics in relation to adaptation: “With disease, endemic diseases are more important than incursions, but less attractive to funders (e.g. liverfluke)”.</p>
