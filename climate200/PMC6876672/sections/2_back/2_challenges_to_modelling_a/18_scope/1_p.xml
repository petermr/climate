<p id="p0280">This theme focuses on the extent to which models cover different regions and systems “Difficulties in modelling Mediterranean grassland systems dominated by annual self-reseeding species: the majority of models were developed for temperate grasslands (mainly dominated by perennials”. Elements of systems: “Demonstrate how biodiversity impacts productivity, e.g. by showing influence of pest predation on yield, and impact of beneficial fauna on this: Acceptance and better understanding of feedback effects between production, biodiversity and ecosystem services (societal value)”. And the extent to which they are able to span (or take into account) interactions between biophysical management and economic elements of change, which are central to understanding adaptation: “Biophysical models ignore economic life; e.g. if all farms use more imported feed, then feed prices will rise, people will move out of farming, and animal prices will fall. These are important interactions requiring anticipatory actions by farmers to minimise costs”.</p>
