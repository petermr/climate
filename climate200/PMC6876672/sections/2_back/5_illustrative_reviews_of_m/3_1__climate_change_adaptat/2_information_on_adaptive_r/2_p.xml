However, validation based on observed behaviour may not reflect future choices under progressive CC. In addition, lack of knowledge about the future availability and quality of alternative inputs (e.g. concentrate feeds) may limit the ability of modelling at farm-scale to apply relevant scenarios. Studies using the bio-economic farm-scale model FSSIM (
