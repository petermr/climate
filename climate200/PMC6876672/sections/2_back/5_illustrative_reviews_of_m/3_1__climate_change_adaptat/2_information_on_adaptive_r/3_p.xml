<p id="p0425">A range of approaches exist for increasing the accuracy of predicted behaviour in farm-scale bio-economic modelling (
 <xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Reidsma et al., 2018</xref>). Some maintain assumptions of rational, profit maximising behaviour, but include impacts of uncertainty and changing experience in decision making processes, such as the use of Discrete stochastic programming (
