<p id="p0405">A second issue raised within the Sardinian study, was that dairy cow systems with access to irrigation were predicted to be less affected by CC than more traditional sheep systems. Choices made by policymakers presented with such evidence, would depend on how the modelling message was framed, and what was valued in that framing (e.g. economic benefit, ecological footprint, tradition and culture, tourism or agriculture, the interests of a particular sector). Modelled impacts might therefore drive adaptive responses in very different directions, changing who is affected by climate change, and how (

In highlighting how models can shape stakeholder views and agendas, the data from this study illustrate how modellers might alter what stakeholders consider in their choices. This issue might be addressed by considering how to make researchers more accountable for their influence on decision-making, or by ensuring that, by representing the agendas of the affected as well as the affecting, and by expressing the limitations to their work, modellers can enable stakeholders and policymakers to retain responsibility for their actions.
