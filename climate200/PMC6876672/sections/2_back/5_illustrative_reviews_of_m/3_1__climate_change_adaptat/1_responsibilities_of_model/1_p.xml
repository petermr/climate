<p id="p0400">Recent integrated modelling initiatives have demonstrated the use of agricultural modelling within a process in which model outcomes provide the basis for exploring the broader impacts of change, beyond those normally incorporated in agricultural modelling. In Sardinia models revealed likely reductions in summer sheep's milk production under CC; considering this, researchers and stakeholders explored potential consequences for the supply chain and other economic sectors (

Lower milk production would reduce availability of cheese for tourists, while reduction in milk quality could cause problems for transformation into products with a quality label. One issue exemplified by this study, is that of limitations and uncertainty in modelling. Available statistical heat stress models were not able to incorporate adaptive responses, demonstrating the importance of clearly communicating the meaning and limitations of results to avoid misuse. Such limitations include uncertainty about CC impacts and adaptive responses. The use of impact (

Uncertainty makes developing sound protocols for adaptation modelling vital in preventing model misuse and reducing the potential for incorrect or misinterpreted outputs to drive mal-adaptive change (
