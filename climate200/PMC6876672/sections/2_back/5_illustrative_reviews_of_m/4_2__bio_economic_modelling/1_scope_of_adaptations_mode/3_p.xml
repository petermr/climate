Regional ILMs based on a normative concept of adaptive decision making, such as some linear programming models assuming profit maximization (

 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Kirchner et al., 2016</xref>) have the scope to model novel land use outcomes (e.g. new crop species or the adoption of new technology) although this requires prior specification of the measure by the user – this is particularly challenging in regional ILM due to their large spatial and farming system coverage. Regional ILM based on positive concepts of adaptation decision making, such as positive mathematical programming (PMP) models (

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Fezzi and Bateman, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Moore and Lobell, 2014</xref>) may face challenges in representing adaptation beyond previously observed ranges. An option to overcome this limitation is the incorporation of observed management practices from other regions, where climatic conditions are similar to those expected in the focus region under CC. In terms of representing future technologies,

For ILMs, further research is required to understand adaptation outcomes when relationships between farms, supply chains, and marketing of agricultural products are taken into account.
