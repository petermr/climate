<p id="p0435">To characterise how adaptation affects biophysical processes, farm-scale bio-economic models rely on either, inputs from biophysical models (from one-off data input to integrated frameworks) or the creation of simpler endogenous representations of biophysical systems. The scope of adaptation strategies they characterise is therefore constrained by the scope of these linked models, including in relation to the objectives of adaptation strategies, with most crop models focussing on yield rather than other types of outcome (
