<p id="p0455">While some adaptation requires binary decisions (e.g. whether to establish cover crops on a plot), other decisions can be continuous (e.g. the choice of fertilisation levels or irrigation rates). ILMs frequently link single models sequentially and are static with respect to land use decisions, rarely representing feedbacks of adaptation choices on CC altered biophysical systems. Consequently, they are limited in relation to evaluating how the costs and benefits of adaptation strategies evolve over time. Modelling of dynamic adaptation processes such as applied in bio-economic farm models is complicated by the larger spatial and farming system coverage of ILMs. Even for market feedbacks, many applications use exogenous price assumptions on agricultural inputs and outputs independent from adaptation choices. In regional ILMs, adaptation thresholds are mainly determined by economic cost-benefit considerations â€“ a considerable simplification from real-world decision making. One-off investment decisions can be modelled by comparing average costs and benefits (e.g. represented in annuities) but this requires assumptions about the dynamic effects of adaptation strategies such as transition periods. Options to overcome challenges relating to optimisation under progressive change include risk sensitive dynamic modelling of annual land use decisions (

Abstracting from the farm level in regional ILM eases the representation of transformative shifts between farming systems, such as land cover conversion, changes in livestock, or between organic and conventional farming systems. However, static models are prone to overestimating the likelihood of dynamic transformation processes (e.g. forest succession); including risk behaviour, as in many bio-economic farm models (
