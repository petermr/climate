<p id="p0450">Dynamic bio-economic farm-scale models such as ScotFarm can represent inter-temporal dependencies (e.g. agronomic effects of adaptation via changing rotations or herd management or the financial aspects of longer term investment and policy and/or market changes). Agronomic thresholds can be incorporated into farm-scale bio-economic models either via the functions of specific modules (e.g. linked crop models) or external data input. However, incremental adaptation can only be assessed if relevant processes are integrated or if data are provided from external models (

Economic thresholds (e.g. farms going out of production due to losses) can be represented, although financial modules often work at the gross or net margin level, not considering reserves and credit availability. To the extent that alternative practices can be characterised, step changes in management and in contextual scenarios can be compared, including the impacts of long-term financial investment (which can be annualised over the investment's lifetime to make them comparable).
