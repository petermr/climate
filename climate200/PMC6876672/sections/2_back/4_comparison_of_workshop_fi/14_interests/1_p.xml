<p id="p0360">Individuals and groups vary in how they respond to risk and the types of risk and types of things affected are likely to be qualitatively different, so that attempts at ‘objective’ comparisons can lead to choices that are suboptimal in terms of people's needs (e.g. irreversible changes, value related to attachment to places and systems with cultural significance). The interests of some groups may trade-off with those of others, and may be sub-optimal when considered more broadly (e.g. policy drive to incentivise food production over environmental protection). Priorities may also link to deeper underlying values that may not be explicit. These issues create a challenge at points where objective CCRAs and subjective perspectives interact. Taken together, the issue of interests raises the important issue of who should be involved in determining the scope and nature of CCRA and the extent and type of response, given that those making choices may not wish to take precautions.</p>
