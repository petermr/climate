<p id="p0320">The need to better incorporate into CCRA information on the viability of adaptation options, and on the way their effectiveness varies with different scenarios of future change (sensitivity in the context of uncertainty). Lack of data is an important limitation to CCRA, for example relating to monitoring or evaluation of adaptation options, to biophysical systems, their responses and the impacts of human actions on them, and on adaptive capacity. There is a need for improved data quality to move on from piecemeal and/or qualitative/subjective assessments (e.g. expert judgements or stakeholder exercises) to systemized data collection, appraisal and presentation. Monitoring and evaluation data are in many cases limited in terms of survey size and sample type (e.g. only early adopters). Consistency is needed in framing risks and uncertainties and the criteria on which adaptations are evaluated needs to be considered (see also under ‘ethics’). Approaches have been developed and used to apply global data to more localised CCRA, to overcome some challenges relating to a lack of data.</p>
