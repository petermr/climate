<p id="p0385">Uncertainty can limit action if adaptation is undertaken only in the light of predictions. However, predictability is suggested by some authors to be more important when there are few alternative options for action and relative certainty in outcomes – this is not the case with climate change. Uncertainty may relate to consequences or likelihood of climate change impacts or in relation to the effects of adaptive actions. In relation to climate change, much uncertainty is probably irreducible. Therefore, ‘wait and see’ is not a positive strategy. Some authors have suggested that uncertainty can be used as knowledge in itself, affecting how the viability of different options for change is viewed. Questions are raised about whether reducing uncertainty increases the effectiveness of decision making, although the importance of providing boundaries to potential outcomes are emphasized by some. Having a range of scenarios – including extremes – may assist decision making under uncertainty and being explicit about the goals of adaptation is also important. Involving stakeholders in participatory approaches to change based on precautionary principles can be a more effective path for decision making with unavoidable uncertainty than using metrices and making decision trees. Other approaches include incorporating the temporal aspects of change (e.g. dynamic adaptation pathways with trigger points, robust decision making approaches, and risk layering according to risk and return periods) and stress testing to assess critical levels for ecosystem functioning in natural systems.</p>
