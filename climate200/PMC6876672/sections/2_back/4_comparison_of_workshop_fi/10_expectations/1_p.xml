<p id="p0340">Decision makers are expecting more from CCRAs, including for example information on the adaptive impacts of current policies and assessments of how to make adaptations more effective. Some examples of CCRAs used in practical policy processes include the climate risk index for Italy which used detailed ensemble modelling and analysis to rank administrative areas according to the risks they faced in relation to specific climate change impacts. Outcomes informed the distribution of financial resources for adaptation. Those using CCRAs need to recognise that complete avoidance of risk is not likely to be practical. Engaging throughout the process of CCRA can help build understanding and reduce differences in expectation between those producing and using the CCRA.</p>
