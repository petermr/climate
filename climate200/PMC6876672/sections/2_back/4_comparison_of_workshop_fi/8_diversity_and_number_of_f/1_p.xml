<p id="p0330">Diversity is present in i) the context of adaptation, including the perspectives of those involved, what they value or feel concerned about (different types of change and impact, different timescales of change), ii) the diversity of evidence types on which CCRAs must be based, iii) the different underlying assumptions, uses of scenarios and scope of CCRAs, iv) the diversity of risks and adaptive options which means that fitting risks into strict technical parameters for CCRA may not be appropriate. Large numbers of options are also likely to be available for adaptive change.</p>
