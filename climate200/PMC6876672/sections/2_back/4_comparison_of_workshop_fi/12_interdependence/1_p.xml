<p id="p0350">Challenge to understanding i) how risks cascade through interdependent systems (biophysical and human) and ii) how adaptive actions on the ground, policy and risk levels interact. In relation to i) work is needed to better understand linkages and critical transitions within systems (including biophysical-human system interactions). Such interactions and the incorporation of multiple time scales are beyond conventional RA methods but need to be understood to address systemic risks. Using expert stakeholder knowledge can provide a route to understanding how risks are transmitted across sectors and scales. Risk transmission framing is mentioned as a specific methodological advance in relation to assessing cascading risks.</p>
