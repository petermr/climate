  <p>Comparison of challenges identified by participants with themes drawn from 
   <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger et al. (2018)</xref> and challenges from 
   <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kipling et al. (2016b)</xref> and 
   <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ozkan et al. (2016)</xref>. Within the three categories of Use, Content and Capacity defined from the analysis of data, white and grey boxes indicate challenges identified by participants in the current study: i) listed as wider challenges for modelling in reviews (white); ii) in which some element was considered unique to CC adaptation in reviews (light grey); and iii) considered specific to adaptation in reviews (dark grey). Black boxes = challenges only raised in CCRA review. Asterisks = challenges identified by participants, and also in CCRA review. Dashed ovals delineate groupings of challenges contributing to one of the specific CC adaptation modelling challenges depicted in 
   <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (denoted by letters A-E).
