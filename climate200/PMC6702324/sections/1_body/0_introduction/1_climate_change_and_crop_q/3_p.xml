<p>Plants have evolved secondary metabolites to protect themselves from various abiotic and biotic stressors (Fraenkel, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Coley et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Since the synthesis of secondary metabolites represents a metabolic cost, plants tend to produce these compounds in notable concentrations if they have the ecological cue to do so based on interactions between environmental (Lower and Orians,

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>; Glynn et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Each crop has specific secondary metabolites that characterize crop quality while the presence of other secondary metabolites is viewed as deleterious for crop quality due to off-flavors or toxicity attributes. Climate change factors have resulted in a decrease of multiple secondary metabolites in a range of food and beverage crops including coffee (Villarreal et al.,
