<p>Impacts of climate change on agricultural systems threaten crops with notable implications for farmer livelihoods and human health (Odada et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Pachauri et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Campbell et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Since the 1950s, agricultural systems have experienced gradual systematic changes in average climate conditions including unprecedented multi-decadal warming, increased inter-annual variability of the Earth's surface temperatures, changes in average precipitation, greater weather variability, and more extreme weather conditions (Pachauri et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These climatic changes have decreased agricultural productivity and shifted the geographic range of many crops (Lobell and Asner, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Porter and Semenov, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Concurrently, productivity of some crops has increased with a rise in temperatures (Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) has decreases concentrations of micronutrients zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) as well as protein for C
 <sub>3</sub> grains and legumes (Myers et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). While the literature provides substantial evidence on the impact of climate change on crop yields (Lobell and Asner, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Hertel et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Lobell et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), fewer studies have focused on the effects of climate change on crop quality (Porter and Semenov, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ahmed and Stepp, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
