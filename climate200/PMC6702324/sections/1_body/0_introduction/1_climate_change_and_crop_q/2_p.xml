<p>Crop quality is a multi-dimensional parameter that refers to the nutritional, health, and sensory attributes of crops as measured by the presence, absence, and/or concentrations of phytonutrients, minerals, and primary and secondary metabolites (i.e., bioactive food components or phytochemicals) as well as associated bioactivity, shelf life, and organoleptic properties (i.e., color, visual appeal, aroma, taste, and texture) (Mattos et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ahmed and Stepp, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Secondary metabolites are non-nutrient plant constituents that impact crop quality through an influence on flavor, appearance, stability (Tomás-Barberán and Espin, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and health-promoting attributes including mitigating micronutrient deficiencies (Johns and Sthapit, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and the risk of diet-related chronic disease including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (Liu, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Over 100,000 secondary metabolites have been identified in five chemical classes including phenolics, terpenes, alkaloids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds, phytosterols, and organosulfur compounds (Goldberg,
