<p>This study addresses the aforementioned knowledge gap through a systematic literature review that examines the following question: 
 <italic>What are effects of environmental variation related to climate change on tea quality?</italic> Given the lack of studies examining long-term effects of climate change on tea quality, we synthesize studies that examine the effects of environmental factors that are shifting with climate change. This review can inform future research by identifying literature gaps and new research questions while serving as a model for literature reviews on climate change effects on crop quality.
