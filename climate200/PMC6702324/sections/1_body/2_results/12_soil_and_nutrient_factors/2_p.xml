<p>Although many crop species are inhibited by high levels of soluble aluminum (Al) in the soil, most often found at low soil pH (e.g., pH &lt; 5.0), we found multiple studies that demonstrated that Al stimulates tea growth (Mukhopadyay et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), phytochemical concentration associated with high-quality tea (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Duan et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sae-Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hajiboland et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), or both. Both Duan et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Sae-Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>)found that increasing Al resulted in higher polyphenol, caffeine, and amino acid content of tea leaves; Sae-Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) also noted higher content of catechins with increasing Al, and also with increasing Se. Hajiboland et al. (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) found that Al supplementation could compensate for B deficiency.
