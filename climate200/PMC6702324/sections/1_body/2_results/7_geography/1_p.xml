<p>While geography is not directly changing with climate change, areas that are suitable for agriculture are shifting with climate change. The eight studies examining the effects of geography on tea quality (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) focused on agroclimatic zones, location, and karst topography. Geography was found to notably impact catechins and other tea polyphenols in seven studies (Borse et al.,

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Two studies showed that caffeine varied with geography (Borse et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), two studies showed that amino acids varied with geography (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and no studies showed that volatiles varied with geography. One study found that location notably impacts sensory parameters of tea and that this directly corresponds to higher phenolic theaflavin and therubigin tea constituents (Bhuyan et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
