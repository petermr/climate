<p>The four seasonality studies measuring tea volatiles demonstrated that some volatile compounds increased with the seasonal transition from the spring and/or first tea harvest and that other compounds decreased (Saikia and Mahanta,

This study showed that in general the spring season has a greater number and higher concentration of volatiles associated with high tea quality (Kowalsick et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Three studies showed that caffeine concentrations decreased with a transition from the spring season to the summer monsoon season (Akhlas,

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ahmed et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>) and one study found caffeine to increase during the summer (Saito et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). One study provided evidence of an increase in amino acids with the transition from the spring to the summer monsoon (Saikia and Mahanta, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>).
