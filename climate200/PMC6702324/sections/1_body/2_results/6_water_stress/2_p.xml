<p>One water stress study examined the effect of drought stress on levels of volatile compounds (Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Cao et al. (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) showed that the number of aromatic constituents in fresh tea leaves was highest under a soil water content of 54% (relative to field capacity) and lowest under a soil relative water content of 100%. None of the water stress studies examined the effects of water stress on caffeine levels in tea.
