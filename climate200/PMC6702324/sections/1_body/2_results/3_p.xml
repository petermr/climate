<p>The most prevalent crop quality parameters in the literature addressing the study question were total phenolic concentration, catechin content [including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and catechin gallate (CG)], and antioxidant activity. Other prevalent quality parameters include caffeine, theaflavin, thearubigin, tannins, carotenoids, terpene alcohols (i.e., linalool and geraniol) and other aromatic volatiles, fatty acid composition, chlorophyll, glycoside precursors, proanthocyanidin, and lipoxygenase and glycosidase enzymatic activities. Overall, increases in the aforementioned secondary metabolites is associated with increased crop quality until a specific threshold for human flavor preference when a further increase is no longer considered desirable. Total color, brightness, and flavor of brewed tea were measured as organoleptic quality parameters linked to secondary metabolite concentrations. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and colorimetric spectrophotometry assays were the most prevalent methods for analyzing tea quality.</p>
