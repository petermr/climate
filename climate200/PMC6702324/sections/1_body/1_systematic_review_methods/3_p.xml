<p>A multidisciplinary team of subject experts and a review methodology expert collaboratively designed the systematic review protocol. Specifically, the multidisciplinary team of subject experts included scientists with expertise in the fields of plant biology, chemistry, soil science, herbivory, phytochemistry, biochemistry, agronomy, food science, tea science, and climate change. Establishment of the review protocol involved preliminary scoping of search terms to test the search strategy for indication of the volume of relevant literature. Search terms were identified and revised during an iterative process after examining relevant articles from the search and refining search terms to meet both evidence needs as well as feasibility for a systematic review. Following are the key components of the final search terms that included a combination of tea, environmental factor linked to climate change, and quality parameter: “tea OR camellia sinensis” AND “climate change OR global warming OR season OR solar radiation OR precipitation OR geographic area OR temperature OR soil OR wind OR annual bud burst OR carbon dioxide” AND “antioxidant OR caffeine OR phytochemical OR catechin OR theaflavin OR flavonol OR polyphenol OR secondary metabolite.”
