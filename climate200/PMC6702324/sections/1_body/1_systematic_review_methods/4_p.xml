<p>A total of five publication databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO GreenFILE, Scopus, and, Agricola. Databases were selected that are commonly used to search for articles in the areas of food systems, agriculture, climate change, secondary metabolite chemistry, and human health. Inclusion criteria were restricted to peer-review articles published in the English language from 2000 to 2015. The software program Covidence was used to manage articles identified within the publication databases and was further used for screening of articles. Following the search, the retrieved articles were screened by a review panel of three reviewers (KS, MH, and SA) to minimize reviewer bias in identifying articles for their relevance to the review question using 
 <italic>a-priori</italic> inclusion criteria. Two reviewers from the review panel screened each article. Decision discrepancies (inclusion or exclusion) were discussed by the entire panel for resolution. The final set of articles was critically appraised for their design on focusing on environmental effects on tea quality.
