<p>Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence with mixed impacts on tea quality. A surprising finding was that while many crop species are inhibited by high levels of soluble aluminum (Al) in the soil, we found multiple studies that demonstrated that Al not only stimulated tea growth (Mukhopadyay et al., 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), but also phytochemical concentration associated with high-quality tea (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Duan et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sae-Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hajiboland et al., 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. Farmers can respond at some capacity to climate-driven shifts on crop quality at the level of individual fields or farms. However, beyond specific thresholds, adaptation would require geographic shifts in production, yet these thresholds are largely unknown for crop quality.
