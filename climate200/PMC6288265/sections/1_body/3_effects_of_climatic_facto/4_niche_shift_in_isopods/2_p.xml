 </italic>, a species with worldwide although mainly synanthropic distribution, has proved to be tolerant of temperatures below 0 °C. Its super-cooling point was approximately -7 °C (Tanaka and Udagawa 1993). Active specimens of different woodlice species occur rather often under snow inside the decomposing litter layer in temperate regions. Such kind of abilities might help both the altitudinal and latitudinal dispersal of cold-tolerating species. The expected effect of climatic changes is the shift in distribution limits at least in the case of habitat generalist and synanthropic species. The potential ‘climate change-driven’ northward range expansion of certain terrestrial isopods (and other detritivores) might contribute to the increase of litter decomposition rates. Decomposition rate changes depend mostly not on species composition but on the biomass of macro-decomposers. Increased decomposition facilitates carbon emission (
