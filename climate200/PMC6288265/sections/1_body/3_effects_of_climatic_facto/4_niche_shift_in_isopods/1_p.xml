<p>The niche of an isopod is determined first of all by microclimatic conditions. Michael R. Warburg, as a postgraduate student of G. Evelyn Hutchinson, made the first studies on isopods’ niches. He partitioned an isopod’s niche into two parts (

Nowadays, the niche might be compiled of the effective values of climate/microclimate, resources, intra- and interspecific relations, and all physical and biological factors influencing reproductive output. Very often chemical, physical characteristics of soil, such as pH and/or carbonate content are limiting factors (

The actual microclimatic changes influence the daily activity, diurnal and seasonal rhythm of the populations. Above-ground surface activity and activity density of the populations belonging to different species also depend on their affection to soil temperature, soil moisture, above ground relative humidity and availability of shelter microsites as well. Humid shelters are particularly important during reproduction, egg, embryo development, and manca release to save offspring against dehydration.
