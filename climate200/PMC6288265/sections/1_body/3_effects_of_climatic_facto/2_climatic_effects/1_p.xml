 </named-content> originate from marine ancestors and there is a distinctive gradient within the taxon of increased adaptation to land conditions so that a variety of climatic components could be identified as determinants of speciesâ€™ occurrence, establishment, survival, or prosperity (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Hornung 2011</xref>). In addition, the degree of dependence on such climatic factors may vary through different scales (biomes through regions, to habitats and microhabitats). In general, though, the most critical factors determining terrestrial isopod establishment, existence and survival at any given locality are temperature and humidity. Microclimatic tolerance, niche dimensions of single species or species assemblages are central topics of isopod studies since the turnout of woodlice ecology (e.g., see the works of

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al. 2013</xref>). Protection against desiccation evolved along different routes, such as physiological, ecomorphological and/or behavioral pathways. Evolutionary changes in respiration and respiratory organs, changes in cuticle structure and morphology, conglobation mechanisms and tendency towards aggregation, are all parts of terrestrial adaptations promoting fine and large-scale dispersal (
