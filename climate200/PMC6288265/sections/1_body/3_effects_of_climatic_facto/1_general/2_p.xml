<p>It is already widely acknowledged that climate change has altered the distribution of several invertebrate, vertebrate and plant species. Abiotic environmental factors, first of all humidity and temperature are of basic importance in the life of soil dwelling macro-detritivores, too. Climatic, microclimatic relations strongly inï¬‚uence the abundance, community composition and functioning of soil organisms, including woodlice, and so indirectly decomposition rates and soil macrofauna (
