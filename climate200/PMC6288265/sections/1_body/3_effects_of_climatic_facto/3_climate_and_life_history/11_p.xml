<p>Isopods are excellent objects for anthropochorous distribution and jump dispersal. It is known that a fertilised female can reproduce several times without a successive copulation (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Johnson 1982</xref>). As gravid females carry their eggs/larvae in a brood pouch till hatching, they are saved against unfavorable environmental effects. These small-sized animals can easily be propagated with soils and with ornamental plants (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Hornung and Szlavecz 2003</xref>). Species introduction, a passive dispersal process today assisted mainly by humans, is usually followed by a rapid population increase and then active dispersion. Isopods might be called ‘silent invaders’: introducing a small number of specimens (in extreme cases even one gravid female) may lead to the establishment of a stable, persistent population (
