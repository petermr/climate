<p>Another important behavioural adaptation of isopods towards water loss reduction is the tendency of many species to aggregate (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allee 1926</xref>). Water loss is dramatically reduced by crowding, as shown by several studies on aggregation patterns. Several relevant data have been summarised by 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Broly et al. (2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015c</xref>). Aggregation as a behavioural variation, adaptation can buffer also the effects of changes in microclimate (
