<p>In a recent study, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al. (2013)</xref> could make a generalised statement on the correspondence of water loss, desiccation resistance, and habitat choice. Based on data from 22 species, they found that differences in body water loss rate are the main mechanism behind interspeciÔ¨Åc variation in desiccation resistance. There was a low variation in lethal water loss among investigated species, while water loss rate and desiccation resistance (measured as average survival time in hours) had a significant interspecific variation in connection with ventral surface area, the main vaporiser body part. Other morphological traits such as structure of pleopodal lungs, and cuticle (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Csonka et al. 2013</xref>) are also good indicators for environmental tolerance, influencing habitat choice and distribution. Regional species distribution and habitat moisture levels showed rather clear correspondence evaluating 758 records of 48 isopod species in western Hungary (
