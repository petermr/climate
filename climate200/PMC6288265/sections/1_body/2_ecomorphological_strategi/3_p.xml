<p>A more detailed ecomorphological analysis of isopods is necessary before we can make trustworthy inferences on varying responses to environment among ecomorphs. The ‘non-conformists’ category of 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Schmalfuss (1984)</xref> could be divided into functional morphological categories (e.g., species of
