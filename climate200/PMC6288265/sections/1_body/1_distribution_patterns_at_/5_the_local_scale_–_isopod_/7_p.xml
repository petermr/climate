<p>How can we account for this apparent contradiction regarding the role of habitats for isopod diversity? A plausible explanation lies at the scale of environmental heterogeneity exploited by such species of saprophagous animals. There is often significant variation among isopod species encountered at localities separated even by just a few tenths of meters, depending on the mere occurrence of keystone habitats, regardless of the area covered by the latter (

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Purse et al. 2012</xref>). This means that isopods can exploit heterogeneity at very fine scales, so that disturbance and fragmentation may not affect their species richness, as long as keystone habitats are not eliminated.
