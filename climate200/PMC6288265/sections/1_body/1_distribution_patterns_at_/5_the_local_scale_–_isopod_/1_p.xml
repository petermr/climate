<p>Community composition of a certain functional group may depend on local environmental factors and/or on dispersal limitation. Most terrestrial isopods have highly limited dispersal and dispersion abilities. Most of them are ‘prisoners’ of their special demands regarding shelters. The vast majority of ecological studies on isopods focus at the local, community-level scale. There are studies aiming to document the species composition and abundance of isopods at certain biotopes and/or to examine the temporal changes in community structure and dynamics at a seasonal or inter-annual temporal scale. It is not within the scope of this chapter to present an exhaustive review of this body of research, so we shall try to identify general patterns emerging from these studies that might be of interest for the main theme of the present topic.</p>
