 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Lopes et al. (2005)</xref> explored gradients on elevated sites in Brazil, but the altitudinal range of their study (up to 1000 m a.s.l.) was not large enough to reveal actual effects of elevation on diversity. These authors, though, found a pattern reminding of a ‘mid-domain effect’, with species richness increasing in intermediate elevations, usually between 500–800 m. Suggestive evidence for such a phenomenon has been also found by 
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Warburg and Hornung (1999)</xref> on similar altitudes in Israel. On the other hand, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Giurginca et al. (2015)</xref> showed a decrease of cavernicolous species richness with elevation.
