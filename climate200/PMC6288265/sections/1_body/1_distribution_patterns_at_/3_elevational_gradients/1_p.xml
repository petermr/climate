<p>Another link between different scales can be found in the exploration of elevational gradients. These are assumed to reflect large-scale latitudinal patterns, given that changes in environmental conditions along altitudinal zones are very similar to changes encountered when one travels to higher latitudes. As already stated, isopods can be found even at very high elevations (&lt; 4,800 m), exploiting thus a broad range of mountainous environments and providing very useful case studies on the effects of elevation gradients.</p>
