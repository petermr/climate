<p>At a narrower latitudinal zone and an intra-continental scale, however, a significant latitudinal gradient of decreasing species richness can be seen. In fact, even though we do not have detailed maps of species richness at a fine geographical grain, when species richness of European countries (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) are expressed per area unit (= species density), then one can find an almost perfect linear trend (in logarithmic space) of decreasing density with mean country latitude (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, a study evaluating the latitudinal species richness of ten species-rich (with ≥ 20 species) families in Europe (e.g., 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="family">Philosciidae</named-content>
 </named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="family">Oniscidae</named-content>
 </named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="family">Cylisticidae</named-content>
 </named-content>, 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="family">Armadillidiidae</named-content>
 </named-content>) identified a gradual decrease of species richness towards north which was consistent in almost all families (except 
 <named-content content-type="taxon-name">
  <named-content content-type="family">Cylisticidae</named-content>
 </named-content>) (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Hornung and Sólymos 2007</xref>). It remains to be seen whether these trends hold also true for other parts of the world. In any case, the European trend is in accordance with the tentative global trend discussed above, given that maximum isopod richness is to be found around the Mediterranean region, at low temperate latitudes.
