<p>Based on our experience with these organisms, though, we can assume that increased drought will lead to increased extinction rates for the usually small-sized hygrophilous species through the reduction of available habitat. For example, one of us (SS) has documented the apparent extinction of

On Kythnos Island it was present at just one freshwater spring till 1990. After a couple of dry years in the â€˜90s, the spring dried up and the species went extinct even after the re-appearance of water during subsequent rainy years. An intensification of such phenomena is expected in the near future. On the other hand, in regions where rainfall is expected to increase, the only gain in diversity might come from range shifts and long-distance dispersal (diffusion), but these are slow processes depending also on many other factors (e.g., isolation, distance to be covered etc.). It is interesting to note that this kind of observations provide a direct link between global and local-scale patterns.
