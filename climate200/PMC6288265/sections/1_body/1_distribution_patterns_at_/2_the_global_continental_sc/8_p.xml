<p>Another attempt towards identification of global scale patterns has been made by 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Karagkouni et al. (2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) who explored trends in isopod body size. These authors used maximum body size of females from several hundred non-halophilous and non-troglobious species and also treated separately certain species-rich families. Body size distribution was found to be under strong phylogenetic control, Bergmann’s rule (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann 1847</xref>) and the aridity hypothesis (larger sizes favored in more arid areas as a means to avoid desiccation through lower surface/volume ratio) were only weakly supported, while no support for the ‘island rule’ (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">Van Valen 1973</xref>) could be found. Body size (maybe also body shape; see 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Broly et al. 2015a</xref>) is an important factor for most biological functions (e.g., water loss, respiration, reproduction, brood size). Of course, such effects would be most important at an intraspecific level, since environmental stress towards lower size might lead to decreased reproductive success. Unfortunately, we still lack such studies that would demand exploring links among variation in body size, brood size, reproductive success etc., within the distribution range of the same species. Global trends can provide indications on the mean outcome of the effects of environmental factors on size-related features. The very restricted data at hand indicate an expected pressure towards larger size in regions where temperature and drought are increasing. Nevertheless, it is not very clear whether this means an increased extinction rate of smaller species, a higher reproductive rate of larger individuals within each species, or both. The consequences in each case might be different depending on life history strategies, position along the r-K selection gradient etc.
