<p>Scale is one of the most crucial factors when it comes to distributional patterns. Environmental change too can be perceived quite differently and its effects can vary widely at different scales. Habitat fragmentation, for example, may lead to very different outcomes when it refers to deforestation within a stand of trees compared to the deforestation within a large forest or even, e.g., within the whole Amazon basin. Similarly, climate change at a global scale does not lead to directly analogous changes at local sites or within isopod micro-habitats. Therefore, it is important to study isopod responses to environmental changes at different scales regarding distribution patterns.</p>
