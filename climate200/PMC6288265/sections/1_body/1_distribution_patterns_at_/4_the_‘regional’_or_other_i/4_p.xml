<p>Another useful approach in the frame of this discussion is offered by biogeographical analyses at an intra-country spatial level, like those presented for Mediterranean island groups (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Gentile and Argano 2005</xref>) or the Canary Islands (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez 1991</xref>). These studies have documented in a robust way the importance of habitat diversity for isopod richness. Further analysis at the same scale (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis and Triantis 2009</xref>) has shown that the existence of keystone habitats, like surface freshwater sources, is crucial for the maintenance of isopod diversity. It is not the extent of such habitats that is of importance, but their mere occurrence. This suggests that if we manage to guarantee the persistence of such habitats, we can conserve most of the isopod diversity we have recorded, at least in semi-arid and arid regions.
