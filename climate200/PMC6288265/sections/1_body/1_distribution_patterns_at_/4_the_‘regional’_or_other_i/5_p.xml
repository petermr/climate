<p>In another approach, in an analysis of isopod community composition at different scales from local to archipelagic, 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis et al. (2004)</xref> found that most species occurring at low abundance are local endemics, while the reverse need not be true (i.e., we can find local endemics at a high abundance). Furthermore, local endemics may be sparsely distributed in space, so that a conservation strategy based on a few biodiversity reserves may not be adequate for isopods, or even other invertebrate groups (e.g., see 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis and Legakis 2001</xref>). These findings should alert us against an increased probability of losing local biodiversity in a wide range of areas, not only those officially designed as protected (usually based on endangered vertebrates and/or plants). It might be relevant to this discussion that the recent Red Data Book of Threatened Animals of Greece (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Legakis and Maragou 2009</xref>), based on IUCN criteria, includes 47 species of terrestrial isopods whose distribution ranges hardly overlap (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis 2009</xref>), even if we exclude the troglobious species that are often endemic to a single cave or to a small local cave system.
