<p>Phylogeographic analyses at regional scales have started to appear during the past few years, revealing a strong effect of palaeogeographic history of current distribution of isopod taxa (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Kamilari et al. 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2014</xref>) but also effects of environmental factors such as sea water temperature for amphibious species (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Eberl et al. 2013</xref>) or even evolutionary and dispersal events that may lead to unexpected distribution patterns (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Santamaria et al. 2013</xref>). There are still just a few such analyses so far, but we should expect a rapid raise of their publication rates given the modern advances in molecular techniques.
