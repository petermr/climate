<p>Available information on isopod distribution at geographical scales intermediate between the global and the local are mainly in the form of country lists and, more rarely, evaluations of such lists. A seminal work in this regard is the well-known work of Vandel on the isopod fauna of France (
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Vandel 1960</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>), where the author, in addition to the per species presentation of taxonomy, ecology and distribution, provided also an account of country-level general patterns. 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">Schm√∂lzer (1971)</xref> published a similar work for the Iberian Peninsula, but his biogeographic interpretation was rather elementary. 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Gruner (1966)</xref> also gave ecological and distribution data on the German isopod fauna elements. 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Giurginca et al. (2015)</xref>, in their overview of the cavernicolous isopods of Romania, presented also a short account of the species currently known from the country.
