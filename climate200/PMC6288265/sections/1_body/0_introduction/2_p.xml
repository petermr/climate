<p>Some 15 years after the publication of the world list of all species of terrestrial isopods (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Schmalfuss 2003</xref>, and the updated electronic version in 2004), we still lack a global scale analysis of distribution data. The list presented each species’ distribution at a relatively coarse geographical scale, mostly at country level. Several additional records and taxonomic revisions are published every year (e.g. 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Campos-Filho et al. 2017</xref>), so that today we can estimate a total number somewhat larger than the 3,710 valid isopod species belonging in 527 genera and 37 families given by 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Sfenthourakis and Taiti (2015)</xref> (as per April 2014). It is well known that terrestrial isopods have a worldwide distribution and exploit almost all kinds of terrestrial and coastal habitats, being absent only from polarregions and very high altitudes (&gt; 4,800 m a.s.l. – see 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Beron 1997</xref>).
