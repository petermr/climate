<p>Climate change, of course, is not the only important factor behind on-going environmental change. Besides chemical and organic pollution that might be important in some places, the most important processes for isopods are the homogenisation of agricultural landscapes and the increased urbanisation in many parts of the world. Such habitats are subject to faunal homogenisation processes that favour a small number of adaptable, habitat generalist, isopod species. Even though we have not been able to document decreased levels of local (alpha) diversity in such habitats, overall diversity is negatively affected by decreasing beta-diversity among such localities. Nevertheless, this process has started to attract the attention of isopod researchers only recently, so we still need more data and also from a wider geographical range, before we can evaluate these processes reliably.</p>
