<p>The donations to Gondwana-Link across the different conditions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>. These data were once again analyzed via a 2 (construal level) Ã— 3 (time horizon) ANOVA. There was no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,250) = 0.14, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.71, no significant main effect of time horizon, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,250) = 1.18, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.31, and no significant interaction between the two variables. Although the main effect of time horizon was not statistically reliable, it merits comment that inspection of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> reveals a similar trend to that of behavioral intentions, whereby participants in the past condition tended to register lower donations than in the present and future conditions.
