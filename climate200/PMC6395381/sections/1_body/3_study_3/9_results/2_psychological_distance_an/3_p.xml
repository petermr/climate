<p>The internal consistency of the RCW scale was satisfactory (α = 0.72), although this reliability was attenuated when the internal consistency of the two sub-scales was calculated separately (α = 0.57 for RCW-E, α = 0.60 for RCW-G). The average scores on the two versions of the RCW scale, as a function of the different conditions, can be examined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>. These data were once again entered into a 2 (construal level) × 3 (time horizon) × 2 (RCW: RCW-E vs. RCW-G) ANOVA. There was no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 1.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.25, no significant main effect of time horizon, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 0.70, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.50, and no significant main effect of RCW, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 1.90, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.17. However, there was a significant construal level × RCW two-way interaction, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 4.96, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, η
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.02, which arose because there was no effect of construal level on the RCW-E scale, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 0.09, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.76, but responses on the RCW-G scale were higher in the abstract construal condition than in the concrete construal condition, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 3.28, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07. The remaining two-way interactions and the three-way interaction were all non-significant (all 
 <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.43, all 
 <italic>p</italic>-values &gt; 0.24).
