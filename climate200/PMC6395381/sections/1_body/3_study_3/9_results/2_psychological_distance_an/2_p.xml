<p>The BIF scale was moderately internally consistent (BIF α = 0.51), but with BIF-E (α = 0.33) showing less consistency than BIF-G (α = 0.53). The low alpha was not a result of any single item. The alpha scores were relatively stable in all experimental conditions, except the control condition (BIF-E α = -0.57, BIF-G α = 0.06; for further information see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Information</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> shows mean responses on the BIF-E and BIF-G as a function of the different conditions. These data were subjected to a 2 (construal level) × 3 (time horizon) × 2 (BIF: BIG-E vs. BIF-G) ANOVA. There was a significant main effect of BIF, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 14.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, η
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.05, with larger scores on the BIF-G than the BIF-E, but no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,253) = 0.73, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.39, and no significant main effect of time horizon,

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.78. All of the two-way interactions and the three-way interaction were non-significant (all
