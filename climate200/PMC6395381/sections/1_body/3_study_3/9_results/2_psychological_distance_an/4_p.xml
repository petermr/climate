<p>The last measure we examined as a proxy of psychological distance was time perspective. It is plausible that time perspective would be affected by the temporal manipulations. To this end, we conducted a 2 (construal level) × 3 (time horizon) ANOVA on the time perspective scores. Consistent with the earlier psychological distance analysis, there was no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 0.03, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.85, and no significant main effect of time horizon, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 0.89, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.41, but the interaction between the two variables fell just short of conventional significance levels, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 2.94, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06, η
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.02.
