 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> shows willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviors by condition. As above, a 2 (construal level) Ã— 3 (time horizon) ANOVA was conducted on these data. There was no significant main effect of construal level, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,267) = 0.01, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.94, a marginally significant main effect of time horizon, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 2.37, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09, with participants in the past condition having lower pro-environmental behavior scores than those in the present and future conditions, and no significant interaction between the two variables, 
 <italic>F</italic>(2,267) = 0.52, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.60.
