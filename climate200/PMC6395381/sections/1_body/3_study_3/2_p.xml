<p>Experiments conducted outside the context of climate change tend to show consistent and robust effects: manipulating construal level affects temporal distance, and vice versa (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Trope and Liberman, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Soderberg et al., 2015</xref>), although most studies only looked at timespans of less than a year. In the environmental context, the findings are less clear. In one case, researchers have found exactly what CLT would predict, namely that shifting a temporal horizon to appear closer increases pro-environmental behavior via concrete construals (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bashir et al., 2014</xref>). The aforementioned study manipulated the perceived temporal distance of a future date (e.g., “2020”) by asking participants to mark the year on a horizontal line. The endpoints of the line began in the current year at the time of testing (2010), and ended either in 2025 (2020 future seems distant) or 2085 (2020 future seems close). 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bashir et al. (2014)</xref> found that the manipulation successfully led participants to feel temporally closer to 2020, and that this predicted intentions and reported environmental behavior. Further, the relationship between temporal closeness and reported behavior was mediated by concrete construals of pro-environmental actions.
