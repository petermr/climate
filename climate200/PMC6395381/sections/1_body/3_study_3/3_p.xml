<p>However, the effects reported in 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bashir et al. (2014)</xref> were small and not representative of the general pattern observed in the wider literature. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Rabinovich et al. (2010)</xref> conducted a study in which time perspective was manipulated, and found that people intended to behave more in line with their pro-environmental attitudes when envisioning a temporally distant situation, rather than a temporally close one. 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Roh et al. (2015)</xref> found the opposite; that temporal distance (discussing future consequences of climate change) led to reduced action among Republican participants. In other studies, manipulating the future timing of climate impacts has had no effect in some cases (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Sundblad et al., 2011</xref>), and in other cases produced results that are variable and difficult to explain (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rickard et al., 2016</xref>). The latter study manipulated onset of major climate impacts in a close (New York) versus distant location (Singapore), at three future time points (2020, 2047, and 2066). They found that liberals showed less variability in response to manipulations, but that the highest support for climate policy was from conservatives when climate impacts were spatially close, and temporally distant (New York in 2066).
