<p>Two other measures were included to assess criterion validity. The first measure was time perspective, a distance-related variable that strongly predicts environmental behaviors (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arnocky et al., 2013</xref>). We used the 14-item Consideration of Future Consequences scale (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Joireman et al., 2012</xref>), which contains items such as “I only act to satisfy immediate concerns, figuring the future will take care of itself” measured on a response scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic>very uncharacteristic of me</italic>) to 7 (
 <italic>very characteristic of me</italic>). The second measure was place attachment, a variable that reflects a bond between person and specific spatial locations. As “global attachments”–a feeling of belonging to the entire world–predict environmental action (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Devine-Wright, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Devine-Wright et al., 2015</xref>), the place attachment scale (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Devine-Wright et al., 2015</xref>) was included to test the role of local and global attachments, and their relationship with psychological distance and construal level. This scale measures reported sense of belonging to regions of varying distance from the individual, ranging from one’s neighborhood to the entire world, on a response scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic>no sense of belonging</italic>) to 5 (
 <italic>very strong sense of belonging</italic>).
