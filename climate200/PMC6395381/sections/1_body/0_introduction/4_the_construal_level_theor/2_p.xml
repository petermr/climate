<p>The concept of “perceived distance” as a predictor of behavior emerged in the work of 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lewin (1951)</xref>. Lewin’s work on field theory introduced the idea that human behavior may be understood according to distances and forces perceived between the self and other entities. The entities that can affect our behavior include the people that we know, events that occur, values we hold, future goals, past memories, and so on.
