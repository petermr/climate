<p>Understanding the possible link between perceived psychological distance, construal level, and support for climate action is therefore important, since it may provide insights into ways in which climate change communicators can reduce the perceived distance of climate change by manipulating construal level.

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al. (2015)</xref> in their review of this field, although much research effort has been expended on understanding the link between the perceived psychological distance of climate change and support for climate action, results have been inconsistent. In three studies, we address this issue by systematically exploring the links between psychological distance, construal level, and support for climate action.
