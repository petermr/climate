<p>The research clarifies the role of CLT in the context of climate change action–the CLT proposition that concrete and abstract construals shape perceived psychological distance was not supported. We found evidence that both abstract 
 <italic>and</italic> concrete construals explained variance in policy choice (Study 1, 2) and individual behavior and behavioral intentions (Study 1, 2, 3). This suggests that while psychological distance and construal level affect one another and are linked in other contexts, it is not necessarily the case in the context of climate change. One’s perceived psychological distance from climate change appears unrelated to how abstractly one perceives climate change, a finding that complements other studies reporting that representations of climate change are complex and fluid, and at times simultaneously distant and proximal (
