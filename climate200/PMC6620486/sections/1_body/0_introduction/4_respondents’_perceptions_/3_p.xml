 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) argued that studies on the knowledge and perceptions of climate change and responses have been undertaken as ways to measure and track climate change effects and develop effective and sustainable interventions. Social scientists are able to assess the changing environment of people’s knowledge towards climate and climate-related hazards and disasters. In the 1990s, these studies were anchored on establishing public awareness on climate change, while early efforts were meant to gauge public understanding of climate change causes and effects (Bostrom et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Read et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) together with the associated value judgements (Kimpton et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). In other contexts, studies were to establish respondent characteristics, and associated perceptions and attitudes towards climate change. The relationship had been found to be complex and unclear.
