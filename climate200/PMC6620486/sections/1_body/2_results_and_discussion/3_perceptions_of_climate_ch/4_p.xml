<p>The respondents’ views regarding the current climate status augured well with the existing body of literature on climate change in Zimbabwe. The current climate was not favourable to the respondents as shown by the overwhelming rating, ranging mostly between very bad to extremely bad as compared to the time at settlements. The respondents viewed rainfall as decreasing, while temperatures were increasing together with wind speed, sun heat, drought frequency, floods and dry spells. This was consistent with findings in the literature (Nhemachena et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Simba et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Simba et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) argued that in the study conducted in Masvingo province of Zimbabwe, respondents regarded climate is changing because of the increasing frequency of droughts, dry spells, shifts in rain seasons, rising temperatures, declining rainfall amounts and more frequent mid-season droughts. Households’ views might have been shaped by their interaction with the environment over the years. The correct interpretation of the respondents’ knowledge regarding the environment raised hope in raising the awareness of the community about the health hazards posed by climate change.
