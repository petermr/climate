  <title>Authors’ contributions</title>
  <p>A.N. wrote and conceptualised the article by coming up with the particular title. She had to do more research on the pertinent issues of participants’ perceptions of climate change and health hazards, and finalised the article before submitting it to the journal. M.T. did the initial research and also facilitated the collection of primary data. She also provided empirical evidence through informal observations as she had to organise the meetings with the various stakeholders in Mount Darwin. She also applied for the ethics clearance.</p>
