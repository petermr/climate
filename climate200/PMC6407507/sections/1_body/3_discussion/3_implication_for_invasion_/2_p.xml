<p>Furthermore, our results showed that large changes in temperature seasonality between current and future scenarios may lead to a high potential for IPS to expand in ecoregions (e.g. Montane Grasslands and Shrublands, Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Conifer Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Rivers, and Temperate Coastal Rivers), indicating that we should include temperature seasonality features of ecoregions with high expansion potentials into early-warning monitoring schemes for invasion management. We also need to pay attention to the changes in annual mean temperature within ecoregions. Our results showed that the increasing annual mean temperature may result in a high expansion of IPS in terrestrial ecoregions at a large scale, but the effects of annual mean temperature on plant invasion may depend on the type of biome for freshwater ecoregions. Hence, we could propose detailed references on prevention and control of IPS expansion at a large scale and delineate the regions with a high risk of plant invasion around the world (
