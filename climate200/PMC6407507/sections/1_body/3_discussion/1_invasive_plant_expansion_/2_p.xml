<p>Invasion of IPS has a large potential to result in landscape homogeneity at ecoregional scales. IPS can compete with native plant species and occupy available habitats and resources in invaded ranges at large scales (

 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Price, Spyreas &amp; Matthews, 2018</xref>). Hence, the species richness of native plants would be threatened by IPS expansion. This wide geographical distribution and limited taxonomic diversity of native plants creates greater inherent taxonomic homogeneity due to IPS expansion (

 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Price, Spyreas &amp; Matthews, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, numerous ecoregions are vulnerable and endangered due to biological invasion (
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Olson &amp; Dinerstein, 1998</xref>). Our results have shown that climate change could promote IPS to expand in ecoregions of Northern Europe, the UK, South America, North America, southwest China, and New Zealand, indicating that IPS expansion could lead to homogenisation and biodiversity loss in ecoregions.
