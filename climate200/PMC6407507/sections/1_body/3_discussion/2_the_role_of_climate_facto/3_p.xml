<p>We should pay attention to some southern areas like New Zealand and South Africa, where native plants have little competition strength (

 <xref rid="ref-80" ref-type="bibr">Sheppard, 2013</xref>) have shown that hat local processes (i.e. the biotic resistance of plant communities) are less important than large-scale phenomena (i.e. environmental driving forces), and climate factors are the main forces of plant invasion in New Zealand and South Africa (
