<p>In this work, we evaluate the potential of IPS to expand in global ecoregions under climate change by focusing on two specific questions: (1) where are the regions with the potential for IPS expansion of terrestrial and freshwater ecoregions under climate change; and (2) what are the climatic features of ecoregions with high IPS potential expansion under climate change. To address these two questions, we first used Maxent, a common climatic suitability modelling approach (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">Phillips, Anderson &amp; Schapire, 2006</xref>), to model the climatic suitability of IPS under climate change; second, we mapped the potential of IPS expansion under climate change. Next, we assessed the potential of IPS to expand in terrestrial and freshwater ecoregions based on ecoregion biomes and plant growth forms. Finally, based upon our results, we propose a strategy for invasion management.
