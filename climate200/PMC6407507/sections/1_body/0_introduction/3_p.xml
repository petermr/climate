<p>However, few studies have specified the relationship between IPS expansion and climate change in global ecoregions under climate change. 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bellard et al. (2013)</xref> projected the distributions of 36 of the worldâ€™s worst IPS across different biomes and proposed some management suggestions for invasion prevention and control, however, the number of IPS investigated was limited in this study. To address this knowledge gap, IPS with a wide distribution range and maps of terrestrial and freshwater ecoregions should be utilised to evaluate the potential of IPS to expand in global ecoregions under climate change. Furthermore, assessment of the expansion risk of IPS at the global ecoregion level could provide an important theoretical basis for the prevention and control of IPS at a global scale (
