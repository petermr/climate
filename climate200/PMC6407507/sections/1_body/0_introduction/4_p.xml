<p>Climatic suitability modellings were used to assess the possibility of IPS expansion in global ecoregions under climate change based on climatic niche conservatism (

 <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr">Thuiller et al., 2005</xref>). These modellings have used occurrence records of IPS and climatic factors to assess the distribution of IPS at large scales (

 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bellard et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The use of climatic suitability modellings in biological invasion gives us the new insights into the prevention and control of IPS at ecoregional scales. Niche conservatism, as a key requirement, indicates that species tend to grow and survive under the same environmental conditions in native and invaded ranges (

 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr">Petitpierre et al., 2012</xref>). Similarity in the climate between native and target regions has long been recognised as a basic requirement for successful invasion (

 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we need to attach importance to niche conservatism for plant species. Such a niche conservatism hypothesis indicates a stable climatic suitability of plant species between native and invasive regions (
