 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bellard et al., 2013</xref>) used a fixed threshold to match invasive plant expansion at pixel levels from the results of climatic suitability modellings. However, some studies (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>) have indicated that thresholds are problematic and can produce bias in predictions for multi-species distribution patterns. Here, we used a likelihood approach (
