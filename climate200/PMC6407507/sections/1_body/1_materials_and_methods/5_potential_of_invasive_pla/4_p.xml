<p>Then, we summed the change values of climatic suitability of pixels for multi-IPS between current conditions and the 2080s (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) to quantify the potential of IPS expansion in each ecoregion. In our study, the ecoregions with changes in multi-IPS climatic suitability between the 2080s and current conditions over 0 were included, and the ones with changes less than 0 were excluded. We summed the values of the possibilities for IPS expansion in ecoregions based on the biomes and growth forms. We used a linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between the potentials for IPS expansion in RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 based on each ecoregion biome and growth form. We found that there was a significant relationship between the potentials of IPS expansion in RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (
