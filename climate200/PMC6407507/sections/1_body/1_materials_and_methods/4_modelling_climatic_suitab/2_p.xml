<p>To precisely predict climatic suitability of IPS, we improved the Maxent modelling performance by optimising the analysis settings based on the study by 
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander (2013)</xref>. Specifically, we used the logistic output from Maxent to quantify climatic suitability of IPS under climate change, and we set the regularisation multiplier (beta) to 1.5 to produce a smooth and general response that could be modelled in a biologically realistic manner (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Convertino et al., 2014</xref>). Then, we used a 10-fold cross-validation approach with 90% of the occurrence data used as a training set, and the remaining 10% of occurrence data was used as the test set in each run of 10 replicates to remove bias with respect to recorded occurrence points (
 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>). The modelling output was the average values of 10 replicates in a fold cross-validation approach (

 <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Merow, Smith &amp; Silander, 2013</xref>). Hinge features were used for each variable to make linear and threshold features redundant, forming a model with relatively smooth fitted functions (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Elith et al., 2011</xref>). We set the maximum number of background points as 10,000 to produce pseudo-absences for each IPS, and as much as possible, these background points were close to geographic (and thus environmental) space containing samples of occurrence data to reduce the sampling bias on modelling performance (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>). We obtained background points highly correlated with true probability of presence using the presenceâ€“absence modelling purposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al. (2009)</xref>. The other settings were the same as described in 
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Elith et al. (2011)</xref> and
