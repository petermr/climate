<p>We found that climatic features of terrestrial ecoregions with a high IPS expansion potential (i.e. Montane Grasslands and Shrublands, Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Conifer Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests, and Tundra) had relatively large changes in annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality between current and RCP 4.5 scenarios (

The freshwater ecoregions of high expansion potential (i.e. Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Rivers, Temperate Coastal Rivers, Xeric Freshwaters and Endorheic (closed) Basins, and Montane Freshwaters) may be distributed in ranges with large changes in temperature seasonality between current and RCP 4.5 scenarios. However, climatic features of freshwater ecoregions with a high expansion potential differ depending on a variety of biomes (
