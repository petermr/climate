<p>According to the results of the Jackknife test, we found that the most important climatic suitability variables for IPS were annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S1</xref>), indicating that there was a significant linear relationship between the changes of annual mean temperature between current and RCP 4.5 scenarios and potential of IPS to expand in ecoregions across different biomes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The biomes most affected include the following: terrestrial ecoregions—Rock and Ice, Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); freshwater ecoregions—Xeric Freshwaters and Endorheic (closed) Basins (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For temperature seasonality, we also found a similar linear relationship to annual mean temperature. The biomes most affected include the following: terrestrial ecoregions—Montane Grasslands and Shrublands, Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests, Temperate Conifer Forests, and Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (
