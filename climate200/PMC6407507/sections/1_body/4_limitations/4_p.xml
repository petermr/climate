<p>Third, we made an assumption in the methods, stating that plant species will have stable climatic suitability in their native and invasive regions (

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, we could reduce the uncertainties of niche conservatism of IPS between invasive and native ranges. Future studies should use a more extensive database of occurrence records to improve robustness of climatic suitability modellings for plant invasion assessment across global biomes.
