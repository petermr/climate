  <title>Potential of invasive plant expansion in terrestrial (A) and freshwater (B) ecoregions in RCP 4.5.</title>
  <p>The numbers of this figure represent the degrees of invasive plant expansion potential based on the sum values on change of climatic suitability of pixels for multi-IPS between current conditions and the 2080s (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) at ecoregional levels. Terrestrial represents terrestrial ecoregions; Freshwater represents freshwater ecoregions; Codes used in this figure are defined as follows: For terrestrial ecoregions: BF, boreal forests/taiga; DXS, deserts and xeric shrublands; FGS, flooded grasslands and savannas; IW, inland water; MG, mangroves; MFWS, Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub; MGS, montane grasslands and shrublands; RI, rock and ice; TBMF, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests; TCF, temperate conifer forests; TGSS, temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands; TSCF, tropical and subtropical coniferous forests; TSDBF, tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests; TSGSS, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands; TSMBF, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests; TD, tundra. For freshwater ecoregions: LL, large lakes; LRD, large river deltas; MF, montane freshwaters; OI, oceanic islands; PF, polar freshwaters; TCR, temperate coastal rivers; TFRW, temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands; TUR, temperate upland rivers; TSCR, tropical and subtropical coastal rivers; TSFRWC, tropical and subtropical floodplain rivers and wetland complexes; TSUR, tropical and subtropical upland rivers; XFEB, xeric freshwaters and endorheic (closed) basins.</p>
