 <caption> Fig. S2. Map showing the potential for invasive plant expansion in RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. The colors coupled with the numbers in this figure represent the level of IPS expansion potential across different ecoregions. Blue means there is a very high chance of expansion and tan-yellow means a low chance of expansion. </caption>
