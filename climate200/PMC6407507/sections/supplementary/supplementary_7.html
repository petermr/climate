 <caption> Table S2. The relationships of the expansion potential of IPS between RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios based on logistic values of Maxent. Terrestrial represents terrestrial ecoregions; Freshwater represents freshwater ecoregions; Codes used in this table are defined as follows: For terrestrial ecoregions: BF: Boreal Forests/Taiga; DXS: Deserts and Xeric Shrublands; FGS: Flooded Grasslands and Savannas; IW: Inland Water; MG: Mangroves; MFWS: Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub; MGS: Montane Grasslands and Shrublands; RI: Rock and Ice; TBMF: Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests; TCF: Temperate Conifer Forests; TGSS: Temperate Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands; TSCF: Tropical and Subtropical Coniferous Forests; TSDBF: Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests; TSGSS: Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands; TSMBF: Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests; TD: Tundra. For freshwater ecoregions: LL: Large Lakes; LRD: Large River Deltas; MF: Montane Freshwaters; OI: Oceanic Islands; PF: Polar Freshwaters; TCR: Temperate Coastal Rivers; TFRW: Temperate Floodplain Rivers and Wetlands; TUR: Temperate Upland Rivers; TSCR: Tropical and Subtropical Coastal Rivers; TSFRWC: Tropical and Subtropical Floodplain Rivers and Wetland Complexes; TSUR: Tropical and Subtropical Upland Rivers; XFEB: Xeric Freshwaters and Endorheic (closed) Basins.
