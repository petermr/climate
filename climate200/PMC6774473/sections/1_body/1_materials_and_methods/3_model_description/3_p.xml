<p>Climate change is incorporated by allowing a populationâ€™s carrying capacity (
 <italic>K</italic>) and growth rate (
 <italic>g</italic>) to change over time. The magnitude and direction of changes are estimated using a parameterization process that incorporates available information and expert opinion (see the 
 <italic>Data and climate parameterization</italic> section for more details). We project future biomass, harvest, and profit trajectories for each fishery over a 30-year time horizon under different climate and management scenarios.
