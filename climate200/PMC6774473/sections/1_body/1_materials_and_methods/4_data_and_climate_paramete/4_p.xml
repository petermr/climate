<p>For each environmental driver, we assign a value that represents the expected directional (positive, negative, or neutral) effect of climate change and magnitude (none, low, medium, and high) of that impact on the model parameters based on the expected fishery effects found in the literature review (
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The numerical values assigned to each magnitude of change are a 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% in current 
 <italic>g</italic> or 
 <italic>K</italic> for no, low, medium, and high impacts, respectively. We chose these values because more definitive information on the functional relationship between climate change drivers and population parameters 
 <italic>g</italic> and 
 <italic>K</italic> for these taxa is unavailable. Therefore, we instead assigned values intended to represent an increasing magnitude of change in the absence of better empirical data, and chose values that are conservative. Using a process similar to that of Hare et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we qualitatively assessed impacts for each of the environmental factors for all 25 stocks based on current general knowledge of how climate change will influence species distribution, biology, and physiology (cf., 
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We also took into consideration biological and ecological characteristics of stocks included in this study such as geographical location, longevity, fecundity, and habitat temperature.
