<p>Climate change effects are parameterized using an approach that determines anticipated long-term relative changes in regionally available biomass because of range shifts (incorporated in the model by allowing carrying capacity 
 <italic>K</italic> to change) and the growth parameter 
 <italic>g</italic>. Functionally, allowing carrying capacity to change affects the maximum amount of potential catch available to a fleet. A major assumption in the present work is that fishers will perceive poleward spatial shifts and vertical migrations as a reduction in available fishable biomass or potential catch. Our rationale is not implying that socioeconomic factors affect 
 <italic>K</italic>; rather, that climate change will affect 
 <italic>in situ</italic> abundance or perceived 
 <italic>K</italic> for fleets. We assume that changes in 
 <italic>K</italic> and 
 <italic>g</italic> occur at a constant rate over time.
