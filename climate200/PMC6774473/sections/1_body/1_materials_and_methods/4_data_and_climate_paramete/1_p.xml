<p>We use fishery-specific data and parameters originally developed by Mangin et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222317.s003">S1 Table</xref> for parameter values) to parameterize the current fishery status in this study. Biological parameters were determined using information for the species considered when available or for similar species from other regions when local data were unavailable. Economic parameters were developed using official catch statistics and first-hand price information, as well as estimated cost data [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Detailed descriptions of criteria, data, and information used in assigning values to starting biological and economic parameters are provided in Mangin et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Cisneros-Mata [
 <xref rid="pone.0222317.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
