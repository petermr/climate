 <caption> Comparison of profit outcomes for each stock. Annual profit indicators for two contrasting scenarios relative to the SQ no CC scenario. The Opt policy with climate change results in greater profit compared to the SQ policy (with or without climate change) for all stocks except pelagic red crab, which is one of the only stocks in our study considered to be underfished and experiencing overfishing ( S1 Table), and is also one of the most vulnerable to climate change ( Fig 1). </caption>
