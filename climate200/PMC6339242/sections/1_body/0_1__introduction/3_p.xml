 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Climate variability and change are affecting human health in many Caribbean SIDS, such as Dominica, and proactive adaptation planning is required to prepare individuals, communities, and health systems to manage current and future impacts. For example, Dominica has experienced recent outbreaks of climate-related infectious diseases, such as chikungunya and dengue fever (both viral diseases transmitted by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito), and food production systems in the country have demonstrated sensitivity to gradual climate change as well as climate shocks [

More recently, in September 2017, Dominica was hit by Hurricane Maria, a category five storm, which caused severe destruction across the island. As a result, 31 people died and thousands were injured from landslides and floods. Psychosocial distress was widespread, food security was reduced due to extensive damage to the agricultural sector, and there were significant challenges with accessing safe drinking water [
