<p>In conclusion, wildfires are increasing in prevalence, largely as a result of climate change. Higher temperatures have dried vegetation to produce fuel and concurrent drying of groundwater accelerates combustion. Physicians should note the impact of global warming on human health with regard to fires and heatwaves so they can be attuned to relevant medical conditions and can proactively help their patients.</p>
