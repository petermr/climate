<p>Supporting an association between global warming and wildfire frequency, duration, and devastation, a study by Westerling et al. found strong correlations between wildfire and hydroclimate in western United States (U.S.) forests, indicating that the increased wildfire activity the West Coast experienced over recent decades reflects sub-regional responses to climate change. They discovered that the frequency of wildfires from 1987 to 2003 was almost four times the average of 1970 to 1986, and that the total area burned by these fires was more than six times the previous amount. Additionally, the interannual variability in wildfire frequency was strongly associated with regional spring and summer temperature (Spearman’s correlation of 0.76, P &lt; 0.001, n = 34). The average length of the wildfire season from 1987 to 2003 increased by 78 days, a 64% increase from the average between 1970 and 1986. This was due to a combination of earlier yearly ignitions and later dates of control. Finally, the average time between discovery and control for a wildfire increased from 7.5 days in the earlier period to 37.1 days in the later period [
