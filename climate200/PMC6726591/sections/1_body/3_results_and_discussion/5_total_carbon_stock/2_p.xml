<p id="p0160">The total carbon stock in the study area was 50.74 tons/ha and 37.11ton/ha for PNV and CGL, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). With regard to total carbon in PNV, relatively higher carbon amount was observed in all the six carbon pools compared to the value found in all carbon pools of the CGL. This is attributed to the presence of higher species richness, diversity, density, DBH, litter and herb biomass compared to the CGL, which makes the PNV higher in total carbon stock. Significant differences between the exclosure and adjacent grazing land in woody species richness, diversity and evenness was reported (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wolde et al., 2018</xref>), which has been contributed for higher total carbon stock in PNV compared to the adjacent CGL.
