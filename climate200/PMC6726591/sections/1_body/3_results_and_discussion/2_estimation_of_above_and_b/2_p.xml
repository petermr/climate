<p id="p0140">The above ground carbon stock of protected natural vegetation (PNV) was ranged between 11.59 and 42. 22 ton/ha with the mean value of 21.05 ton/ha whereas, the adjacent communal grazing land (CGL) ranged between 7.16 and 32.04 ton/ha with the mean value of 15.31 ton/ha (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The above ground carbon stock was higher in the PNV compared to the CGL. The algometric estimation of below ground carbon stock, with 0.5 times that of the above ground carbon, sill indicated higher in PNV compared to CGL (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The potential drivers like over grazing and human interference for firewood collection, tree/shrub cutting for fencing and construction, and charcoal making could be attributed to lower the carbon stocks in communal grazing land. Free grazing in the communal grazing land aggravated soil and vegetation degradation, which in turn negatively affected vegetation restoration and accumulation of aboveground biomass (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wolde et al., 2018</xref>) where the carbon stock is calculated. In addition, the management practices, basal area, species richness, the number of individuals per ha, species diversity and species composition were the probable reason for the differences in the AGC and BGC among the two-land use systems. For instance, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Raju (2012)</xref> reported that, basal area is an important parameter, which determines the carbon content by the species. The more basal area and diameter indicated the more biomass (
