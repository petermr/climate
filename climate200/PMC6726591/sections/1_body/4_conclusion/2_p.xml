<p id="p0175">The mean carbon stock in all carbon pools of the PNV was found greater than that of the CGL. The carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
 <sub>2</sub>e), which indicates the carbon dioxide emitted or sequestered in the PNV was 186.22ton/ha where as the carbon sequestration of the CGL was 136.19 tons/ha CO
 <sub>2</sub>e. The management influence like area exclusion, which has been practiced in PNV was contributed to increased species richness, diversity, density, litter and herb biomass, and soil organic carbon compared to the CGL, which makes PNV higher in total carbon stock. Because, the carbon losses from the different land use types are associated with loss of vegetation cover and soil erosion (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wolde et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that establishment of exclosures, with least interference of human and livestock, on degraded lands could support the restoration of degraded native vegetation and soil properties, which consequently enhance the carbon sequestration potential of the ecosystem as well as support the ongoing climate change mitigation strategy in the country in general and Northern Ethiopia, Tigray Region, in particular. Therefore, opportunities for improved grazing land management as well as increasing carbon sequestration should be developed and enhanced in degraded land condition, which will also have significant contribution to the household economy by providing opportunities to diversify livelihood. Finally, we recommended, the need for further studies on temporal and spatial vegetation biomass and carbon stocks should be thoroughly investigated to capture the whole dynamics of the grazing land ecosystems under various regimes of grazing exclusions.
