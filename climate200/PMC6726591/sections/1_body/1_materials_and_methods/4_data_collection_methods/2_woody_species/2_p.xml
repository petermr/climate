<p id="p0035">The data collection on woody vegetation, herbs, grasses, litter, and soil samples were carried out between September and December 2017. Trees measuring ≥2.5 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH), approximately 1.30 cm above the ground, and shrub diameter at stump height (DST), about 30 cm from the ground, were measured from each quadrat of the corresponding size. In case, if the stem of a tree was branched at breast height or below, the diameter of separate branches were measured to consider as individual tree similarly, applied to multi-stemmed shrubs (

A calibrated bamboo stick having 5m height graduated with 10 cm markings was used for measuring the height of longer tree species whereas a Sunto clinometer was used for trees greater than 5 m in height. The biomass and carbon stock of dominant trees and shrubs were estimated using allometric equations developed for tree and shrub species (
