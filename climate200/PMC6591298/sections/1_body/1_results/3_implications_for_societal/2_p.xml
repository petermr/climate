<p id="Par19">Although the aggregate population distributions of impact exposures vary only slightly across socioeconomic scenarios, they vary markedly when populations are stratified by income level (as defined by the World Bank, see Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), which we take as an indicator of the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances. The exposure of populations in countries at different average per-capita income levels varies widely across the SSPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5;</xref> Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). By 2050, all countries exceed the World Bank’s low-income threshold; in the high economic growth SSP1 and SSP5 scenarios, almost all of the world’s population lives in countries with per-capita GDP above its upper middle- or high-income thresholds. Regions with a preponderance of lower middle-income countries face significant adaptation challenges under SSP2 (Asia), SSP3 (Asia, South America, Africa, and Middle East), and SSP4 (Asia, Africa, and Middle East). In the Middle East and Africa, 147–446 million inhabitants of nations facing high-adaptation challenges experience increases in the total final energy use of 25–50%, and 117–341 million experience increases of &gt;50% under SSP2, 3, or 4. In Asia, the corresponding figures are smaller: 7–67 million and 38–66 million, respectively (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Moderate warming under RCP 4.5 scales down the overall distribution of people exposed to increased energy demand.
