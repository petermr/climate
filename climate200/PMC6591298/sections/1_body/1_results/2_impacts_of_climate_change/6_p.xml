<p id="Par17">ESMs agree that large areas of the world are likely to experience final energy demand increases of up to 10% by 2050 under RCP 8.5 and SSP5 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). While increases of &gt;50% are confined to the tropics and the southern parts of the United States, there is substantial agreement that Southern Europe and China experience increases of &gt;25%. There is consensus among ESMs that the total final energy use declines in Northern Europe, Russia, western Canada, and the United States, broad agreement on reductions of up to 10% in Northern Russia, the United Kingdom, and Patagonia, and no agreement that the total energy demand will decline by more than 25% in any part of the world. The differences in these spatial patterns among the SSP scenarios are minor.
