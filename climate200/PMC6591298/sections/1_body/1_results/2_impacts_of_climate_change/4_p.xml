<p id="Par15">Changes in energy demand due to warmer temperatures shift the baseline exposure patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, brown lines). The total demand rises with increased frequency of hot days (with the largest effects arising for 15–70 additional days) and falls with reduced frequency of cold days (with the largest effects arising for declines of fewer than 10 cold days). The net impact is amplification of global energy demand by an amount that is an order of magnitude smaller than the socioeconomically driven increases in energy demand (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), at the median of our ESM ensemble, adding 37% (20%) or 90–131 (48–67) EJ/yr by 2050 under RCP 8.5 (RCP 4.5). Across 21 ESM and 5 SSP realizations, net effects are uniformly positive but differ widely in magnitude, with a global interquartile range of 25–58% (11–27%) under RCP 8.5 (RCP 4.5).
