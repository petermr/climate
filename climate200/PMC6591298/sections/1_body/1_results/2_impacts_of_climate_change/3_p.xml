<p id="Par14">Over the period 2010–2050, the largest increases in baseline final energy demand occur in heavily populated tropical and mid-latitude areas exposed up to 75 (50) additional hot days and up to 40 (30) fewer cold days under vigorous (moderate) warming (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). This expansion is the largest for areas experiencing small changes in hot or cold days (&lt;10), reflecting the fact that at mid-century, most grid cells experience only modest changes in temperature, especially under the moderate RCP 4.5 scenario. The SSP-specific multi-ESM means (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d, g, h</xref>) suggest that socioeconomic forces shift this pattern monotonically, with the largest (smallest) absolute quantity of energy demand exposed under the rapid economic growth (population growth) SSP5 (SSP3) scenario. Patterns of exposure vary markedly among climate model realizations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b, e, f</xref>).
