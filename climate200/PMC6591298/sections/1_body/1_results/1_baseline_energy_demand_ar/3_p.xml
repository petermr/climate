<p id="Par11">Current global energy demand is concentrated in the high per-capita income, high-population density areas of temperate regions, especially Western Europe, United States, Japan, and China. Baseline final energy demand grows by a factor of 1.4–2.7 for industrialized regions, with more rapid growth in China (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Conversely, the tropics are home to developing economies that are poorer and consume far less energy, but whose population, income, and energy demand all increase significantly under the SSP scenarios. Energy demand in tropical developing regions grows by a factor of 2–4. Globally, 2050 baseline energy demand is two to three times larger than today (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), or an increase from 137 EJ of climate-exposed final energy use in 2010 to 234–388 EJ by mid-century (see Supplementary Table
