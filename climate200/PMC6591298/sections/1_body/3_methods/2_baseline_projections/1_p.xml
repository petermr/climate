 <italic>x</italic> sector consumption growth factors that were used to scale each sector’s per-capita energy demand from its 2010 level. The resulting country-wide average values of per-capita demand for the three energy carriers by four sectors were then combined with gridded maps of future population under the SSPs to yield projected levels of energy demand across the globe on a 0.25° grid. Due to the lack of information for spatial distribution of energy demands, the energy demand in each grid cell is simply the national average energy demand per capita multiplied by the population in the grid cell.
