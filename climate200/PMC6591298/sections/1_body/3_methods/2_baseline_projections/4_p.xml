<p id="Par39">Because the SSP quantifications of the IAMs are only publicly available for aggregated sectors and regions, we merged our residential and commercial sectors into a single-building sector. Also, there is no SSP information available on the agriculture sector, so we could not make that comparison. For some sector 
 <italic>x</italic> energy carrier combinations, we could not estimate statistically significant elasticities, and therefore our method does not project any change from today’s level, with future projections of GDP per capita (for instance, for petroleum products in the industry and building sectors). For the largest (and for the fastest-growing) energy carrier 
 <italic>x</italic> sector combinations, such as electricity in buildings and industry, our baseline demand projections are in line with IAM projections. For some others, such as natural gas in buildings, our method assumes a tighter relation between energy demand and GDP per capita compared with IAMs. For this comparison, it is also important to note that there are some definitional differences for the base year between the IAMs and our data, as can be seen in Supplementary Fig.
