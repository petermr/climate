<p id="Par42">Aggregating the results across energy carriers and sectors yields 21 ESM realizations of future change in total final energy demand for each of two RCP scenarios and five SSP scenarios. The SSP scenarios were developed as discrete storylines with no information as to their relative likelihood of occurrence; accordingly, we treat energy demand under each SSP, as well as its potential to generate a high or low trajectory of radiative forcing, separately. Within each scenario combination, we treat each ESM’s gridded realization of temperature as an independent draw from an unknown conditional probability distribution. The realizations of 2050–2010 changes in temperature exposure, and concomitant effects on energy demand, generated by our ESM ensemble can be weighted in any number of ways

 </sup>. The simplicity and transparency of the independence assumption make it a useful jumping-off point for characterizing the risk of climate-change impacts.
