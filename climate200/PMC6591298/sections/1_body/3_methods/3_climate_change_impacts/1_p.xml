<p id="Par40">The last methodological step is calculating the effects of mid-century climate change relative to the baseline. Our main data source is the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP)
 <sup>

 </sup> scenarios simulated by 21 Earth System models participating in the global Climate Model Intercomparison Project round 5 (CMIP5)

 </sup>. The NASA-NEX-GDDP are both bias correction as well as spatial downscaling of the CMIP5 data to a consistent spatial grid. The bias correction is based on a statistical approach that compares spatially explicit GCM output for a historical period to actual historic data to compute an offset to shift the local GCM results. The spatial downscaling is a combination of linear interpolation, with preservation of the spatial details of the observational data. A detailed description of the NEX-GDDP data set can be found in ref.
