<p id="Par29">Future climate change is likely to affect energy use in the transport sector as well, but as suggested in DCSW, the underlying drivers remain opaque. On the one hand, people occupying vehicles modify cooling and heating while driving to maintain thermal comfort. On the other hand, when faced with extreme cold or hot weather conditions, they might simply make different mobility choices (e.g., drive more, or do not drive at all). Weather traditionally does not enter the model of the demand for transportation, and temperature-related energy use is marginal for transportation purposes. Since our projection methodology cannot discern the fraction of energy that is sensitive to variations in weather, we focus on the final sectors where temperature more directly affects the climate-sensitive energy use. The dynamics of the transport sector are more complex and sub-sector-specific (e.g., fright transport would have different dynamics compared with personal mobility choices. In the residential sector demand for mobility, services would also interact with leisure-labor choices), calling for dedicated studies first identifying the underlying mechanisms at play, and subsequently evaluating them empirically.</p>
