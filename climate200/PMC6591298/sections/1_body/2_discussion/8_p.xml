 </sup>, our explicit consideration of uncertainty yields important insights, especially for policy makers. Although the lower tail of the RCP8.5 distribution of shocks to the global total final energy demand overlaps the upper tail of the RCP4.5 distribution (cf Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests confirm that the two densities differ. As early as mid-century, there can be benefits to mitigating climate change (
 <italic>t</italic> tests indicate a statistically significant 14–20% difference in the means of the distributions), but the associated costs depend critically on the uncertain greenhouse gas intensity of electricity generation that satisfies the anticipated large increases in future demand. Such increased electricity consumption does not translate one-to-one in carbon emissions, as, depending on the merit order, higher or lower carbon-intense electricity production technologies might be dominant. Similarly, adapting to an uncertain climate poses a monumental challenge to energy supply and infrastructure development planning: for RCP 8.5 (RCP 4.5), worst-case amplification among the CMIP5 ESMs of the 2010–2050 change in ex-ante total final energy demand is 150% (41%) globally, and across regions, 265% (68%), concentrated in Asia, generally in line with the recent IEA cooling demand outlook

 </sup>. Such uncertainties, stemming from the ensemble of ESMs, dwarf the uncertainties in percentage and absolute impacts due to differences in sectoral composition of countries’ energy systems under the various SSPs (Fig.
