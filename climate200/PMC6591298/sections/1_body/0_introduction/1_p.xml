Population expansion, economic growth, shifts in the sectoral composition of economies, behavior of individuals and organizations, and the pace of technological development are multiple sources of uncertainty that will interact to determine future demand of different energy sources across regions

 </sup>. Layered on top of this are the additional uncertainties in the timing and intensity of future temperature changes—both at the global level, driven by trajectories of global greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing, and at finer geographic scales, determined by the effects on future regional climates.
