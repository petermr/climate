 </sup>. Top–down models do not articulate end-use services, but rely on aggregate national statistics and macroeconomic drivers. When extending the time horizon to the long term, bottom-up models also face the issue of technological and behavioral uncertainty, often being addressed through stylized assumptions or reduced-form relationships between the parameter of interest and income

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>

A top–down method makes it possible to develop ex ante climate-induced potential impacts prior to any direct or indirect adjustment induced by market interactions between future technological or behavioral changes with energy supplies and the rest of the economy through price changes
