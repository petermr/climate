 <caption> The total energy demand exposed to changes in cold and hot days. The upper half displays the results for RCP 8.5, the bottom half for RCP 4.5. In the detailed panels ( a, b, e, f) the blue lines depict present-day energy demand, and the red lines depict SSP5 baseline energy demand for 2050; brown lines indicate energy use under SSP5 after impacts of climate change (mean and all 21 individual ESMs) exposed to changes in hot and cold days. Aggregate panels ( c, d, g, h) show the multi-ESM mean for all five SSPs. Impacts from climate change are only shown for changes in hot ( b, d, f, h) or cold ( a, c, e, g) days; combined impacts are shown in Supplementary Fig.Â  7 </caption>
