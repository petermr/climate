 <caption> Agreement across ESMs on changes in final energy demand. Maps depict the number of climate models that agree on decreases and increases in total energy demand across sectors and energy carriers by more than 0% ( a, b), 10% ( c, d), 25% ( e, f), or 50% ( g, h) by 2050 under RCP 8.5 and SSP5, as a result of temperature projections and changes in both hot and cold days (see Supplementary Fig.Â  9 for RCP 4.5 results) </caption>
