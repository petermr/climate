 <caption>
  <p>Exposure of people with different adaptation challenges to changes in energy demand. Cumulative distribution of the number of people exposed to percentage change in climate-related final energy demand by country GDP per capita. Panels represent global results (
   <bold>a</bold>) and three major developing world regions: Asia (
   <bold>b</bold>), South America (
   <bold>c</bold>), and Middle East and Africa (
   <bold>d</bold>). Lines indicate the multi-model mean and all individual 21 CMIP5 models by 2050 under RCP 8.5. Present-day World Bank definitions for GDP per capita were used to classify countries in income categories, which we used as a proxy for adaptation challenges (GDP per capita &lt;6000 USD/yr for high-adaptation challenge, 6000–15,000 USD/yr for moderate-adaptation challenge, and &gt;15,000 USD/yr for low-adaptation challenge, see Supplementary Note 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for detailed discussion). Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> presents a version of this figure for RCP 4.5 and Supplementary Figs 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1,</xref>
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> present the results by sector and fuel
