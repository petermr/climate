 <caption>
  <p>Frequency distribution of surface temperature across the six timestamps on 22 June 2017 shown in 
   <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Surface temperature distribution range from 22°C to 41°C (from left to right at each panel). Panels describe variations in the peaks and shape at each timestamp. The patterns of surface temperature distribution can be quantify through thermal roughness (RqT), where the higher RqT means higher distribution of temperatures across the site.
