  <p>A typical TPC for intertidal organisms. TPC is divided into different performance categories to identify the levels of thermal stress. This TPC has its sub-optimal range from 0°C to 21.2°C; optimal range is from 21.2°C to 30.1°C with optimal temperature (T
   <sub>opt</sub>) at 28°C; sub-lethal range from 30.1°C to 35°C and finally high lethal temperature is &gt;35°C.
