 <caption> Surface temperature distribution on 22 June 2017 at 16:00 EDT. This figure compares the total area (greyscale) during low tide to micro-refugia area shown in black (in this scenario, micro-refugia are defined as sites where surface temperature &lt; 28°C). This figure shows how spatial models can reveal the scarcity of micro-refugia at the rocky shores during a heat event. </caption>
