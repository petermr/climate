<p>Spatially explicit body temperature and physiological performance modelling can further be used to quantify areas of micro-refugia (
 <xref rid="ref119" ref-type="bibr">Monaco 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015
 </xref>) by applying a series of threshold temperatures. For example, using a definition of ‘refugia’ as any temperature under 28°C, the area calculated from the Fort Beach site at 16:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) (20:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)) is 255 m
 <sup>2</sup>, less than 7% of the total aerially exposed site area (3931 m
 <sup>2</sup>;

Simulations of relative performance provide the opportunity for an even more in-depth examination of the ecological consequences of temperature variability, by identifying areas of lethal, sub-optimal temperature, optimal temperature, sub-lethal temperature and lethal temperature (
