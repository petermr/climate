<p>Notably, it is the temperature of an organism’s body that ultimately drives physiological responses and not the temperature of its surrounding environment per se. 
 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Kearney (2006</xref>) defines this as the ‘niche’ temperature, as differentiated from aspects of the ‘environment’ such as local air temperature. This distinction is not trivial, as the body temperature of ectothermic plants and animals can be very different from local air temperature, especially when exposed to direct sunlight (

 </xref>) and are affected by the characteristics of the organism such as colour, shape, mass and material properties (
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Helmuth, 2002</xref>). For organisms with large areas of their body adhered to the substratum (limpets, barnacles, some snails and small mussels) body temperature usually closely tracks the temperature of the rock surface (
