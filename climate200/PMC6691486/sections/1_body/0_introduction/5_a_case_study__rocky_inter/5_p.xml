Here we present an integrative framework that utilizes DEMs and heat budget models to quantify microhabitat temperatures (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), using a ~ 50 m × 100 m intertidal site on the Northeast coast of the US (Fort Beach in Marblehead, MA; 42.508° N, 70.843° W; 
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) as a case study. Using this approach we characterize the full suite of microenvironments at this rocky intertidal site as a function of structural complexity and discuss how this approach can be used to explore the role of microclimate in driving patterns of behaviour, physiological performance and mortality. This framework includes (i) capturing fine-scale topographic data using drone photography to produce 3D models and DEMs, (ii) transforming large-scale weather data to account for surface orientation to solar radiation, (iii) identifying microhabitat temperatures using a heat budget model and (iv) comparing predictions of body temperature against thermal performance models to make spatially and temporally explicit predictions of relative physiological performance.
