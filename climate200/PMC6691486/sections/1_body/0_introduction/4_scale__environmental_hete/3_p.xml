<p>An increasing number of physiological studies are similarly beginning to consider the scales over which physiological responses can vary in time and space (

 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Dong 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017
 </xref>), for example, measured cardiac function in three species of intertidal snails and showed that intraspecific variation (physiological polymorphism) in flat-line temperatures exceeded interspecific differences. They also showed that, congruently, differences in habitat temperatures within sites far exceeded differences among sites along a 12° gradient in latitude on the coast of China. 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Denny 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2011
 </xref>) reported differences in within-site microhabitat temperatures that exceeded those reported over 14° of latitude on the west coast of North America, and 
 <xref rid="ref145" ref-type="bibr">Seabra 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2011
 </xref>) found similar differences on the Iberian coast. These combinations of heterogeneity in environmental conditions (microclimates) with inter-individual variability in physiological sensitivity have significant implications for how we envision selective regimes (

 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Diamond 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012
 </xref>) or when an environmental parameter such as temperature is measured in one specific location and then used to represent an entire site (e.g.
