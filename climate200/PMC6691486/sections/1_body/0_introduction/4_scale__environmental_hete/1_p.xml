<p>Questions about scale and especially about the importance of environmental heterogeneity (EH) have a rich history in ecology spanning many decades (
 <xref rid="ref143" ref-type="bibr">Schneider, 2001</xref>). Relationships between EH in space and time and biological parameters such as distribution, abundance, biomass, biodiversity and resilience in the face of perturbations have been explored in habitats as diverse as coral reefs (

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Boyd 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016
 </xref>), terrestrial forests (

 <xref rid="ref120" ref-type="bibr">Morelli

 </xref>), deserts (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013
 </xref>), deep sea benthos (
 <xref rid="ref174" ref-type="bibr">Williams

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Clark

 </xref>) and rocky reefs (
 <xref rid="ref108" ref-type="bibr">Matias 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Understanding the role of EH in these processes has taken on new significance in this era of ongoing rapid environmental change (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">Kelly, 2019</xref>), and a number of studies have begun to explore the role that microclimates may play in mediating larger-scale climatic drivers (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Maclean 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015
 </xref>). For example, sites with high levels of EH (and thus presumably species richness) may represent priority areas for conservation or similarly serve as ‘rescue sites’ following extreme events (

 <xref rid="ref135" ref-type="bibr">Roberts 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017
 </xref>). EH driven by structuring species such as bivalves and macroalgae has been shown to override large-scale geographic trends in environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">Jurgens and Gaylord, 2017</xref>), with implications for predictions of range shifts and resilience to climate change. Increasing surface complexity has also been explored as a mechanism to increase biodiversity on seawalls (
