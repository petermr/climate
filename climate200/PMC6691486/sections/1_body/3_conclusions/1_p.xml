<p>The development of fine-scale, spatially explicit models of physical structure, temperature and ultimately physiological performance can provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change and the potential role of small-scale refugia in driving much larger-scale, geographic patterns. Specifically, the modelling framework we present shows why the relationships between these different data layers can be highly non-linear and therefore urges extreme caution when extrapolating from structural complexity (EH) and microclimate diversity. While the case study shown here has direct relevance to rocky intertidal systems, it also has applicability to other ecosystems, especially those where temperature is largely driven by patterns of solar radiation (
