<p>In the past, fine-scale topographic data have been difficult and expensive to obtain, and DEMs were produced using methods such as real-time kinetic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping (

 </xref>). In this framework, fine-scale topographic data are mapped using an sUAS flown at low elevations (e.g. 5 m) above ground level, in a grid format and from various directions, to capture numerous high-resolution images from a camera angle of 45°. We used this approach to capture a total of 528 photos at Fort Beach. This high number of images is needed to capture all the topographic characteristics and to allow photogrammetric methods to estimate aspects, slopes and height of these topographies at a resolution of 2 × 2 cm. Agisoft Photoscan Pro photogrammetry software was used to convert footage from the sUAS to 3D virtual models, which were exported as DEMs (
