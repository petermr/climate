 <p>The topography of an organismâ€™s microhabitat can strongly influence the environmental conditions that it experiences. We present a model that allows mapping of thermal microclimates in rocky intertidal systems, facilitating exploration of the role that these environments may play in driving physiological and ecological responses to climate change.</p>
