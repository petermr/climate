This result may be explained by the fact that conventional flood adaptation through structural mitigation is preferable as it provides tangible or quantifiable outcomes which can be easily measured (e.g., river dredging, dyke construction, coastal protection). A key informant also mentioned that flood mitigation financing schemes always need verifiable indicators to measure the effectiveness of the program. Adopting a physical infrastructure approach is a popular option for flood risk reduction projects.
