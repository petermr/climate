<p>Finally, the limitations of our study must be acknowledged. The sample size for the quantitative survey data analysis was less than the goal identified through sample size calculations. Due to this, the authors could not conduct a statistical comparative analysis of perspectives exhibited by different groups (DRR, CCA, and developmental groups). However, these limitations should not have significantly impacted the quality or outcomes of this study, as the authors were confident in the high-quality data from all key stakeholders involved in the process of DRR and CCA policy development in Jakarta. Another limitation to note is that this research did not elaborate the utilities of collaborative governance concepts, so further work should be undertaken to investigate the opportunities and challenges of collaborative governance regimes in integrating DRR, CCA, and Development groups.</p>
