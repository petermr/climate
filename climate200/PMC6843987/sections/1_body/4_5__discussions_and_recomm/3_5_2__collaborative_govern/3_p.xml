System context, which in this regard is community resilience building, is defined as the surrounding environments that will affect and be affected by the collaborative governance regime. For this reason, community resilience building must be seen from a holistic perspective and failure to do so will lead to disconnected policies and disharmony between different institutions. As this paper brings to light the perspective of each group regarding features and barriers to a flood-resilient community, it is expected that the existence of a DRR–CCA convergence framework could be more meaningful and useful to establish the three fundamental dimensions (as listed previously) for collaborative governance to implement a community resilience program in Jakarta Province.
