<p id="Par4">There is growing recognition that the use of locally available resources such as orphan crops can contribute to adapting to climate variability and change (Bvenura and Afolayan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>; Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2002a</xref>) while supporting sustainable diets and food systems. Orphan crops may offer ‘new’ opportunities in the advent of climate change as they are uniquely suited to local harsh environments, provide nutritional diversity, and enhance agro-biodiversity within farmer fields and home gardens (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), create niche markets in local economies, and serve to simultaneously harness and protect local knowledge (Massawe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>). Furthermore, they are a mainstay of rural food systems. However, these reported benefits are largely anecdotal with limited empirical evidence. When compared to major crops, research has also shown that most orphan crops are low yielding and have limited benchmarking resulting in low adoption in mainstream farming systems (Chivenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Mabhaudhi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2009</xref>; Mayes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>). Despite the inherent low-yield potential exhibited by orphan crops, the fact that they have persevered with a little formal support suggests they may be resilient and possess certain desirable traits within communities who utilise them which may be useful for climate-change adaptation. In this regard, orphan crops may contribute to building resilience of the communities over the long-term.
