<p id="Par3">Orphan crops are defined as crops that have either originated in a geographic location or those that have become ‘indigenized’ over many years (&gt; 10 decades) of cultivation as well as natural and farmer selection (Dawson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>). The term ‘orphan’ has often been used to refer to crops that may have originated elsewhere, but have undergone extensive domestication locally, thus giving rise to local variations, i.e., ‘naturalized/indigenized crops’ (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017a</xref>). Indigenized crops are sometimes referred to as orphan crops (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017a</xref>). Underutilised indigenous and traditional crops are often characterized by the limited development relative to their potential. Consequently, they have poorly developed and understood value chains and these vary across geographic and socio-economic settings. Several research findings have advocated for their use as a part of sustainable agriculture techniques that speak to adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable intensification of production systems (Branca et al.
