<p id="Par7">There is sufficient evidence that shows that climate change will affect crop yields and quality (Shindell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>). A change in the observed climate will affect the growth of crops through multiple mechanisms, including changing phenology, heat stress, water stress, waterlogging, and increases or reductions in pests and diseases (Venkateswarlu and Shanker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2009</xref>). Based on general circulation models, the forecasted yield changes in 2050 are estimated to be between − 27 and + 9% across all the developing countries for the three key staple crops [maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.), rice (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), and wheat (
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.)], assuming a carbon fertilization effect (Nelson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>; Zargar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2017</xref>). According to Scheelbeek et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2018</xref>), the impacts of environmental changes on nutritional quality remain unclear for vegetable/legume and fruit crops due to scanty quantitative reports. On the other hand, there are overwhelming data that show clear impacts in cereal crops (Beleggia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2018</xref>; Chaturvedi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>; Giri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>; Manderscheid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1995</xref>; Scheelbeek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2018</xref>; Smith and Myers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2018</xref>). Higher carbon dioxide concentration, for example, is shown to lower concentrations of zinc, iron, and protein and raise starch and sugar content in crop plants that use three-carbon fixation pathway such as wheat, rice, and soybeans (
 <italic>Glycine max</italic>) (Vermeulen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2012</xref>). However, to our knowledge, there are no published reports that show the impact of climate change on nutritional quality in orphan crops. Anecdotal reports often suggest that, due to the generations of farmer and natural selection, nutritional quality of orphan crops may be resilient to climate shocks. However, similar to the other anecdotal reports of orphan crops’ potential, this requires empirical evidence to be confirmed.
