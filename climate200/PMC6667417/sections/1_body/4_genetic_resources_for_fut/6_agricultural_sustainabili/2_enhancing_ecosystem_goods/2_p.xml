<p id="Par24">The cultivation of orphan crops suited for local environments could provide nutritional diversity for communities, and an option for crop rotation for farmers, creates niche markets in local economies, and harnesses and protects local knowledge (Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2013</xref>) and agro-biodiversity (Gaisberger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Orphan crops provide opportunities for farmers to disrupt pest and disease cycles, replenish nutrients through improved contributions and support of nutrient cycling, and increase the presence of pollinators (Chapin III et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>). Orphan crops can, therefore, be considered as protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>). Thus, harnessing local knowledge and the use of orphan crop species has enormous potential to improve food security in the developing countries under climate change (Vorster 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2007</xref>). With the risk of a shrinking food basket under climate change, mainstreaming orphan crops into local food systems will mitigate malnutrition, which is predicted to also increase under climate change. However, despite this reported potential, orphan crops still face significant obstacles with regards to being mainstreamed into the dominant agricultural landscapes and food systems.
