<p id="Par22">Crop suitability mapping is an assessment of land performance when it is used to produce specific crops (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>). Adaptation of crop growth to the capabilities and constraints of local agro-ecological conditions is a key principle of sustainable land management (Bharucha and Pretty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Pretty and Bharucha 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2014</xref>) and for climate-change adaptation. Identifying optimum land for cultivation of orphan crops is necessary for the conservation of environmental resources and, at the same time, achieving optimum yields (Eastman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1999</xref>). In addition, identifying optimum land suitable for cultivating orphan crops is essential for producing more with fewer resources for sustainability. Thus, cropland suitability mapping provides information for growing potential crops and deriving maximum economic benefits with lower production costs (Kihoro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2013</xref>). Crop suitability mapping will facilitate a better utilisation of marginal land and water resources, providing opportunities to produce orphan crops in areas that are projected to become unsuitable for the production of major crops. This is consistent with transformational adaptation which has also been defined as fitting to or fitting with the socio-ecological landscapes, depending on how it is conceptualized.
