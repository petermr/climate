<p id="Par17">Until recently, we knew little about the breeding systems and pollination mechanisms in many crops (and particularly for tree species) or the genetic relatedness of accessions within a species. The development of Next-Generation Sequencing (Goodwin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>) and particularly generic genotyping approaches such as Genotyping-by-Sequencing (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.diversityarrays.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.diversityarrays.com/</ext-link> for one approach) have permitted a step change in our ability to interrogate these systems. The only prerequisite for genetic analysis by GBS is the ability to extract DNA which can be reliably cut by bacterial endonucleases (Goodwin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>). By collecting trees or crop plants within a population and multiple seed from individuals, we can begin to get a clearer idea of the breeding systems and the factors (insect, distance, prevailing wind, etc.) involved in pollination.
