<p id="Par25">Millions of people in the global South rely on orphan crops as primary food sources. Numerous studies have shown that these crops are highly nutritious, containing several micro- and macro-nutrients that are essential for health, more so than common major crops (Kour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>; Magbagbeola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2010</xref>; Nyadanu and Lowor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2015</xref>; Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>). For example, several traditional cereals, legumes, and vegetable crop species, in particular, contain high proportions of vitamins, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, and zinc, and some orphan fruits and vegetables contain more vitamin C and pro-vitamin A than major crop species and their staple counterparts such as maize (Kour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>; Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>) (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Certain orphan crops also have been reported to have certain health protection and medicinal properties, and can have protective effects against the major chronic diseases. For example, finger millet has a low glycemic index and can be digested slowly, making it popular among diabetic patients (Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>). Finger and pearl millets have anticancer properties and might have potential to contribute to the prevention of cancer initiation due to the phenolic extracts which they contain (Tadele 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>). Depending on species, the inclusion of orphan crops into low-income household diets can improve the availability of some essential nutrients, especially essential amino acids, fibre, proteins, and promote dietary diversity. This makes them an important component for nutritious diets (Nyadanu and Lowor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2015</xref>) and should be part of a basket that still includes major staple crops with high nutritional value.
