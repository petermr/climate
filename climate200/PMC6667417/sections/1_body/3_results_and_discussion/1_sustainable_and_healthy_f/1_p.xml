<p id="Par11">A sustainable food system delivers food and nutrition security for all in a way that is economically, socially, and environmentally sound so as not to compromise food security and nutrition for future generations (Van Esterik 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2005</xref>). Sustainable food systems also allow for sustainable diets which have been defined as diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for the present and future generations (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>). Malnutrition results from deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micronutrients (Ravi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2010</xref>), and it includes both under- and over-nutrition (Faber et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). To date, 821 million people, mostly in South Asia and Africa, are estimated to be undernourished and lack enough food and, another 2 billion people are overweight (FAO et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>). Furthermore, 151 million children under the age of 5 suffer from some form of malnutrition (under- or over-nutrition), which accounts to 45% of deaths in children in the same age group (Baldermann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Black et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). There is need to invest in nutrition-sensitive agricultural strategies that provide sustainable diets and can continuously contribute to addressing malnutrition challenges under changing climate.
