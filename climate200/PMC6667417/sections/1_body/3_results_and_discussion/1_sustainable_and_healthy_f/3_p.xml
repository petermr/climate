<p id="Par13">Several orphan crops are nutrient dense and their ability to adapt to harsh conditions suggests that they can be deployed as part of efforts to champion climate-change adaptation, agriculture, and economic advancement for smallholder farmers residing in low-production environments (Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2011</xref>). Orphan crops already form part of local food systems, suggesting that they are socially acceptable (Rojas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2009</xref>). Seeds of orphan crops are often locally sourced, and their production systems do not require large amounts of fertiliser and other agrochemicals making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option for resource poor communities (Dawson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>). In addition, their vast genetic pool presents an important sub-set of agro-biodiversity; therefore, they strengthen and enhance farm-level resilience to perturbations (Padulosi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2011</xref>). There are also strong linkages between high agro-biodiversity and the ability of food systems to deliver adequate quantities of healthy and nutritionally balanced food (Gillespie and van den Bold 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>; Rosin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2011</xref>). In this regard, orphan crops could support and strengthen the existing food systems to deliver sustainable diets as they are economically, socially, and environmentally sound, and offer cross-cutting solutions (Mabhaudhi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017b</xref>). Incidentally, the continued existence of orphan crops within marginalised farming systems shows that they are adaptable to changing climates making them front runners for transformative adaptation.
