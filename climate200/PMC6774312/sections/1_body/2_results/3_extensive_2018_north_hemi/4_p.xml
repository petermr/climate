<p>For the high‐emissions scenario (RCP8.5, section 
 <xref rid="eft2570-sec-0005" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>), the average concurrent hot day area during May and July is projected to cover more than 70% (multimodel median) of the NH AgPop area every day at the end of the 21st century (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). The average concurrent hot day area scales approximately linearly with global mean temperature increases between +1 and +4 °C, with an increase of about 16% of the NH AgPop area per degree Celsius warming (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). The warming in 2018 in the CMIP5 models since 1870–1900 is about +1.2 °C, which is slightly larger than current estimates based on observations (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] , 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and is related to data coverage, the choice of reference period, and interannual variability (see section 
 <xref rid="eft2570-sec-0015" ref-type="sec">4</xref>).
