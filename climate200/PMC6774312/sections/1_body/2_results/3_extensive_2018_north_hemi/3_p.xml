<p>Between May and July 2018, a daily average of about 22% of the NH AgPop area experienced a heat wave (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). This extreme spatial extent of the GCWH18 event is unprecedented in the observational record when considering heat wave between May and July and nearly 8% larger then the second largest event of this kind in 2012. Computing the concurrent hot day area between May and August, 2010 and 2018 have a similar extent (23% and 22%; Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>a) and also for May to September (both 21%; Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>b).
