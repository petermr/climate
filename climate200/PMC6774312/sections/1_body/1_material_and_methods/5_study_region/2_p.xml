<p>We focus on latitudes north of 30° of the “human‐affected and human‐affecting” regions that either have a high population density (above 30 km
 <sup>−2</sup>) or are important agricultural areas as defined in Seneviratne et al. (
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) with a total area of 23.7×10
 <sup>6</sup> km
 <sup>2</sup>. This study region is referred to as NH AgPop area hereafter (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
