<p>The daily concurrent hot day area fraction over the target region is illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. For the base period from 1958 to 1988 the daily area fraction that is concurrently affected by extreme warm or hot conditions covers on average 10% of the focus region (since we define hot day based on 90th percentile exceedances; see section 
 <xref rid="eft2570-sec-0007" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>). The 2018 area fraction exceeds the 1958 to 1988 areas by around a factor of 2 on average every day between May and July. The daily 2018 area peaks in the end of July reaching a maximum of 37.5% (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2570-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Hereafter, we focus on the temporal average between May and July 2018 as considered Global Concurrent Warm and Hot 2018 event, in short, GCWH18 extreme event.
