<p>As an observational data basis, we use daily temperature from ERA‐40 (40‐year European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis; Uppala et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) for the period 1958–1999 and ERA‐Interim (European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis; Dee et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2570-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) data for the period 1979–2018. We merged the ERA‐40 and ERA‐Interim data to cover a period from January 1958 to December 2018, with ERA‐Interim starting in January 1979. We tested the consistency between ERA‐40 and ERA‐Interim by computing the root‐mean‐square error and mean bias between both data sets for the overlapping period (1979–1999). Both metrics show rather small difference between the data sets, in particular in the study region (see section
