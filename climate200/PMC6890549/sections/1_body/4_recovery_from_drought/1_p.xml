<p>Are households able to return to their previous state of development after the drought has passed? The answer to this question is provided by Moser (1998) in his resilience and sensitivity approach. Moser (1998) believes that the nature of assets and risk management strategies are critical if one needs to understand how individuals or poor households recover from disaster. Here ‘asset’ refers to sources of income, such as employment and social capital, which include the social networks, skills and institutions responsible for disaster management. Moser (1998) reaffirms that the level of vulnerability to disaster, and the ability to recover from it, is determined by the quality and quantity of assets owned by an individual or a household.</p>
