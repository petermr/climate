<p>Chambers (1983), using a case study in India, showed that, following the drought years, a decline in assets led to a circle of poverty, or what he calls ‘asset depletion-replenishment cycles’ where it is believed that those best able to replenish are those least depleted. This argument demonstrates how the lack of buffers to resist shocks can lead to other ‘ratchet’ effects that could result in a household becoming permanently vulnerable to poverty.
