<p>The finding from interviews revealed that communities in the study area have traditional knowledge to predict, prevent, mitigate and cope with drought, such as cultivation of drought-resistant crops, seasonal migration and diversification of the market. However, this knowledge presents many weakness and limitations. One is that since the level of poverty is high, communities do not have assets to convert into other consumable assets. The communityâ€™s traditional knowledge is dying out, which is vaguely understood by all members of the community. Communities have no means to diversify their income when drought is severe. Combining all these factors, there is a reason to believe that they are vulnerable and unable to resist the drought effects.</p>
