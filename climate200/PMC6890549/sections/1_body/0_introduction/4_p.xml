<p>Several global imperatives, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development programme (UNDP), also underpin the need for renewed attention to the communitiesâ€™ knowledge of managing drought effectively (Hoppers

For instance, the Luo community in Kenya had a large number of climate monitoring indicators that enabled them to tell when it was the right time to start planting in anticipation of the rains or to preserve and store food in anticipation of a dry season. These indicators include observation of the behaviour of animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, vegetation and trees, winds, temperatures and celestial bodies (Mwaura
