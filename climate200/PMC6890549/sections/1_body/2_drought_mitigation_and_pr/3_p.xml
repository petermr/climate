<p>The mixing of crops has also been a strategy to prevent and reduce shocks from drought. In Tanzania and Kenya, mixing maize and cassava on the same plot can assist in surviving drought, as cassava is more resistant to dry conditions than maize (Mwaura

Building granaries and storing food in times of abundance, to be used in times of scarcity, and building wells and dams have been effective in preventing and minimising the shocks. For instance, in Tanzania, the main vegetable for storage is the cowpea. When drought is predicted, the cowpea is cooked, dried in the sun and then stored. Other food stuffs ‘dried and stored included blood, meat and fish’ (Mwaura

In normal years, households build up stocks that they can draw on during dry seasons. In Kenya, because of the unpredictable nature of drought, pastoralists embark on strategies to take advantage of the good years. Primarily, they often stock more productive females in their herds to ensure the cultivation of livestock, when the climatic conditions improve and grass and water become abundant, and thereby replace the animals lost to drought (Makali et al.
