<p>Studies demonstrate that most households attempt to integrate flexibility into their basic livelihood systems in order to minimise external shocks (Chen 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Mwaura 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Flexibility is most often directed at production systems, such as diversification of crops and livestock, in the use of different resources, deployment or recruitment of labour and in the mix of different occupations and activities, such as seeking employment (Chen 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>:110). Cultivators mix crops and animal husbandry to varying degrees, mix and rotate crops with varying maturity and yields, mix family and hired labour in different ratios and combine cultivation with other activities as needed to weather the effect of shocks (Chen 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>:111). Learning from India, Chen (

 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>:111). In India, when drought is predicted, shepherd households engage in agriculture. Other households engage in wage labour in order to accumulate resources which could help minimise the shocks (Chen
