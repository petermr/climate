<p>In Kenya, pastoralists were successfully able to cope with droughts. One method adopted was to maintain exchange relations with neighbouring agricultural counterparts with whom they exchange livestock and animal products for grains to supplement their diets when the production of milk went down. The Maasai, for example, traded with neighbouring agricultural groups, such as the Kikuyu from Central Kenya, where they obtained cereals in exchange for their livestock products, such as milk, hides and skins (Orindi, Nyong &amp; Herrero 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Under extreme cases, the Maasai have adopted non-pastoral activities like charcoal-burning or engage in various forms of employment for income. In some cases, raiding of neighbouring communities was also carried out for restocking (Orindi, Nyong &amp; Herrero 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In addition, many households or families keep animals with relatives and friends elsewhere to guard against losses during drought. Animals kept elsewhere are always brought after the disaster, as pastoral families are able to restock quickly (Makali et al. 2009).
