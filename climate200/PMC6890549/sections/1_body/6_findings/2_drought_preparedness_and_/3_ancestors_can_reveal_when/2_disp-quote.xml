 <p>Ancestors will always tell when anything bad is about to happen. They care for us. Sometimes they tell people what needs to be done in order to avoid such things from happening. If people do respect and honor what ancestors tell them to do, then nothing will happen, and if it happens, it cannot be very serious as it should.
