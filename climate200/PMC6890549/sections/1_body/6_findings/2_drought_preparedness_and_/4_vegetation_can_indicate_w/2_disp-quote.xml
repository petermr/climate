 <p>Trees and grass, can tell you that this year, there will be rain or drought. When drought is about to happen, you will see trees, not growing any leaves, and will see that that the tree looks as dry. These trees normally bear leaves and flowers in June or July, and in August or later September, we have the rain. When this does not happen, people start getting ready for [a] dry year.
