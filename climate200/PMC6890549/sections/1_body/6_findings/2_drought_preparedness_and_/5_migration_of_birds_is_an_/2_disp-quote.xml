 <p>Usually, we know that there will be drought or rain from observing and listening to birds. Sometimes, you will see all the birds that we usually see here, are no longer in the area. You will see other birds which are not of this area. Sometimes, birds usually sing when the rain is about to come, when we observe that these birds have not sung up to August, then [we] will expect serious drought in that year.
