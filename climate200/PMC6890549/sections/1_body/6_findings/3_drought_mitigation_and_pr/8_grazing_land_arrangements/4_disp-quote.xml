 <p>Yes, people migrate with the cattle to other areas, people grow some crops, but all these contribute very little to prevent people from starving. Even those people who go somewhere else with their cattle, they do not return with all of them, some die. I know one neighbour who went [to] Nqutu, all his cows died, he only retuned with skins for drums. People these days prefer not to go, they just stay and wait.
