 <p>Drought is not like a fire, no one knows where it comes from. If it was like a fire, everyone in the village would stand and we can put the fire down. But drought is something different. Maybe, if we should have water to irrigate like what I see in Dundee where there are white men, I think, we can reduce the impact of drought. Even those white people are affected by drought, even they that have those irrigation systems, but sometimes they grow crops and vegetables while we are suffering from drought and cannot get anything to eat. Only God and our ancestors can help us bring down this disaster. (Participant 7, female, head of household, age 45)</p>
