 <p>Grazing arrangements with other clans where there is no drought, helps keep our livestock alive, but the problem is that most of us do not have cows, only goats. It is difficult to travel two days or one week with goats in search of grass, if you are there what can you eat? You need to have enough food, now where can you get food to eat alone while you leave the family without food? (Participant 5, female, head of household, age 37)</p>
 <p>We have problems going grazing in other areas. Sometimes you will find that people in the area are not happy with our presence, because they feel that we will exhaust all available grass. Sometimes this leads to conflict between those coming in the area and the owners of the land. (Participant 4, male, head of household, age 42)</p>
