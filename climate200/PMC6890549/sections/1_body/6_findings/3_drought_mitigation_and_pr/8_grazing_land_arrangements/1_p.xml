When one area is affected, people can move and graze in the area which is not affected. Grazing arrangements presented some serious challenges. These challenges range from conflicts between those in search of grazing pastures and those living in the area. Another challenge is the distance that needs to be travelled and duration of stay whilst grazing. It was indicated by participants that those who have livestock also have other household responsibilities, and when they are absent from home, it creates more problems for the family left behind. Women asserted that when men are absent from home, it is difficult for women to negotiate loans and deal with other household problems.
