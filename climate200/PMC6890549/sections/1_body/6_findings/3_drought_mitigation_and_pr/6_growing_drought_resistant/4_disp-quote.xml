 <p>Yes, we grow sweet potatoes, sorghum, but the problem is that, people cannot live on eating sweet potatoes for two or three months or even five months till the rain comes or not. If we have sweet potatoes, will it be possible to eat only potatoes without anything else? Sometimes you canâ€™t even get these potatoes. (Participant 9, female, head of the household, age 41)</p>
