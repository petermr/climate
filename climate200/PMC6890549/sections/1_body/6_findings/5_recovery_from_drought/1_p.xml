<p>Having looked at coping strategies during and after the drought, it is evident that household systems are not stable but change over time as they respond to a particular crisis and are therefore not equally vulnerable to the same risk (Davies 1996; De Satge et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Oelofse &amp; Dodson 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). A greater percentage of participants lack the capacity to withstand shocks. They are unable to recover from drought given their income levels, and the lack of social and external support. They could thus be regarded as a ‘low resilient household’ since they have been unable to resist the effects of the disaster. These low resilient households are faced with the after-effects of drought that restrain them from recovery. In Davies’ (1996) words, ‘their capacity to recover has been eroded’, and they cannot even meet their basic needs. Their main concern is survival, and they will therefore make every effort to earn a living rather than being too worried about the future. In this study, very few participants displayed a capacity to recover or gave an indication that they will recover in the future. For example, one man indicated that it has taken him more than 10 years to buy a cow, thus implying that it might take him more or less the same number of years to recover.
