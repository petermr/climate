 <p>We choose some old women to go pray to God and ask for rain. When we come closer to the mountain, there is one tree from which we take some of leaves and wrap them on our hips and neck, then we go up to pray to God. Then God will tell us to go down to the river, and wash ourselves. When we arrive there, just after washing, the rain starts with us. Ah … ah … But these days people are not interested in these things, but sometimes we do, but not much as used to be … in that time. (Participant 10, female, head of household, age 43)</p>
