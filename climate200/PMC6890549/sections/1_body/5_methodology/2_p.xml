<p>For the purposes of this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted amongst 16 heads of household who were recruited from various areas of the Msinga villages, and participants in the study were over 19 years of age. The sample was heterogeneous as it was composed of both men and women. The objective of using male and female heads of household in the interview was to cross-check the information and see variations in view of both genders. Here, a household is understood as a unit, composed of the members of a family who live together under the same roof, whilst the head of a household is understood as a person in charge of all managerial activities and responsible for household needs.</p>
