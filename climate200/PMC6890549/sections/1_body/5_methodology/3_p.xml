<p>In the semi-structured interview, questions are normally specified, but the interviewer was free to probe beyond the answers to seek clarification and elaboration. The selection of heads of households was justified by the fact that the researcher assumed that heads of a household would be better equipped to respond to the questions presented by the interviewer as they deal with all the households’ managerial decisions and the allocation of food during periods of drought. It was therefore expected that they would be informed about drought in the area. Sixteen respondents were chosen as they are placed in key positions that allowed them to interpret community vulnerability to drought and who understood how drought is managed. Busha and Harter (

In this study, the researcher was aware that the target population could only speak

 <italic>isiZulu</italic> and vice versa to record the responses and make use of recorders to capture what might have been omitted whilst translating. Before the interview process, the research assistants underwent a three-hour briefing session on how to conduct interviews and provide instant translations.
