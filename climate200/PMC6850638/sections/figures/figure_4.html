 <caption> Changes in projected SST (top) and Chl‐a (bottom) from 2001 to 2100 from the coupled global climate–NPZD model. SST and Chl‐a change relative to starting value in 2001 is shown by the colour scale in each map, black circumpolar bands identify the four latitude bands used in the model (40–50°S, 50–60°S, 60–70°S and 70–80°S), thick black lines at 60°W and 130°E identify breaks between the two oceanic regions modelled. Change over time ( x axis, years between 2001 and 2100) in SST and Chl‐a shown for each latitude band for Atlantic/Indian area (left graphs) and Pacific area (right graphs). Note the vertical axes have different scales [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com] </caption>
