  <p>Historical whale harvests shown by (a) heat map, where black circumpolar bands identify the four latitude bands used in the model, and thick black lines at 60°W and 130°E identify breaks between the two oceanic regions modelled, and (b) stacked column graph of total harvest over time between 1890 and 2015; (c) schematic of direct interactions between physical climate drivers (bottom from left—changes in sea ice, chlorophyll, sea‐surface temperature) and biological features of models (phytoplankton, copepods, krill and whales) detailing the relationships between the primary model that included environmental forcing from temperature and phytoplankton (Model 1) and alternative scenarios that added links between changing sea ice and future whale distribution (Model 2) and where all climate drivers were excluded (Model 3). Arrows identify the direction of the driver and/or interaction; whales depicted from left to right are southern right, humpback, fin, minke and blue [Colour figure can be viewed at
