<p>The primary climate model (Model 1) estimated less than 3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25,081, males and females) of the total preharvesting numbers of blue, fin, southern right and humpback whales remained across the Southern Hemisphere by the early 1970s, due to unsustainable catches of these species totalling over 1.3 million whales between 1890 and 2012 (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,b). We exclude here minke whales, which were harvested only in relatively low numbers towards the end of the 20th century, and note southern right whales were already depleted by the end of the 19th century, with catches of this species in the 20th century almost exclusively taken by illegal Soviet whaling operations (Ivashchenko &amp; Clapham, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), although small numbers of catches also occurred in the coastal waters of different countries. Estimates for the total abundance of these four species indicate that they are currently at 12% of their preharvesting levels, and numbers of all species are currently increasing. Although Model 1, which estimated 12 parameters for each whale species and included environmental forcing from temperature and phytoplankton production, but no sea‐ice effect, was the most parsimonious model based on the AIC (AIC = 47.9, Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), differences between model fits were not significant and historical model trajectories showed similar trends. This was expected given the small trend in temperature in the Southern Oceans during the historical period (Figure
