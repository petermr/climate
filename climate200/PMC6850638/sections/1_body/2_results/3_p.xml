<p>Predictions from Model 1 show warming in the Southern Ocean under RCP8.5 will differentially affect southern baleen whale species, leading to population crashes of some populations and slowing the recovery of others by the end of this century (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Despite continued predicted recovery of all species from depletion during the early 21st century, results demonstrate substantial reductions in total numbers of fin, blue and southern right whales by the end of this century. Vulnerable species such as fin whales that were depleted by &gt;70% by historical harvesting are predicted to only be 5% of precommercial whaling numbers by 2100 across the Southern Hemisphere given projected changes in temperature, chlorophyll and primary productivity. Biggest declines are predicted in the Pacific, with populations of fin and southern right whales potentially becoming locally extinct by 2100, while blue whale numbers are predicted to be at &lt;1% of precommercial whaling levels (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Population declines were not as extreme in the Atlantic/Indian region, although model predictions show halted recovery for fin and southern right whales by the late 21st century. Although humpback whales were predicted to make a full recovery by 2050, numbers of these whales in the Pacific are predicted to halve by 2100. Minke whale numbers have increased rapidly during the last century, but growth is predicted to slow in the Atlantic/Indian region or even reverse in the Pacific over the next 100Â years.
