<p>We also tested the sensitivity of whale projections to the distribution of whale feeding patterns and the availability of their krill food source. First, we projected whale abundance when the proportional distribution of mid‐latitude krill‐feeding whales (humpback, fin and southern right) was shifted 5° south to where krill density is currently greater, and we assumed some prey switching occurred by halving the proportion of krill consumed by whales in latitudes 50–60°S and increasing the corresponding proportion of alternative prey sources consumed (our copepod group in the model). Few major changes were observed in recovery trajectories for Pacific populations, but faster recovery for fin and blue whales was predicted in the Atlantic/Indian region, although this tapered off for fins by the end of the 21st century (Figure

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), given variability in current circumpolar estimates, with the upper threshold of biomass estimates (&gt;500 million tonnes (Atkinson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>, Siegel, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>)) slowing the reduction in mid‐latitude krill biomass and slightly improving outcomes for whales in the Pacific. The sensitivity of the model to different forms of the functional relationship between predators and prey was examined by modifying the interaction parameter, but there was little change in future trajectory trends of each whale species. Our climate‐forced model projections demonstrate that the direct and indirect effects of changing environmental factors are much more influential in driving changes in krill and whale numbers than the specifics of the two‐way predation interaction between whales and krill alone.
