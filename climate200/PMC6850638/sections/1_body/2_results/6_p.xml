<p>We ran alternative models with no climate forcing to test the sensitivity of whale population dynamics to intraspecific competition and changing prey availability, and of krill dynamics to predation versus changing environmental conditions. Although model fits to historical data were similar to the climate‐forced model (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) implying that most historical changes reflect harvesting and whale recovery, predicted trajectories under more extreme environmental conditions diverged (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). Recovery was predicted to continue for all whale populations throughout the 21st century when climate links were removed from the model. Importantly, the full recovery predicted for humpback whales by 2050 is strongly reversed in the climate‐forced model after 2050, particularly in the Atlantic/Indian region. Dramatic differences in predicted trajectories between models were observed for Pacific whale populations, which were predicted to make near complete recoveries when there was no climate forcing.
