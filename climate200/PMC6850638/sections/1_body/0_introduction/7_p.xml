<p>Here, we assess impacts of two anthropogenic pressures on baleen whales—historical whaling and future climate change—across the Southern Hemisphere, using a multispecies Model of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) (Plagányi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). We build on an earlier MICE of whale recovery that included primary productivity (phytoplankton), krill, copepods (the most abundant small zooplankton) and five baleen whale predators: the southern right whale

MICE are well suited for developing predictions of large‐scale system dynamics requiring an understanding of interactions between species and processes because these models restrict focus to the key ecosystem components required to answer the question and can account for key uncertainties through parameter estimation based on fitting to data and sensitivity analyses.
