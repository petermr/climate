<p>The climate at some polar regions is changing faster than any other region in the world (Meredith &amp; King, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Changes in the Southern polar region are not uniform, varying regionally and temporally (Massom &amp; Stammerjohn, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Matear, O'Kane, Risbey, &amp; Chamberlain, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), with increases in Antarctic sea‐ice extent and cooling in regions such as the Ross Sea (Turner, Hosking, Bracegirdle, Marshall, &amp; Phillips, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0110" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), compared to significant sea‐ice losses due to warming in the west Antarctic Peninsula (Stammerjohn, Martinson, Smith, &amp; Yuan, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Stammerjohn, Massom, Rind, &amp; Martinson, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Warming has already impacted low trophic forage species such as krill (Atkinson, Siegel, Pakhomov, &amp; Rothery, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Kawaguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), which has undergone a 30% decline in density in some areas such as the Scotia Sea since the 1980s (Atkinson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), and future warming and changes in primary productivity are expected to accelerate. Changes in polar species phenology, survival and southward range shifts driven by warming oceans are predicted (Clarke et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). Shifts in food webs from the base to top predators in the West Antarctic Peninsula have already been observed (Ducklow et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Schofield et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
