<p>There is a paucity of examples of ecosystem models linking marine environmental change and associated changes in primary productivity to krill and their predators in the Southern Hemisphere (Klein, Hill, Hinke, Phillips, &amp; Watters, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Earlier models have investigated the recovery of baleen whales from harvesting (Mori &amp; Butterworth, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and explored the role trends in krill populations may have in predator recovery (Klein et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Plag√°nyi &amp; Butterworth, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Watters, Hill, Hinke, Matthews, &amp; Reid, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). An integrated assessment of whale recovery under climate change is missing that links future recovery of individual whale species to multiple climate drivers and changing food availability (krill and copepods) across the Southern Hemisphere.
