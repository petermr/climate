<p>This study fills an important knowledge gap concerning how baleen whales might respond to a changing climate, including examining how phenotypic plasticity may improve recovery for certain species. We highlight potential benefits for some whale populations, particularly those ice‐associated species distributed across high latitudes such as blue and minke whales, if they have the capacity to adapt and change their feeding patterns given changing sea ice in the Antarctic and a shifting prey base. This is because of projected increases in productivity and low trophic prey biomass around Antarctica, compared to large declines in their primary krill prey around the Antarctic circumpolar current further north. Such phenotypic plasticity has already been observed in the Northern Hemisphere, with changes in phenology in response to ocean warming demonstrated by fin and baleen whales in the Gulf of St Lawrence Canada (Ramp, Delarue, Palsbøll, Sears, &amp; Hammond, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), and northward shifts in distribution of blue and fin whales around Iceland as a response to changes in the marine environment (Víkingsson et al.,
