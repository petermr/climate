<p>The recovery of baleen whales in the past few decades following the cessation of &gt;200 years of intense whaling in the Southern Ocean exemplifies the benefits of modern conservation protection measures, such as the restrictions on commercial whaling implemented by the IWC, to reduce human pressures on species of conservation concern. Earlier research predicted that baleen whale populations previously depleted by historical whaling would continue to recover (Mori &amp; Butterworth,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), but these studies did not consider the impact of anthropogenic climate change on food availability in the Southern Ocean. We found the long‐term and potentially irreversible changes to physical processes and the marine environment that are expected with future climate change threaten the recovery of these whale species. Our coupled climate–biological models predicted future negative impacts of climate change for krill and all whale species, although the magnitude of future climate change impacts on whales differs among populations. Despite demonstrated recovery of whales throughout the late 20th century after depletion from historical whaling, we show strongly negative future trajectories for Pacific populations of blue, fin and southern right whales, with potential for extinction. There were also large declines in fin and humpback whales in the Atlantic/Indian oceans. These trajectories highlight conservation concerns for local populations of fin and blue whales, with both species currently listed on the IUCN Red List as endangered (Reilly, Bannister, &amp; Best, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">2008a</xref>). Our findings suggest that whales feeding in mid‐latitude areas may be more heavily impacted by climate‐driven changes in prey availability than those that are distributed further south. Although the impact of climate change on ecological processes is difficult to quantify, we used the latest information about climate impacts on lower trophic levels (see Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>) to parameterize our models in the Southern Ocean and validate key links between climate change drivers and low trophic krill prey (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Our models substantially extend previous research (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) by including both two‐way predator–prey interactions and also linking multiple climate drivers (i.e. SST, chlorophyll and sea ice) to whales and their krill and copepod prey. As such, they provide the first holistic predictions of the combined effects of multiple future climate stressors on interacting krill and whale species throughout the Southern Hemisphere.
