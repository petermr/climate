<p>Third, given the complexities of modelling whale consumption over a large geographic area and based on limited information, we used the intermediate complexity approach to represent the overall net outcome of the predatorâ€“prey interactions. For simplicity we assumed predation by other species on krill remained constant, but these species may exert a strong influence on prey biomass in Southern Ocean ecosystems. The abundance of species such as seals that prey on krill has been posited to have increased in the wake of whale depletion during the mid 20th century (Mori &amp; Butterworth, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). We did not include other krill predators (e.g. seabirds, seals, penguins, fish, jellyfish and squid) due to the lack of information on their abundance. However, competition from seals is likely to make krill declines worse, therefore our results for whales that feed in the same region as seals may overestimate their capacity to recover from historic declines (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). This work provides the basis for extending the model from focusing on krill, copepods and whales to other important members of the ecosystem to explore further future competition scenarios. Last, commercial catches of krill were not included in the model because current catches are low in proportion to the overall estimated biomass of krill across the Southern Ocean (Nicol, Foster, &amp; Kawaguchi, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, krill catches are expected to increase in the future (Nicol et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), and could further hamper recovery of whales. Exploring how krill fisheries impact whale recovery is a priority for further research (e.g. Klein et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
