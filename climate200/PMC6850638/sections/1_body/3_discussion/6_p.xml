<p>Model trajectories show substantially slower rates of increase in whale populations over the next 50 years, in some cases reduced by one third to those of the climate‐decoupled trajectories (Model 3), leading in some cases to population crashes not observed in models that ignore multiple climate impacts (e.g. Mori &amp; Butterworth,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) highlight the importance of some key processes that will determine future whale population trends. Projections from the Scotia Sea were more optimistic than the trends projected here, which covered the entire Southern Ocean, suggesting that some subpopulations may benefit from climate change, but overall there will be declines in whale abundance. The difference between projections for whale population trends that aggregate baleen whales into a single functional group (Klein et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) versus modelling whale species as potential competitors for krill (this study) highlights the importance of interspecific differences in how whale species respond to environmental conditions, and competitive interactions among whale species in determining future recovery trajectories.
