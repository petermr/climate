<p>Finally, we used deterministic model projections and a range of sensitivity tests to provide a first approximation of the likely impact of climate on future population trends. We acknowledge that natural variability is important too in these systems, and that stochastic simulations would enable a more in‐depth analysis of extinction risk. However, considering the already large uncertainty associated with predicting the influence of climate change on whale dynamics we focused on a first‐order approximation. This is also because there is additional spatial variability in krill population dynamics that operates at a finer scale than the broad scale we used in our model. Furthermore, given the different historical recovery rates shown by subpopulations of some species such as southern right and humpback whales (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), heterogeneous future recovery and responses to environmental drivers and changes in prey at the subpopulation level is likely, and this could be tested in future work using a finer spatial resolution.
