<p>The climate predictions used in this study are broadly consistent with other climate models and observations. The greatest future warming by the end of the 21st century was predicted in the Atlantic/Indian region, supporting recent findings of rapid climate change and sea‐ice melt already observed in the West Antarctic Peninsula (Mulvaney et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Similarly, model predictions of sea‐ice melt are consistent with previous Antarctic temperature‐index melt modelling (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and observational records of the greatest melting to date off the West Antarctic Peninsula (Meredith &amp; King, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Krill declines predicted by the model align with recent experimental and observational research showing slower krill growth and higher mortality at warmer temperatures (Kawaguchi et al.,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and are consistent with recent models that predict future declines in krill in the Scotia Sea under an RCP8.5 warming scenario (Klein et al.,
