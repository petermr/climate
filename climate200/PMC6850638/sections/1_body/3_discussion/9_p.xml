<p>Our study has several inherent assumptions and uncertainties inherent in our approach. First, the global climateâ€“NPZD model used in this study uses the highest greenhouse emission scenario (RCP8.5 (Peters et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>)) to force changes in productivity. As global emissions are currently tracking this emissions trajectory, this scenario indicates the plausible extent of impacts that could be seen on whales and krill if current CO
 <sub>2</sub> emissions are not reduced (Sanford et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Our goal here was to investigate whether whale recovery might be compromised by climate change, rather than present a range of possible future scenarios given changing emissions. However, dramatic differences in our findings of continuing recovery for all whale populations throughout the 21st century when climate links were removed from the model, compared to population crashes once climate impacts were included on krill and whales, provide insight into the benefits to whale populations if global emissions were reduced. Importantly, our results provide an early warning of the plausible future population changes to be expected for whales under the current emission scenario. This evidence is important to proactively inform strategic thinking regarding future sustainable krill catch levels. Future monitoring could be used to validate or negate our predictions, although this would require ongoing surveys of whale populations that employ novel nonlethal techniques for monitoring changes in key demographic parameters such as age at first reproduction.
