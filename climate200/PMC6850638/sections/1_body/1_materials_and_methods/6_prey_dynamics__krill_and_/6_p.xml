 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We also collated distribution information from the literature for feeding areas of all whale species and prey preferences (krill vs. other prey species such as copepods, derived in Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We validated and adjusted the mean historical whale distribution per Latitude based on their upper and lower latitudinal feeding limits, and latitudinal midpoint for feeding, according to the literature (Figure
