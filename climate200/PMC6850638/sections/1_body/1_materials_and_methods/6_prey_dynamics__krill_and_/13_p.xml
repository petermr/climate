<p>The growth, abundance and spawning success of krill in Models 1 and 2 were thus influenced directly by both environmental variables (temperature, chlorophyll), whale predation, as well as the availability of prey for the krill themselves over time (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). There is no feedback into the NPZD model from krill consumption to phytoplankton biomass, but our model incorporates feedback from whale consumption into krill biomass.
