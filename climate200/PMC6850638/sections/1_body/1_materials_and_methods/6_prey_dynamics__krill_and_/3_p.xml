 <xref rid="gcb14573-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). For minke whales we calculated consumption by scaling up estimates of consumption derived for individual minke whales in the Ross Sea, Areas III and VI (Tamura &amp; Konishi,

 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). For southern right whales, some estimates of total krill consumed in the Southern Hemisphere have been derived (2,253–2,600 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>tons/year) (Perrin &amp; Wursig, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), from which we calculated approximate consumption values per area, scaled to total krill consumed by an individual whale by dividing by the proportion of Southern right whales in each area and their current population estimate.
