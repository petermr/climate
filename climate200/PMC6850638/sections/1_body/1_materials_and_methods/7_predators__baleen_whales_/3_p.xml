<p>To build upon previous research (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), we included two‐way feedbacks in the models between whales and krill using the consumption term (described above), accounting for heterogeneity in the diet of the different whale species and defined
