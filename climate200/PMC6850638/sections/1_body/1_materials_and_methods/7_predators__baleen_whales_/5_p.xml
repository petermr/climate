<p>We fitted whale trajectories to an index of abundance from available surveys for the five whale species adjusted to represent female numbers only. Parameter uncertainty was explored in a previous model version (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), with best fits used to derive final input parameters for the models in this study. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to the input interaction parameter that controls the shape of the relationship between predator breeding success and prey availability (described in Plagányi &amp; Butterworth, 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>, Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) for each whale species. We also tested the sensitivity of whale projections to the distribution of whale feeding patterns and the availability of krill food source. We shifted the gamma shape parameter for whales 5° south, and then assumed some prey switching occurred by decreasing the proportion of krill consumed and increasing the proportion of alternative prey sources consumed (our copepod group in the model), such as has been recently observed for some whales in the mid‐latitudes (Findlay et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb14573-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Although all models provide plausible outputs, we focus our results primarily on Model 1, which includes defensible links between climate change and species based on the best available science under the current emissions scenario.
