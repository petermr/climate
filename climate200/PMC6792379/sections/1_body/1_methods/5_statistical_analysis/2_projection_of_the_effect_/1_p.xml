<p>We projected excess morbidity due to temperature using the weekly temperature and morbidity time-series model by assuming the absence of adaptation and population alterations, according to previous studies (

Briefly, we determined the minimum morbidity temperature with lowest total cumulative relative risk between temperature and infectious gastroenteritis between the 1st and 99th percentile of the prefecture-specific temperature distribution. We used the minimum morbidity temperature as a reference to calculate the attributable risk by recentering the natural cubic spline. The resulting value was defined as the optimal temperature. The total attributable number of infectious gastroenteritis cases as a result of nonoptimal temperatures was calculated as the sum of contributions from all weeks in the series. The ratio of this value to the total number of infectious gastroenteritis cases was defined as the total attributable fraction. Factors contributing to the low and high temperatures were determined by combining the subsets correlating to weeks with temperatures under or over the minimum morbidity temperature. The excess morbidity for individual prefectures and combinations of GCMs and RCPs were estimated. Subsequently, attributable fractions were calculated as GCM-ensemble averages based on the decade and RCP, with the respective total number of infectious gastroenteritis cases as the denominator. Using Monte Carlo simulations, empirical confidence intervals (eCIs) and the uncertainty in the predicted association between the exposure–lag–response and climate projections among GCMs were calculated. Details of this method were described previously (
