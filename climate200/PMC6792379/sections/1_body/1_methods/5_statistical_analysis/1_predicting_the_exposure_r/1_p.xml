<p>We used two-stage time-series analysis to estimate the prefecture-specific nonlinear lag impact of temperature on infectious gastroenteritis, as described previously (

 <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Vicedo-Cabrera et al. 2019</xref>). Briefly, in the first stage, we investigated the association between temperature and infectious gastroenteritis in each prefecture through quasi-Poisson regression and distributed lags nonlinear models (DLNMs). We modeled the cross-basis function of weekly mean temperature with natural cubic spline function for the temperature dimension with three internal knots at the 10th, 75th, and 90th percentile of the prefecture-specific temperature distributions. We also included a natural cubic B-spline of time with 8 degrees of freedom per year to account for seasonal and long-term variations. Given that delayed effects of temperature on diarrhea have been known to be approximately 1 month (2 to 5 wk for food poisoning (

 <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">Naumova et al. 2007</xref>)), we examined lag periods of up to 4 wk (28 d) for temperature using a natural cubic-spline function with 3 internal knots place at equal distance in log scale (
 <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">Gasparrini et al. 2010</xref>). Weekly mean precipitation was used as the confounding factor and was modeled using a natural cubic-spline function with 3 internal knots place at equal distance in log scale. The average dispersion parameter was 11.8, suggesting overdispersion.
