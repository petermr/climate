<p>Climate change is a key threat to human health across the globe and a challenge for public health practice (

Several countries have begun evaluating vulnerabilities to climate change, establishing adaptation and mitigation methods, and distributing climate data to health services. However, the spread and degree to which these actions will shield populations from increasing health risks associated with climate change is unclear (
