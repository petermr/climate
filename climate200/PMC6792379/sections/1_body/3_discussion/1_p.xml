<p>We estimated future projections in temperature-related excess morbidity due to infectious gastroenteritis throughout Japan using five GCMs and four RCPs. Our models projected a net decrease in temperature-related excess morbidity due to infectious gastroenteritis under higher emission scenarios in Japan. Our findings suggest that climate change may decrease the incidence of infectious gastroenteritis in Japan.</p>
