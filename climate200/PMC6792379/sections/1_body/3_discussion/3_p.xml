<p>Outdoor temperature may affect the various pathogens implicated in diarrheal diseases in differing ways in different regions. Evidence in Japan indicates an association between norovirus and rotavirus infection and low temperatures in comparison with the low number of cases detected in the summer months (

 <xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a positive association between ambient temperature and the incidence of bacterial diarrhea, but not viral diarrhea (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Carlton et al. 2016</xref>). These results suggest that the majority of temperature-related diarrhea cases in Japan are attributable to viral infections during the winter season. Our findings of a net reduction in infectious gastroenteritis due to global climate change are therefore biologically and geographically plausible in Japan or other countries in which the great majority of instances of infectious gastroenteritis are of viral origin. However, we were unable to assess pathogen-specific effects in our modeling, and the associations reported in our study cannot be extrapolated directly to the countries in which bacterial infectious gastroenteritis comprises a larger fraction of cases. Given that bacterial and viral organisms may exhibit varying responses to the impact of climate change, our findings likely demonstrate the effect of the most frequent cause of viral infectious gastrointestinal disease. Moreover, our study demonstrated significant spatial heterogeneity in the temperature–morbidity relationship among prefectures, suggesting that the effect of climate change on the incidence of diarrheal diseases may differ depending on the region as a result of spatial variability in the distribution of pathogens (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">Carlton et al. 2016</xref>). However, to generalize the effect of climate change without accounting for pathogen characteristics may not be accurate, and the actual association of temperature with diarrheal pathogens may be more complex, including specific clinical features such as duration, severity, dysentery, febrile illness, and vomiting (
 <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">Platts-Mills et al. 2015</xref>). Further, the latency period of infectious gastroenteritis differs according to the pathogens, and these differences may also indicate a need for comparisons using various different distributions. Our findings should therefore be interpreted with this in mind, and additional studies are needed to determine the possible future impact of climate change on specific pathogen-mediated infectious gastroenteritis in different regions and countries.
