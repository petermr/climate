<p>We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the exposure–outcome association at daily basis, and the estimated exposure–response curves of the daily analysis were similar to the weekly one (Figures S5 and S9, respectively). We consider also a second sensitivity analysis on which the exposure–response curves were calculated using weekly data, but we calibrated the projected time series of daily mean temperature using the observed distribution of daily mean temperature, and we projected the time series of daily outcome using uniform distribution of events within a week. The estimates of attributable fractions for the period 2010–2019 obtained using the main and sensitivity analyses are reported in Tables S6-S8. The results of the sensitivity analysis are consistent with the main analysis and confirm the highest impact of cold with respect to heat. The excess morbidity calculated under the two sensitivity analyses are reported in Tables S9 and S10 and showed a similar pattern of the estimates using weekly counts data (
