<p>In summary, our study projected a net reduction in temperature-related excess morbidity due to infectious gastroenteritis in Japan under higher-emission climate-change scenarios. Insufficient knowledge about climate effects on different types of diseases and areas is available, and further studies on longer-term projections of specific pathogen-induced infectious gastroenteritis due to climate change by adjusting for future demographic changes and adaptation are warranted.</p>
