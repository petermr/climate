<p>Both plastic and evolutionary processes can result in temporal variation in thermal limits and are often difficult to distinguish experimentally [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, thermal sensitivity based on phenotypic plasticity or adaptation may manifest differently depending on the duration of the warming event or trend being examined [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180550C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. For example, populations living under different climatic regimes may have different upper thermal limits at any point in time as a result of reversible acclimation. If exposed to an extreme short-term anomaly such as a marine heatwave, these differences could have important implications for the sensitivity of the different populations to disturbance, such as greater mortality of individuals in the cool-acclimated population, yet no observable impact on the warm-acclimated population. By contrast, under a more gradual, long-term warming trend, the cool-acclimated individuals may have time to adjust toward the optimal species-specific limit and therefore the same two populations may display a more similar upper thermal limit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180550F3">figure 3</xref>). Trans-generational acclimation or evolutionary adaptation may result in a slower rate of homogenization of thermal limits between populations. Therefore, population-level differences in thermal limits may also be relevant to sensitivity over longer periods of time, including decadal warming trends, typically associated with climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180550F3">figure 3</xref>). Three factors that can influence the rate of homogenization of thermal limits between populations are (1) acclimation time, (2) environmental warming rate and (3) the generation time of the organism.

   <p>(1) The temperature and time that an organism spends acclimating can have a strong bearing on its critical and lethal thermal limits [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Organisms have a maximum acclimation capacity representing the maximum amount of plastic physiological adjustment they can make (i.e. the species-limit for sub-optimal populations). Acclimation at warmer, subcritical temperatures can enable populations to increase their critical or lethal limits toward the species-limit [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, the duration of time needed by organisms to fully acclimate can differ greatly between taxonomic groups and climatic regions. For example, some tropical and temperate fishes can fully acclimate to elevated temperatures within 2–5 days [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. By contrast, some Antarctic fish species require up to 20 days to fully acclimate to warmer conditions [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], while some Antarctic invertebrates can require between two and five months [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Such taxonomic and regional differences could have an important influence on whether sub-optimal populations can adjust their thermal limits to short-term thermal anomalies or not.

   <p>(2) Environmental warming rates can also have a strong bearing on the upper thermal limits of locally acclimated organisms [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In thermal tolerance experiments of Antarctic ectotherms, Peck 
    <italic>et al</italic>. [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] observed a negative relationship between the upper thermal limits of marine invertebrates and the rate of increase in temperature. Species exposed to a 1°C day
    <sup>−1</sup> increase in temperature displayed a median thermal limit of 12°C, compared with a 7.5°C limit at a warming rate of 1°C week
    <sup>−1</sup> and a 3.1°C upper thermal limit at a warming rate of 1°C month
    <sup>−1</sup>. Thus, the rate of onset and duration of warming events such as marine heatwaves are likely to have an important bearing on the upper thermal limits of organisms and their sensitivity to warming [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Moreover, these results suggest that high tolerance limits of local populations in response to short-term extreme warming events may not necessarily be indicative of the upper thermal limits that can be expected in response to decadal warming trends, as long-term limits may indeed be lower than expected.

   <p>(3) Species’ generation times and life-history traits can also have an important influence on sensitivity and the agility of populations to respond to warming. Sub-optimal populations of species with short generation times will have a greater capacity to undergo both plastic and genetic adjustments in their thermal niche in response to climate warming. Indeed, while genetic change to population thermal limits requires multiple generations (e.g. for thermally tolerant genotypes to be selected for within the available gene pool), species with generation times of days to weeks [
    <xref rid="RSTB20180550C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] may have the capacity to adapt more quickly than species with generation times of multiple decades, and undergo ‘more rapid’ developmental or trans-generational acclimation.
