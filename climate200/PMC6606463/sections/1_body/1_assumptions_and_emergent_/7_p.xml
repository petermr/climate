<p>Upper TSMs along the bottom 5th percentile of the wedge displayed no significant relationship with range position (

 <italic>c</italic>). Twenty-three and 14% of total observations of brown and red seaweeds, respectively, were found along the high sensitivity axis, compared with 4 and 2% along the low sensitivity axis. By contrast, invertebrates (Arthropoda and Mollusca) accounted for 51% of observations in the upper 90th percentile of the distribution, while green seaweed (Chlorophyta) and vertebrates (Chordata) accounted for 18 and 14%, respectively. Forty-two per cent of total observations of Arthropoda were found along the low sensitivity axis of the wedge. All phyla displayed a broad vertical spread of TSMs consistent with the idea that marine organisms exhibit differing degrees of adaptive capacity, rather than a binary risk (
