<p>When dealing with climate change, one area that remains contested is how it is now addressed as one of the common disasters under disaster risk reduction at the national level in South Africa. This orientation further speaks to other institutions that deal with disasters at the national, provincial and local government levels. 
 <italic>The South African Disaster Management Act of 2002</italic> (as amended in 2015) enshrines climate change as one of the disasters to be addressed. Among some of the institutions outlined in the 
 <italic>Amended Act</italic> are disaster management centres, National Disaster Management Advisory Forum, South African National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, South African National Defence Force (SANDF), South African Police Service and any other organs of state that may assist the disaster management structures (Republic of South Africa 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The act also provides for the concurrence on the declarations of disasters and expenditure on response and recovery. Reference is made to the 
 <italic>Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act of 2005</italic> and the need to strengthen the representation of traditional leaders in municipal disaster management advisory forums. Of critical interest to this work is the clear reference of the 
 <italic>Amended Act</italic> ‘to provide measures to reduce the risk of disaster through adaptation to climate change and developing of early warning mechanisms’ (Republic of South Africa 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>:1).
