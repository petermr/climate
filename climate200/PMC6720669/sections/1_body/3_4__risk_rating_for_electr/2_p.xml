<p>There are fewer electrical fires in Seoul and Busan despite huge populations. In particular, there are lots of fires in Gangwon (Chuncheon city) relative to population size, which might be affected by the lack of disaster prevention infrastructure such as firefighting facilities. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, there are four cities (Incheon, Daejeon, Chuncheon, and Jeju) with at least two ratings higher than ‘high’, and five cities (Daejeon, Gwangju, Cheongju, Chuncheon, and Jeju) with at least one ‘very high’ rating. Busan is the only city with no ‘high’ or ‘very high’ rating. While Daegu has the lowest average risk rating, Chuncheon has the highest average risk rating.
