<p>So far, we have analyzed the annual electrical fires in each region and correlated them with monthly climate change variables. In addition, annual fires by cause in each region are analyzed. By integrating electric fires by region into the monthly climate variables, accumulated for 10 years (from 2006 to 2015) of statistics, the average number of electrical fires in each region in each month can be represented. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02984-f017">Figure 17</xref> shows the monthly electrical fires by region in the form of matrix diagram [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-02984" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that indicates the correlation between the climate variables and the electrical fires. This diagram shows the risk level of electrical fires in any month of the year in each region. The redder the color in the matrix, the higher the risk is. On the other hand, the more yellow the color is, the lower the risk is.
