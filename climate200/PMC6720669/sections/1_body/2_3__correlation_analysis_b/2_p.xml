<p>Overall, fires occurred most frequently in July and August when temperature and humidity were highest, and in December and January when temperature and humidity were lowest. This is attributed to the fact that the use of cooling and heating systems and electric heaters is concentrated during this period. Most causes of fires are concentrated in summer and winter but the number of fires caused by short circuit/ground fault is conspicuously high only in summer (July). Lightning strikes occur primarily in summer and are considered to cause a ground fault or line-to-line short circuits by destroying the insulation of the transmission lines. For partial disconnection, the number of fires is more concentrated in cold winter (December to February) than in hot summer. This is attributable to the surge in demand for electric heating systems in winter. Overall, humidity also shows a similar tendency to temperature.</p>
