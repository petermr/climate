<p>The accident statistics of electrical equipment according to the monthly climate variations, the risk rating and monthly risk prediction of each equipment are proposed in this section. The risk rating for equipment accidents was specified using the number of accidents by low/high voltage electrical equipment and ignition equipment. 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the risk rating for the number of accidents by low (110~440 V) and high voltage (3.3~22.9 kV) equipment and ignition equipment. Based on this table, the accident risk rating for electrical equipment is shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref> and
