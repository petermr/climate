 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the number of electrical equipment accidents and the component ratio for total accidents caused by wind (gale, typhoon) and icy snow (heavy rain, heavy snow) from 2006 to 2015. Equipment accidents caused by natural disasters were decreasing a little bit up until 2010 but they had sharply surged since 2010. They were decreasing again until 2015 but have been increasing up until now since 2015. 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-02984-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the number of annual electrical equipment accidents caused by dust and salt damage from 2006 to 2015. Equipment accidents were decreasing gradually between 2006 and 2015 except sudden increase in 2009 and 2012. Natural disasters caused by abnormal climate have been gradually increasing or intensifying, resulting in more damage to electrical equipment in the future. Improving the robustness of individual equipment vulnerable to natural disasters is a very pressing issue.
