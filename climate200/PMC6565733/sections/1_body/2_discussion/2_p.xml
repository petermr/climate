<p id="Par17">Though developed in a Canadian Arctic context, ACCVIâ€™s approach is highly adaptable and has broad relevance across circumpolar regions and other regions globally, being limited largely by environmental and socioeconomic data availability and projections. Using a new methodological approach to model vulnerability, we project the effects of various climate change scenarios on air and marine transportation systems across the Canadian Arctic. Based on the four hazards assessed we find that system vulnerability varies widely across the region and is projected to increase for at least the next 20 to 70 years. We also outline an iterative and transferable approach to model future climate change risks and delineate adaptation needs.</p>
