<p id="Par18">Developing complex and integrated vulnerability assessments comes with challenges and limitations. The authors acknowledge that several metrics available in the literature are absent of this analysis due to data availability or an inability to incorporate data into spatial assessments of aviation and marine sectors (Supplementary Discussion). Further, it was beyond the scope of this study to project potential socioeconomic pathways or changes to physical infrastructure. These limitations are highlighted as persistent scientific gaps in linked climate change socioeconomic and environmental modeling

 </sup>. Additional work is needed to address these gaps, with potential for continued advances in the vulnerability science and adaptation planning. In this context, community scale results are to be understood as relative and reflective only of variables and systems evaluated.
