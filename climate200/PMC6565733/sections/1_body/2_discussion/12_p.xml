<p id="Par27">Additional methodological developments and the application of coupled social and biophysical vulnerability modeling is necessary to further our understanding of where, when, and how communities and populations are vulnerable to climate change, both in the Canadian Arctic and globally. Uncertainties related to the static geospatial datasets currently available (e.g., poor understanding of the distribution of ground ice and permafrost) and identifying other data (e.g., historical storm surge, flooding, erosion, permafrost, and landslide risk-classification products and/or future projections made by process-based models) would be useful for developing other vulnerability models and assessments such as this.</p>
