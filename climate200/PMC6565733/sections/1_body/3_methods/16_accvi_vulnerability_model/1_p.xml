<p id="Par63">Four vulnerability hazards (rain, snow, winter-summer temperatures, and sea level rise) included Type I model and a Multiplicative equation. The model was structured to identify existing spatial trends in vulnerability. Societal factors are emphasized over climate and physical features, and marine and airport sensitivity and adaptive capacity are calculated separately from exposure. This resulted in a quasi-weight of two-thirds weight on societal factors, while climate and physical features were allotted one-third of the weight. In this model, climate and physical features were coupled then added to airport or marine sensitivity (Fig.Â
