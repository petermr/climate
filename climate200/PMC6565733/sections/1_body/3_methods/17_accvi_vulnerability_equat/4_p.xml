<p id="Par69">Both equations designated a magnitude of increase or decrease in vulnerability depending on the RCP projection being performed. When Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="">9</xref> was applied to the method, output values scaled differently, extrapolating and inflating the indices beyond the 0–1 scale (for both baseline and future scenarios) not aligning with case study and field observations data. Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ8" ref-type="">8</xref> correctly normalized values with results ranging from 0–1. For this reason, we only discuss and present results from the multiplicative equation.
