<p id="Par60">To supplement the CWI, we used data from the 2016 Canadian census. We looked at education attainment by using percent of high school diplomas, percent of trades certificates, and percent of the community that spoke Inuktitut. In combining western markers of education attainment and one element of Inuit Traditional Knowledge (language), we hoped to better reflect the diverse types of knowledge that build resilience

 </sup>. However, we acknowledge that an individual can have high levels of Traditional Knowledge without speaking Inuktitut and someone can have lower levels of Traditional Knowledge and speak Inuktitut. We also examined the percent of the community that was new immigrants as a new immigrant population likely has fewer land skills, limited knowledge of the Arctic, and no Inuit Traditional Knowledge. The percent of the population that was younger than 14 and older than 65 was also assessed. Knowing that language is only one of the many aspects of Inuit identity and culture, we strongly agree that future work needs to develop ways of measuring indicators for Inuit Traditional Knowledge for use in developing indices like those developed here.
