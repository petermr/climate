<p id="Par46">Exposure was calculated by combining climate variables and extreme indices such as temperature or precipitation projections and physical features such as permafrost, soils, elevation, slope, wind and water distance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). A detailed example of the exposure rain model calculation where climate variables are added to physical features can be found in Supplementary Fig.
