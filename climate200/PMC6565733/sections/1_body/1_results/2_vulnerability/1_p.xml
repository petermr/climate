<p id="Par12">Vulnerability results reflect coupled exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity values (rain model example Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref> and other hazards in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The results illustrate the importance of socioeconomic and political factors in determining communities’ adaptive capacity and/or sensitivities related to climate change exposure and local physical features (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). When considering sensitivity to airport infrastructure, the Nunatsiavut region has the highest modeled values, while marine values are higher for Inuvialuit region. Disaster sensitivity was estimated to be most pronounced in Nunavut, though the region has the highest modeled adaptive capacity of Inuit Nunangat (see Supplementary Data
