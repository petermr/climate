<p id="Par11">Sea level rise models indicate that Nunatsiavut and Inuvialuit regions are especially sensitive to climate change. Under the sea level rise model across Inuit Nunangat, a higher magnitude of change is projected under the 8.5 scenario. Contrary to this trend, exposure decreases at the end of the century, notably in the Hudson Bay area and Canadian Archipelago, driven by isostatic rebound. This decrease in exposure could generate new challenges for ports, such as increased docking distance and potential local marine and coastal ecosystem changes.</p>
