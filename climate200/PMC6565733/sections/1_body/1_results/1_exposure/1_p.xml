 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), projected rain, snow, winter-summer temperature and sea level rise showed substantial increase in exposure across Inuit Nunangat through 2100. Annual mean temperature was modeled to increase between 6.4 °C (RCP4.5) and 10.6 °C (RCP8.5) on average across the region, while annual mean precipitation is projected to increase by 0.80 mm/day (RCP 4.5) and 1.43 mm/day (RCP8.5) on average by 2100
