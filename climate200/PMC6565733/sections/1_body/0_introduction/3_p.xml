<p id="Par5">It is with these challenges in mind that this study proposes a new approach to developing vulnerability indices. Uniquely, the study starts with community-based research to develop a vulnerability index that incorporates both social and biophysical data with linked RCP projections across a region that is over 2 million km
 <sup>2</sup>, and is thus rooted in the climatic and socio-economic conditions that matter to a specific context. The approach is intended to complement and build on qualitative case studies, providing regional estimates of vulnerability that are increasingly demanded by decision makers
