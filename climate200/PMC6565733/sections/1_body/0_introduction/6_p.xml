<p id="Par8">Focusing on transportation system characteristics and infrastructure in communities, this study finds the most substantial driver of present and future vulnerability varies widely between communities and regions across Inuit Nunangat. At present, the most vulnerable aviation systems are observed in Nunatsiavut and the most vulnerable marine systems are observed in Nunavut; this reflects both social and biophysical patterns across Inuit Nunangat. Furthermore, vulnerability for the entire Inuit Nunangat is projected to increase over the coming decades, increasing on average across regions by 58% for future scenarios compared to the baseline. Under the 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, mean modeled vulnerability increased 56% and 60%, respectively, compared with present vulnerability.</p>
