 <caption> Vulnerability model type I was calculated for all 50 communities for present, 2040, 2070, and 2100 timeframes under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Model was run using climate variables and extreme indices and for each sensitivity indices pairing (airport-disasters or marine-disasters). Under the Type I model, exposure projections and physical features were calculated together, then added to sensitivity (marine or airport) </caption>
