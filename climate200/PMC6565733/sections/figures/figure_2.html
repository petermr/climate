 <caption> The top map shows the Inuit Nunangat region—which includes four divisions (Inuvialuit, Nunavut, Nunavik and Nunatsiavut)—and 50 inhabited communities (black dots). Buffer areas of 100-km represent areas analyzed in each community; red airplanes are airports and yellow dots harbors. The four bottom maps illustrate climate models increase values (delta) for annual mean precipitation (mm/day) and annual mean temperature (°C) for both RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios at the end of the century (2100) </caption>
