 <caption> ( a) Temperature and ( b) DOC concentration effect on the trihalomethanes formation potential (THMFP) in laboratory experiments for water sampled from the five case study sites. Error bars indicate the standard errors (n = 20) between the measurements for waters from different sites and seasons, while stars indicate the significance of the z-test results for the observed change being different from zero (***p ≤ 0.001). </caption>
