<p id="Par27">Ammonium chloride, sodium hydroxide, sodium thiosulphate, sodium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium chloride, aluminium oxide, mono and dipotassium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, iron sulphate heptahydrate, sodium hypochlorite (12%) and manganese sulphate hydrate salts were purchased from BDH (Poole, England) with 99% purity. Sodium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, orthophosphoric acid, pentane (pesticide residue analysis grade) and 1,2-dibromopropane were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) with 99% purity. A trihalomethanes calibration mix with 2000 µg/mL for each compound in methanol was purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, USA). DOC concentrations were measured in each raw and treated water samples from each case study site in order to be able to dilute them, if necessary, to either 5 mg DOC/L (raw water only) or 1 mg DOC/L, with a salt solution that mimicked typical Scottish raw water composition (Table
