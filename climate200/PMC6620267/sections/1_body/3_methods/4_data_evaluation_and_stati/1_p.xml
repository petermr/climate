<p id="Par29">Of the 42 potable water quality parameters studied in the yearly monitoring programme, ten parameters (ammonium, colour, nitrate, nitrite, TON.ratio, TON, turbidity, iron, lead, manganese) had &gt;50% below detection limit values and were excluded from the correlation analysis. Linear correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for testing the hypothesis of no correlation against the alternative of a nonzero correlation were then calculated for the remaining parameters using Matlab R2016a ©. To make the seasonal variation of different parameters more readily comparable in a single plot, the monitoring data is displayed in figures as the monthly mean for the five case study sites divided by the mean parameter value for the entire observation period, and the uncertainty is indicated by error bars equal to plus and minus one standard error of the monthly mean divided by the mean parameter value for the entire observation period. THM formation experiments for different conditions were performed in triplicates. Mean values were then calculated for different conditions such as DOC values, temperatures, etc., from the mean value of the triplicate measurements. Experimental outcomes were reported/displayed as the mean plus minus one standard error of the mean. Two-tailed z-tests using Excel 2016 © were used to test the hypothesis of no change in THM formation against the alternative of a nonzero percent change. Two-tailed Welch tests (or unequal variances t-test) using Excel 2016 © were used to test the hypothesis of equal means for the two data sets against the alternative of a nonzero difference in the mean.</p>
