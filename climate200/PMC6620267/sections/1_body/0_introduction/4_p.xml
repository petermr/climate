<p id="Par5">Since water providers regularly adapt and optimize their treatments for economic reasons and in response to regulatory changes and technological developments, it is difficult to relate directly long-term trends in surface water composition and ambient temperature to those observed for THMs in potable water. In this study, we took a different approach by considering seasonal trends in surface water quality and potable water THMs over a calendar year for five DWTPs works, which did not undergo major treatment changes or upgrades during this observation period. It has been previously noted that strong seasonal trends in THMs, with maxima in late summer and minima in early spring, and positive correlations between ambient temperature, raw water DOC, and THMs indicate the susceptibility of drinking water quality to changes in climatic conditions
