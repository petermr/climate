 </sup> DOC concentrations in 22 UK upland waters have increased by an average of 91% over 15 years. Similar concurrent DOC increases have been recorded elsewhere in Europe and North America

 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> identified declining anthropogenic sulphur emission and deposition as the main cause. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity, which has lessened in the UK as a result of declining sulphur emission and deposition since the 1980s

 </sup>. However, rising DOC trends were also observed at sites, where non-marine sulphate changes were small, such as Loch Coire nan Arr in Northwest Scotland. Overall, Evans 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> concluded that increases in temperature are the second most relevant cause, and could account for a 10â€“20% DOC increase.
