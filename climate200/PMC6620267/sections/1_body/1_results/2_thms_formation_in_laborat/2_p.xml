<p id="Par9">From the laboratory test results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) it was evident that water temperature directly influences THMs formation, as more THMs were consistently formed for a fixed amount of DOC of the same origin, at higher water temperature. This is in line with expectations for how temperature affects the reaction kinetics leading to THM formation

 </sup>. On average, 24 ± 2% less THMs were being formed in potable water at 5 °C (a typical water temperature in the winter months in Scotland), as compared to 15 °C (a typical water temperature in the summer months in Scotland), whereas 29 ± 4% more THMs were being formed at 25 °C as compared to 15 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), all statistically significant differences (z-test versus 0% difference, two tailed, n = 20, all p &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, our previously published multi-linear regression model derived from THM measurements in 93 Scottish WTPs suggests that a 10 °C increase in water temperature from the annual average of 8.8 °C would increase annual average THM concentrations by 27%

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> in Supplementary Information). This could be because, in addition to temperature, bromide availability may also control the reaction kinetics for the formation of brominated THM compounds
