<p id="Par22">In response to the increasing THM control challenge, Scottish Water has for example over the past few years, already increased monitoring, by more regularly measuring TOC in raw water, and with the installation of online DOC sensors in water treatment works. Scottish Water has also already adapted and optimized the performance of its operations, for example with enhanced coagulation or the careful evaluation and selection of filtration membranes, and with the addition of treatment steps such as air stripping of THMs, granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration or ion exchange. Such treatment upgrades will inevitably have treatment cost implications. An US EPA report

 </sup> suggests that addition of GAC filtration increases operational water treatment costs by an average 15%, while according to the report, switching from chlorine to UV disinfection (which produces less THMs) would increase cost by about 6%.
