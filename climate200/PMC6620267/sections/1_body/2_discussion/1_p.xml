 </sup>, but our monthly monitoring programme was much more comprehensive than earlier studies and comprised 42 parameters of potable and 38 parameters of raw water quality. Nonetheless, amongst the many parameters monitored, only the monthly averages of water temperature, and various indicators of the water organic carbon content had well established statistically significant correlations with the monthly averages of total THMs (TableÂ
