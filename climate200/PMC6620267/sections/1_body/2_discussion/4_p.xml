 </sup> would inevitably result in higher surface water temperatures. Indeed, an average decadal temperature change in UK river water temperatures of 0.21 ± 0.19 °C has already been noted between 1970 and 2000 as a consequence of an average decadal air temperature change of 0.3 °C, although regional variations are very substantially

 </sup>. This surface water temperature increase would also increase water temperature at the point of disinfection, considering the strong correlation between raw and potable water temperature observed in this study. From our laboratory experiments, higher water temperature would directly promote THMs formation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In addition, an ambient temperature increase may stimulate soil microbial activity in peatland, and thereby enhance surface water DOC

 </sup>. Other factors such as water levels in peat are also relevant for the microbiological DOC generation

 </sup> attributed a DOC increase of 10–20% to a 0.66 °C temperature increase, with the main cause for the overall 91% increase being reduced sulphur deposition. Evans 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> also considered hydrological drivers, and enhanced primary productivity due to raising atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub>, but concluded that these factors could not explain such a significant DOC increase over the observation period. As their report is the most detailed analysis of various factors behind raising DOC in UK surface waters, we used their estimated warming effects in combination with ASC predictions for ambient temperatures in our climate change scenarios. However, there is still no scientific consensus on the causes of the current rise in DOC concentrations, and our results demonstrate a need to ascertain temperature effects on surface water DOC for effective climate change adaptation planning in the water sector.
