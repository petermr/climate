<p id="Par21">The uncertainty in the predicted magnitude of the mean summer temperature increase in Scotland

 </sup> is inevitably reflected in the predicted increases in THM formation, which range from 0 to 100% for the various scenarios (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The mid-range scenario of a further 39% increase in THM formation would have significant water treatment implications in the British Isles and other regions with peatland in catchments, considering that maintaining THM levels below drinking water quality standards is already a current treatment challenge

 </sup>. Since water providers need to maintain water quality standards in a changing climate, further treatment adaptations will likely become necessary to maintain regulatory compliance in the future.
