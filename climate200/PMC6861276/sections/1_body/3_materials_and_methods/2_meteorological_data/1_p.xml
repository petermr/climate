<p id="Par27">To make a comprehensive analysis of WPSH, four different meteorological data sets are used in this study: (1) The hourly surface meteorological parameters at Shanghai Baoshan Climate Observatory (including temperature, relative humidity, 10 m wind direction and wind speed) are measured and analyzed. The measurements in this site are used for the international meteorological data exchange sponsored by World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Thus these data can well depict the local meteorological characteristics in Shanghai. (2) Surface temperature at 160 Chinese monitoring sites are obtained from the National Climate Center of China. (3) The climate data of five WPSH indices (including area, intensity, ridge position, northern boundary position and western ridge point index) are obtained from the National Climate Center of China. (4) The large-scale weather conditions, such as general circulation are used the data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis data

 </sup>. The data have a horizontal resolution of 2.5° × 2.5°, including the geo-potential height, specific humidity and winds data. In addition, the solar radiation data with a horizontal resolution of 1.875° × 1.904° is also used in this article.
