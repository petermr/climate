<p id="Par9">West Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is mainly affected by large-scale circulations, previous studies
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> have shown different results of how the ongoing global warming would change the WPSH. To understand the impact of Climate Change on the WPSH and its impact on ozone pollution in Shanghai, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the long-term trend of late-summer mean WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> index from 1958 to 2017. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the index of WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> significantly increased during the recent years (1958–2017), with an increasing rate of about 5 gpm decade
 <sup>−1</sup>. For example, the WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> was about 5885 gpm in 2017 and 5855 gpm in 1958, respectively. This rapid increase suggested that the global climate change had strong impacts on the WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub>, which might have important effects on air pollutants (such O
 <sub>3</sub>) in Shanghai (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
