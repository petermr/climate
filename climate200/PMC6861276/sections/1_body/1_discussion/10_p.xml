<p id="Par15">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, in the strong case (July 2017), there was is a strong anomalous southwesterly winds in Shanghai, which was enhanced by 4–5 m·s
 <sup>−1</sup> over 925 hPa. The surface temperature was higher 3 °C than the weak case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). The relative humidity was weaker by 20% than the weak case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>), and the radiation was stronger by 20 W•m
 <sup>−2</sup> than the weak case in Shanghai (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). During the southwesterly winds condition, the upwind region is a large-scale forest. As a result, the enhanced southeasterly winds transported upwind biogenic emissions to Shanghai, causing and the increasing the ozone pollution in Shanghai

 </sup>. However, it’s essential to give some supplementary explanation that although the anomaly of specific humidity was small between the strong case and the weak case, the local solar radiation and temperature were enhanced during the strong case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c,d</xref>). As a result, the higher solar radiation and temperature reduced relative humidity (RH). Furthermore, the meteorological conditions, with high temperature, low humidity, and high solar radiation were favorable for producing high-level O
 <sub>3</sub> episodes

 </sup>. And the possible effects of relative humidity (RH) on the ozone formation can be well explained by Yu (2018), as the paper shows, more air humidity could inhibits O
 <sub>3</sub> formation by lowering air temperature and some complicated chemistry processes, like decreasing the chain length of peroxy radical chemical amplifiers (HO
 <sub>2</sub>, RO
 <sub>2</sub>, and RC(O)O
 <sub>2</sub>), and decreasing the chain length of NO
 <sub>2</sub> by enhancing particle water, and destroys the existing O
 <sub>3</sub> photo-chemically by water vapor through catalytic O
 <sub>3</sub> destruction cycle

 </sup>. As a result, during the strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case, the photochemical production of O
 <sub>3</sub> was more active than the weak case.
