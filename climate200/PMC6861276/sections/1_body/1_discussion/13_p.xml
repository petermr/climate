 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the comparisons between the model results of MOZART-4 and the observed anomalies of monthly mean O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations between Jul. 2017 and Aug. 2016. The results suggest that the observations and the simulated results present a similar in the spatial distribution. For example, there were positive O
 <sub>3</sub> anomalies in Shanghai and the northwest of Shanghai, while there were negative O
 <sub>3</sub> anomalies in the west of Shanghai. However, the magnitude anomalies were higher in the simulation than the measured results. In Shanghai, both measured and modeled O
 <sub>3</sub> showed strong positive anomalies, ranging from 20 to 60 μg·m
 <sup>−3</sup>. Because this study is focus on the O
 <sub>3</sub> anomalies in Shanghai, the model simulation provides a base for the further studies.
