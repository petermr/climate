<p id="Par16">Same characteristics are found in local weather conditions in the Baoshan station in Shanghai. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> show the local weather conditions in the city of Shanghai. The average meteorological conditions were calculated for the both strong and weak cases in the Baoshan observation station. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the relative humidity was lower in the strong case (65% compared with the 71% in the weak case). The hourly maximum temperature was higher in strong case (30 °C) than the weak case (32 °C). The measured photolysis rate of NO
 <sub>2</sub> (J[NO
 <sub>2</sub>]) was higher (1.9 × 10
 <sup>–3</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>) than the weak case (1.1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>), producing higher ozone photochemical production. Another important factor that increases the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations was due to the wind directions. In the strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case, southwest wind occurred frequently in Shanghai. In the contrast, in the weak WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case, east and southeast winds were dominated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), which transported relative clean air from ocean, resulting in lower O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in the weak case. In addition, the areas with subtropical high-pressure control (the strong WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> case) are dominated by subsidence air flow, producing weak convection and cumulus clouds. Under less cloud conditions, solar radiation is high, which may greatly enhance the photochemical reactions of O
 <sub>3</sub>.
