 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> displays the inter-annual variability of monthly mean O
 <sub>3</sub> (MAD8) in Shanghai and the corresponding WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> index from 2013 to 2017. The characteristics of the two parameters were highly correlated (except during 2015), with a correlation coefficient of 0.78 (exceeding the 99% confidence level). The high correlation between WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> index and O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations indicated that the intensity of the WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> can be used as an indictor to predict a general tendency of late-summer O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in Shanghai.
