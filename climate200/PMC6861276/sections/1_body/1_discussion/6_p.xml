 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the monthly mean O
 <sub>3</sub> (MAD1) concentrations during the strong (Jul. 2017) and the weak (Aug. 2016) WPSH_SHO
 <sub>3</sub> cases in Shanghai and its surrounding regions. The results show that there was significantly difference for the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in these 2 cases. During the weak case, the maximum O
 <sub>3</sub> concentration was located in the inland and the west of Shanghai (SH), with a highest value of &gt;180 μg m
 <sup>−3</sup>. As a result, the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in SH were low, ranging from 120–140 μg·m
 <sup>−3</sup>. In the contrast, during the strong WPSH case, the maximum O
 <sub>3</sub> concentration was higher than the weak WPSH case, and the highest O
 <sub>3</sub> located in the city of Shanghai (SH), with a highest value of &gt;200 μg m
 <sup>−3</sup>. As a result, the O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations in SH were high, ranging from 180–200 μg m
 <sup>−3</sup>, resulting in a large anomaly of O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations (60 μg m
 <sup>−3</sup>) between the strong and the weak WPSH cases in Shanghai.
