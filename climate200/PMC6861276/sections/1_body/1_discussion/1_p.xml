<p id="Par6">Gao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) and Lin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) have demonstrated that the ozone concentrations in Shanghai steadily increase, with a strong seasonal variation. Because the effect of WPSH on O
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations often occurs in summer time, the monthly variation of ozone during 2013 to 2017 in the Shanghai region is analyzed and is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the 8h-averaged ozone (MDA8 O
 <sub>3</sub>) concentrations have highest occurrences in late-summer (July and August) compared with those in other months. The new Chinese national ambient air quality standards (CNAAQS2012, GB 3095–2012) has defined the severe, moderate, and slight ozone pollution

 </sup>. The total pollution days on July and August from 2013 to 2017 are 82 and 56 days, respectively. According to the study by Gao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017), the ozone concentrations are low in early summer (June), because of the occurrence of frequent precipitation in June which is named Meiyu-Baiu-Changma rain belt in China. Previous studies

 </sup> have demonstrate that the seasonal northward shifts of the WPSH are closely associated with the onset and withdrawal of the EASM, during July and August, the ridge of WPSH locate around Yangtze-Huaihe River region, and the weather conditions here are strongly controlled by the main body of WPSH system. As a result, it is important to understand the impact of WPSH on surface ozone in Shanghai during late-summer.
