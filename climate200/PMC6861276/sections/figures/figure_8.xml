  <p>The wind rose maps in the weak case (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the strong case (
   <bold>b</bold>) over Baoshan station (color bars represent different wind speed). The wind direction and wind speed data were measured at Shanghai Baoshan Climate Observatory. The maps were generated using NCL software [The NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2015). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5].
