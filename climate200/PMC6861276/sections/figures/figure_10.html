 <caption> Anomalies of the contributions of individual processes to O 3 formation (μg·m −3·day −1) in the Shanghai region in the strong and weak cases calculated by MOZART-4. The contributors include the ( a) total diffusion (DIF), ( b) advection (ADV) and ( c) gas-phase chemistry (CHEM). The maps were generated using NCL software [The NCAR Command Language (Version 6.3.0) [Software]. (2015). Boulder, Colorado: UCAR/NCAR/CISL/TDD. 10.5065/D6WD3XH5]. </caption>
