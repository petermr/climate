<p>To our knowledge, prevailing models for predicting the impacts of climate change on organisms have yet to thoroughly integrate the interplay of factors other than temperature and precipitation that contribute to how organisms respond to the “new,” shorter and warmer winters. It is abundantly evident that climate has a profound effect on organisms, as it serves as a cue for life history events. Climate change has resulted in global variations in the onset of seasons, delaying winter and advancing spring, thereby, providing a wider range of favorable temperatures for some organisms, resulting in the expansion of their growing seasons, but creating a misalignment between species and their ecological interactors (Donnelly, Caffarra, &amp; O'Neill, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Although nutrition, water, and temperature are the ultimate drivers of seasonal rhythms, plants and animals have evolved remarkably similar mechanisms to use day length (photoperiod) as a proximate cue for predicting the occurrence of these ultimate factors. Although a crucial cue influencing organisms’ phenophases and life histories, photoperiod has not been examined thoroughly in relation to climate change. This review will primarily focus on photoperiod‐induced annual events in birds and mammals.
