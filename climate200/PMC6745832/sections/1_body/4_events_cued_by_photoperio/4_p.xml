<p>During the past 30 years, evidence has mounted that artificial light during the night (ALAN) disrupts circadian rhythms and photoperiodic responses. Of note, ALAN does not alter the length of day, but does alter perceived day length. Abundant data demonstrate harmful effects caused by altering the natural photoperiod. For example, dim light at night (dLAN) alters short‐day regulation of reproduction in male Siberian hamsters (

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>); specifically, dLAN blunted nocturnal activity and altered the expression of genes implicated in photoperiodic response including,

 <italic>thyroid stimulating hormone receptor</italic>, 
 <italic>gonadotropin‐releasing hormone</italic>, and 
 <italic>gonadotropin‐inhibitory hormone</italic>. Additionally, these changes were associated with shifts in circadian clock gene expression (

 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), dLAN prolonged courting behavior, and altered oviposition patterns. LAN exposure of great tits (

 <italic>Turdus merula)</italic> advanced the timing of vernal gonad growth (Dominoni et al.,
