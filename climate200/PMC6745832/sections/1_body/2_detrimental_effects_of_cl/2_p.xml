<p>Just as some of the effects of climate change might seemingly benefit some species, not all organisms and phenophases are able to respond to temperature and precipitation changes and adapt accordingly. For instance, despite climate change increasing the number of days above freezing and lengthening the growing season for plants, there are studies that suggest climate change may have detrimental effects on plant growth. Mora et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) used climate projection models to assess how rising temperatures in combination with water availability and solar radiation might affect suitable growing days for plants by the year 2100. The authors demonstrate that despite increasing the number of days above freezing by up to 7%, the number of suitable growing days would drop by up to 11%. Further, this reduction in suitable growing days was more profound in tropical areas, as the number of suitable growing days was projected to be reduced by up to 200 plant growing days per year, as warming will likely exceed the upper threshold for plant growth.
