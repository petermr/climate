<p>Although not the first to describe humans' impact on the Earth's climate, Wallace Broecker is generally credited with coining the term “global warming” to describe the Earth's rising surface temperatures due to anthropogenic effects (Broecker,

Prior to 1975, scientists favored the terms “climate change” or “climate modification” as it was unclear what effect human activities might have on the Earth's climate. Today, it is apparent that the Earth's mean surface temperatures are on the rise. Indeed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported a linear trend demonstrating a warming of 0.85°C in land and ocean surface temperatures from 1880 to 2012. This trend shows no signs of slowing as global surface temperatures at the end of the 21st century are predicted to rise as high as 4.8°C relative to 1850–1900 surface temperatures (IPCC,
