<p>Additional examples of asynchrony between offspring birth and optimal nutrient availability have been reported in blue tits (
 <italic>Parus caeruleus</italic>) populations in France (Thomas, Blondel, Perret, Lambrechts, &amp; Speakman, 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). As in great tits, the blue tits use photoperiodic cues to commence breeding and reproduction and preferentially feed their young protein‐rich caterpillars. Global climate change has led to an advancement in caterpillar development without a concurrent advancement in hatching of the blue tit; thus, this mismatch has increased the metabolic cost of rearing young tits beyond the sustainable adult limit. Coincidentally, and possibly causally related, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of adults in the breeding population.
