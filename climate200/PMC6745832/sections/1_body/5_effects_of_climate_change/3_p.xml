<p>Desynchronization of offspring birth and optimal nutrient availability has been reported in great tits (
 <italic>Parus major</italic>) in the Netherlands (Visser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Despite consuming a variety of insects as part of their diet, great tits preferentially feed their young protein‐rich caterpillars. Driven by photoperiod cues during the spring, the great tit lays its eggs at a time that provides an adequate interval before hatching; this aligns with the timeframe during which caterpillar biomass availability is at its maximum. However, during the period of 1973–1995 an increase in temperature during the post‐egg‐laying period advanced the development and availability of caterpillars, without advancing hatch time of the great tits (Visser et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35537-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Consequently, a mismatch between offspring nutritional requirements and their availability ensued. It follows that great tits are now confronted with an evolutionary pressure to alter its reproductive phase to align with food availability. Clearly, to ensure the optimal survival of their offspring, the great tit is forced to advance its time of egg laying to match abiotic changes that cause the premature availability peak of its preferred fare. The laying date is not the only determinate in hatching date; synchrony can potentially be accomplished by reducing clutch size, by reducing the interval between laying of the last egg and incubation onset, or by reducing the overall time of incubation (Visser et al.,
