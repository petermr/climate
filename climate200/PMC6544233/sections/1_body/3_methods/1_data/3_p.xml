 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and links to the sources are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref> section 1. We increased the spatial resolution tracked to ~20,000 political units, and from four major crops being tracked–maize, rice, wheat, and soybean–to tracking the top ten global crops–barley, cassava, maize, oil palm, rapeseed, rice, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, and wheat. Further details of the crop data and the countries now being tracked at the sub-national levels (one or two levels below the national scale) are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</xref> section 1. The new political units were mapped using information from the public source GADM (
