<p>To conduct the study we used two datasets 1) climate and weather, and 2) crop yields and harvested areas. Climate and weather variables were all derived from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) TS4.01 [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] dataset and its previous data versions have been commonly used in previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
