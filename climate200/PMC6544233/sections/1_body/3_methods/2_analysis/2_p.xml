<p>Setting up our regression as time series analysis allows us to more accurately capture the effect of precipitation variations. This is because precipitation variations are highly heterogeneous and previous attempts that used panel regressions are less sensitive to precipitation variations [

The setting up of this form of the model is uniquely to answer only questions on climate trends/mean climate change impact on crop yields for historical and current conditions. To answer other questions such as identifying temperature thresholds beyond which crops have severe yield losses other forms of model specifications are required, such as an eighth-order polynomial function of temperature [
