<p>We have used a relatively simple statistical framework to tease out the main effects of changed climatic conditions on crop yields. A potential limitation of the analysis presented is that regression models were separately estimated within each geographical unit, thus we ignore spatial auto-correlations. Given our spatial scales–even though finer scaled compared to the country scale–each political unit nevertheless are hundreds to thousands of squared kilometers spatially–diffusion of agronomic knowledge and other socio-economic variables i.e. spatial autocorrelation effects would be relatively limited compared to analyses at much more finer spatial scales such as at village levels. Future studies should explore spatial and temporal multi-scale effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; we do not consider potential physical interaction between the explanatory variables at different scales in different geographical units. We would also like to caveat against interpreting our regression-based analysis as causality. Needless to say, detailed studies using technically more complex statistical models, including causal models, and more extensive model diagnostics, is needed. Ignoring spatial autocorrelation does not necessarily bias the final results, however inclusion of such effects may improve the precision of the estimates. On the other hand, spatio-temporal statistical models can be computationally and mathematically very challenging. Future publications should try to address spatio-temporal dependency, diagnostics associated with statistical modeling and other issues mentioned above in global-scale studies.
