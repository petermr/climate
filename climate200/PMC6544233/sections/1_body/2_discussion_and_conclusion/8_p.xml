<p>Our findings here illustrate that climate change has potentially already affected global production of the ten largest crops and the production of consumable food calories in specific countries and globally. The approach used here complements the long-range projections, avoids many of the challenges faced by process-based models, and analyzes a broader set of crops. Although recent climate change has likely reduced overall consumable food calories in these ten crops by ~1% (or ~0.5% across all food calories), there is much variability among crops and regions. These findings can be used to target interventions for adaptation to climate change through better management, crop breeding, and switching crops as climate continues to evolve.</p>
