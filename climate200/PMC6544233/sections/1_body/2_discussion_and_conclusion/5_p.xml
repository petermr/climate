<p>We tracked ~20,000 political units globally for 10 crops, providing more detail on the spatial resolution and a larger number of crops than previously studied [

Some such as cassava and sorghum are a major source of calories in food insecure regions (~3.5% and ~3.4% of total food calories provided respectively). Sugarcane, oil palm and rapeseed are important commodity crops with the latter two having greatly expanded in recent decades. Another implicit advancement in our report is from computing the harvested area weighted weather statistics from reported harvesting information each year at the unit of the study ~20,000 political units.
