<p>We find a range of impacts of mean climate change on crop yields (

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s017">S4 Table</xref>) and production in different regions. We found that crop yields across Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia had in general decreased because of climate change, though exceptions are present. Similar variations are seen in other crops and regions all over the world. They are indicative of the underlying variations of agronomic growing conditions that range from the agro-meteorological to crop management. Precipitation variations for example are much heterogeneous in their trends (
