<p>Previous assessments of climate change impact on crop yields commonly combine future climate scenarios and process-based crop models to project future yields for a limited number of crops for 2050 or later [

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At higher levels of warming, strong yield losses are predicted in lower latitudes especially for maize and wheat crops [

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and in the crop model parameters [

 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, the distant time horizon, small number of crops, and coarse resolution limit the results’ utility for stakeholders and policy makers to develop goals and strategies.
