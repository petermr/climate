<p>Assessing the impacts of recent climate change complements long-term forecasts and identifies which crops and places are already at greater risk. Since the 1970s, global surface temperature warmed at an average of 0.16°C to 0.18°C per decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0217148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a rate higher than any period since the industrial revolution. During that same period, we find that the growing season temperature, over all harvested areas for the top ten global crops–barley, cassava, maize, rice, oil palm, rapeseed, sorghum, sugarcane, soybean and wheat–increased 0.5°C to 1.2°C (
