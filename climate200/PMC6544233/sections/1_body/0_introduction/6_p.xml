<p>We base quantitative conclusions on models that are statistically significant (ANOVA F-statistic at p &lt; 0.05 level) and are applied within the domain of observed variables used in model construction (Methods below; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s006">S5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s007">S6</xref> Figs). We applied models in the political units in which they were constructed. We confirmed that yield predictions were made only with historical and current climate conditions that were within the range of the observed weather used for model construction (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s008">S7 Fig</xref>) indicating that these models were robust relative to data quality issues. Cross validation of the model predicted yields, against observations, showed low average (2009 to 2013) harvested-area-weighted errors globally (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s015">S2 Table</xref>), and generally also low errors at the political units for individual crops (Methods below and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). The model coefficients of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>) at the global level ranged from 0.76 (sorghum) to 0.87 (rice) (
