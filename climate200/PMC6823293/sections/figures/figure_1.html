 <caption> Summary statistics and distributional information for all dependent variables (see Table  2) across the four cells of the experimental design. Bars represent cell means and error bars are 95% bootstrapped ( N= 1,000 samples) confidence intervals. Data points within violin plots are jittered to avoid over-printing. a Unaffected; b Support; c AGW, which is average of responses to items agw1, agw2, agw3, agw4, and agw5 after reverse scoring; d ReaderCons; e SciCons; f pairwise correlations between AGW and ReaderCons for all four conditions. The consensus items ( ReaderCons and SciCons) use a percentage scale (0–100) and all other items use a five-point scale from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” See Table  2 for wording of the test items </caption>
