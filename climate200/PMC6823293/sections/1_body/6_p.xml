<p id="Par9">In the context of scientific issues such as climate change or vaccinations, providing information about a consensus among experts has similarly been shown to nudge people’s attitudes towards the scientific mainstream (Lewandowsky, Gignac, &amp; Vaughan, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>; van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Feinberg, &amp; Maibach, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>; van der Linden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). Perception of the scientific consensus has been identified as a “gateway belief”; that is, a crucial conceptual underpinning of numerous climate-related beliefs (Ding, Maibach, Zhao, Roser-Renouf, &amp; Leiserowitz, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>; McCright, Dunlap, &amp; Xiao, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>; Stenhouse et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2014</xref>; van der Linden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>). Conversely, highlighting of only a few dissenting views on climate change can undermine the perception of a scientific consensus and the need for expert guidance during policy development, even when numeric information about the extent of expert agreement is available (Koehler,
