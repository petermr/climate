Even very subtle cues, such as a few people staring at the top of a building in a public place, can cause others to change their behavior, for example by following suit and looking up themselves (Gallup et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>). Given that YouTube views and “likes” can be purchased in bulk for very little money on the black market (NATO StratCom COE,
