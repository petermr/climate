<p id="Par27">The perceived consensus among blog readers (item 
 <italic>ReaderCons</italic>) was affected neither by the type of post, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) &lt; 1, nor the type of comments, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) &lt; 1, but it was strongly affected by the interaction of both variables, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) = 50.44,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, partial 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = .115, Cohen’s 
 <italic>F</italic> = .360. That is, similar to people’s expressed support for the blog post, their perception of consensus among readers was greatest when the comments were consonant with the post (both rejecting or both endorsing AGW) as opposed to when there was a mismatch in polarity. The subset analysis of careful readers additionally returned a main effect of type of post, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,179) = 5.80,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02, reflecting the fact that more readers were presumed to endorse the science-based post than its contrarian counterpart.
