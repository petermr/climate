<p id="Par25">People’s support for the blog post (item 
 <italic>Support</italic>) was not affected by the type of post, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) &lt; 1, or the type of comments, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) &lt; 1, although there was strong evidence for the interaction of both variables, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) = 10.75,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, partial 
 <italic>η</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = .027, Cohen’s 
 <italic>F</italic> = .166. This reflected the fact that when the post and comments were of the same type (both rejecting or both endorsing AGW), people supported the post more than when the polarities of the post and the comments were in opposition. This result establishes that reading the comments affected people’s views of the post. Supportive comments enhanced endorsement of the post whereas critical comments undermined that support.
