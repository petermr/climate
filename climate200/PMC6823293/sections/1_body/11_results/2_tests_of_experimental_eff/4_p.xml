 <sup>2</sup> = .035, Cohen’s 
 <italic>F</italic> = .192, indicating that people accepted global warming more after reading the post supporting mainstream science than after reading a contrarian post. The interaction between the two variables was non-significant, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,389) = 1.42,
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1. In this instance, however, the subset analysis of careful readers additionally returned a main effect of type of comment, 
 <italic>F</italic>(1,179) = 6.58,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02, reflecting the fact that contrarian comments reduced acceptance of the mainstream science among careful readers.
