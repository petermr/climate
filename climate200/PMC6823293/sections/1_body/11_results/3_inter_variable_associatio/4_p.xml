<p id="Par35">The first model is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Both experimental variables and their interaction were used to predict AGW directly and indirectly, via the presumed mediator of reflected perceived reader consensus. This model was found to fit acceptably well,

 <italic>SRMR</italic>= .049. However, several of the estimated effects were not statistically significant (indicated by dashed lines in the figure). In particular, the interaction between the two experimental variables, type of post and type of comments (TP × TC), was not associated with either a direct (
 <italic>b</italic> = −.16,
 <italic>β</italic> = −.11,
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22) or indirect (
 <italic>b</italic> = .01,
 <italic>β</italic> = .01,
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.79) effect on 
 <italic>AGW</italic>. Furthermore, the type of comments (TC) did not have a direct effect on 
 <italic>AGW</italic> (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.75).
