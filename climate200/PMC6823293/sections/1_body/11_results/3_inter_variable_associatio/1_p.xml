<p id="Par32">This analysis modeled people’s acceptance of AGW as a function of the two experimental design variables and perceived endorsement among readers. We applied process analysis (Hayes, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>) to model the relation between those intertwined variables. We first devised a measurement model associated with the five items that queried climate attitudes (items 
 <italic>agw1</italic> though 
 <italic>agw5</italic>). The single-factor model associated with an AGW latent variable was found to be moderately well-fitting, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(5) = 66.64,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>F</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .910,
 <italic>T</italic>
 <italic>L</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .821, 
 <italic>RMSEA</italic>= .177, 
 <italic>SRMR</italic>= .069. However, there was an indication that a non-negligible amount of covariance was shared between the two items with negative polarity, 
 <italic>agw1</italic> and 
 <italic>agw5</italic> (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). With the addition of the covariance between these two items (
 <italic>r</italic> = .40,
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), the model fit substantially better, 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>(4) = 6.39,
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>F</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .997, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <italic>L</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> = .991, 
 <italic>RMSEA</italic>= .039, 
 <italic>SRMR</italic>= .017. We therefore used this single-factor latent variable as our criterion variable for the remaining modeling.
