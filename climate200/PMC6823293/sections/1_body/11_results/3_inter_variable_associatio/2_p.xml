<p id="Par33">We next examined some of the key bivariate correlations. The association between perceived scientific consensus (
 <italic>SciCons</italic>) and the AGW latent variable was large, 
 <italic>r</italic> = .59,95
 <italic>%</italic>
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> : .51,.66, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001. By contrast, the overall correlation between perceived consensus among readers (
 <italic>ReaderCons</italic>) and the AGW latent variable escaped significance, 
 <italic>r</italic> = .10,95
 <italic>%</italic>
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> : −.03,.22, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05. The overall absence of a correlation is unsurprising in light of the opposing directions of the relationship between reader consensus and endorsement of AGW across conditions (shown in panel f in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For the posts that rejected science, the correlations between perceived reader consensus and the AGW latent variables were negative/near zero (
 <italic>r</italic> = −.16 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = .05), whereas they were positive for the posts that endorsed the mainstream scientific position (
 <italic>r</italic> = .45 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = .25). The reversed directionality between types of post points to a coherent role of the presumed prevalence among readers of support for the scientific position. That is, a negative correlation between the presumed share of readers who endorsed a rejectionist post is equivalent to a positive association between the share of readers who disagreed with that post and, by implication, endorsed the mainstream scientific position. Thus, to simplify presentation of the results, the perceived reader consensus scores provided by participants who were exposed to the rejectionist post were therefore reflected to express 
 <italic>dissensus</italic> with the post (i.e., 100 - 
 <italic>ReaderCons</italic> score). This reflected score represented the perceived endorsement of mainstream science among readers. This reflected measure behaved consistently across conditions was found to correlate moderately with AGW across all conditions, 
 <italic>r</italic> = .25,95
 <italic>%</italic>
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> : .12,.37, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001.
