<p id="Par34">Finally, we estimated the correlations between the two experimental variables, type of post and type of comments, and the AGW latent variable. For both experimental variables, endorsement of AGW was coded as 1 and rejection as 0. The correlations were

 <italic>%</italic>
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> : .07,.27, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003 for type of post, and

 <italic>%</italic>
 <italic>C</italic>
 <italic>I</italic> : −.08,.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.520 for type of comments, respectively. Those correlations mirror the ANOVAs reported in the previous section, and they confirm that there was no direct (or total) effect between one of the key experimental variables, type of comments, and AGW. However, contemporary process analysis does not require the presence of a significant total effect, as the observation of an indirect effect by itself is considered sufficient (Hayes,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2004</xref>; Mathieu &amp; Taylor, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>; MacKinnon, Krull, &amp; Lockwood, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2000</xref>). We therefore explored several candidate process models to explore whether the type of comment may still affect AGW attitudes via an indirect route.
