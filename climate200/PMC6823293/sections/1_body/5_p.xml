<p id="Par8">However, copying others’ behavior is neither universal nor necessarily always adaptive: Conformity may be advisable when asocial learning (i.e., individual exploration and learning directly from the environment) is impossible or costly, or when people are uncertain about their own views (Kendal et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Under those circumstances, people tend to copy the behavior or opinion of a majority, and this tendency increases with the size of the majority (Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>). The fact that conformity increases with the size of the majority is adaptive and rational because larger groups of independent actors will provide more reliable information than small groups (Muthukrishna, Morgan, &amp; Henrich, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). When the size of the majority becomes overwhelming, conformity effects are also known as “consensus effects.” Much prior work has focused on how a social consensus can affect opinions relating to stereotypes and discrimination. For example, if a participant receives (experimentally manipulated) information about the predominant attitudes among his or her peers—viz. how they view minority groups—then the person’s own attitude tends to shift in the direction of the purported consensus (Puhl, Schwartz, &amp; Brownell, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2005</xref>; Stangor, Sechrist, &amp; Jost, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2001</xref>; Zitek &amp; Hebl, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2007</xref>). The effect is enhanced if the consensus involves members of one’s in-group, and it can be long-lasting and is detectable outside the context of the initial manipulation (Stangor et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2001</xref>).
