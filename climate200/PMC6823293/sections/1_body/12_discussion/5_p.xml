<p id="Par42">Turning to theoretical implications, we have framed our study and results in terms of the importance of the perceived consensus on attitudes towards scientific issues. There is growing evidence that knowledge of the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change can shift people’s AGW attitudes (Cook &amp; Lewandowsky,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>; Lewandowsky et al.,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2018</xref>). Likewise, knowledge of the consensus among medical scientists about the efficacy of vaccinations has been shown to increase public support for vaccines, and concomitantly reduce concern about their safety (van der Linden et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). Our results are fully consonant with those findings but additionally extend the importance of perceived consensus to other sources, in this case anonymous other readers of blogs. Our result meshes well with a recent study by Harris et al., (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>), who examined the efficacy of various consensus-based messages on shifting people’s attitudes towards climate change. One of their studies used an American online sample and is thus comparable to the present experiment. Harris et al., found that the most effective way to communicate the scientific consensus was by “experiencing” it—that is, by being exposed to individual opinions from a number of scientists—as opposed to being given a summary statistic (e.g., “97 out of 100 scientists agree on AGW”). Their results confirm the power of experiential exposure to opinions; we extend those results by showing that even anonymous voices with unknown expertise can shape people’s experience of an opinion-relevant consensus.
