   <title>Appendix A: Bayesian analysis</title>
   <p id="Par45">We used the BayesFactor package for R (Morey, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2015</xref>) with the “bottom” option, which adds single effects one at a time in comparison to the null model. The BayesFactor package calculates the Bayes factor (BF) for pairwise model comparisons, using default priors on the effect sizes included in a model (Rouder, Morey, Speckman, &amp; Province, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). The BF reflects the relative strength of evidence for one model over the other that is provided by the data, independent of the researcher’s prior beliefs. Bayes factors quantify the strength of evidence on a continuous scale, and unlike with 
    <italic>p</italic> values, there is no conventional cut-off. A BF equal to 1 reflects complete ambiguity in which the evidence favors both models equally; BFs between 1 and 3 are considered weak evidence, BFs between 3 and 10 as intermediate, BF &gt; 10 as strong evidence, and BF &gt; 100 as decisive evidence in favor of one model against the other (Kass &amp; Raftery, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1995</xref>). When the BF falls below one, its reciprocal can be interpreted in the same manner but with reverse polarity—that is, a Bayes Factor of 0.1 for a given model is actually strong evidence (1/0.1 = 10) 
    <italic>against</italic> it (and in favor of the other model).
   </p>
   <p id="Par46">The Bayesian analyses on the full sample of participants largely paralleled the results of the frequentist analysis. For the 
    <italic>Unaffected</italic> item, there was no evidence for the inclusion of either main effect or the interaction compared to a null model with the grand mean only; largest BF = 0.15. People’s support for the blog post (item 
    <italic>Support</italic>) was not affected by the type of post (BF = 0.11) or the type of comments (BF = 0.11), although there was strong evidence for the interaction of both variables (BF = 19.04). The 
    <italic>AGW</italic> composite score was unaffected by the type of comments (BF = 0.21) or the interaction (BF = 0.19), although there was very strong evidence of a role of the type of post (BF = 80.74).
   </p>
   <p id="Par47">For the two consensus items, the perceived consensus among blog readers was affected neither by the type of post (BF = 0.12) nor the type of comments (BF = 0.12), but it was decisively affected by the interaction of both variables (BF = 1.50 × 10
    <sup>8</sup>). For the presumed consensus among scientists (
    <italic>SciCons</italic>), by contrast, what mattered strongly was the type of post (BF = 42.84) but not the comments (BF = 0.11) or the interaction (BF = 0.79).
