 </xref> A 2015 review on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome found 21 studies showing a mainly positive influence of temperature and humidity. Yet, an inconclusive association was found with rainfall. The review also highlighted the importance of distinguishing the different effects between the Seoul virus (mainly urban) and Hantaan virus (rural), which are associated with different rodent hosts.
