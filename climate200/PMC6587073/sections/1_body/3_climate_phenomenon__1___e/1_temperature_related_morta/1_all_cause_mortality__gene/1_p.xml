<p>The relationship between temperature and mortality has been studied globally, and in China, this is also the most frequently studied climate change and health outcome. Although increased mortality risk occurs in both cold and hot temperatures, larger proportion of temperature-related mortality attributed to cold rather than hot temperatures.
