<p>As limited reviews have been conducted in the developing context, our review highlights a wide range of topics and provides evidence to understand the development of climate and health research after the millennium. Rapid urbanization is taking place in many developing countries in Asia, and the experience of urban China is of significant reference for other places of similar latitude and socioeconomic development. Our review is presented in a framework that allows readers to see the links between climate change and its health impacts. The findings will probably serve as good reference for other developing context to build their climate change and health outcome models, to better support health and medical needs and service planning. However, this was not a systematic review and out of the scope of this review were related topics such as air pollution, co-benefits, acclimatization, adaptation, behavioral change and other indirect impacts of climate change. These are highly important topics as some of these issues involve protective factors like social support and help-seeking behaviors, which could improve the health outcomes.</p>
