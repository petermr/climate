<p>Our findings indicated that the temperature–mortality association is the most extensively researched issue in China and found both hot and cold temperatures increased mortality risk. Yet, most studies tend to focus on one indicator and typically under a 5- or 10-year timeframe. Temperature-related morbidities are much less understood and should be given more attention, particularly as cause-specific morbidity studies are important for informing targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. There is currently a lack of literature that examines how climate variation may affect comorbidities, injuries, mental health and allergies. Understanding on both mortality and morbidity is critical as the former can be applied to warning thresholds and policy planning, and the latter for health and related service planning. Building on the existing findings on temperature–mortality association, researchers should also consider conducting longer time trends and scenario-based projection studies on the health impacts of extreme temperatures to facilitate public health planning and risk reduction efforts.</p>
