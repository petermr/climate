<p>We screened 900 of the best-match articles in both English and Chinese by title and abstract. Additionally, we searched for the latest relevant publications. A total of 196 papers were considered relevant with the full text reviewed. Our review indicated that majority of the published papers on health impact of climate change in Chinese cities are in English. These publications were mostly published after 2010 and were observation studies by nature. Most of the studies were ecological time-series studies, while there were several cross-sectional survey studies (particularly related to mental health) and a few spatial analysis studies. However, overall, there were very few cohort studies conducted on climate change and health in China. Table 
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that the typical length of studies was under 5 years. The maximum length of a study dataset was 46 years. Our review also found nine studies on future projections.
