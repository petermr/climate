 <caption> Ordination diagram of non-linear multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis. Species data were square-root transformed, and the analysis used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure. 3a shows plots from both sites and mowing treatments. Solid red lines show standard error ellipses (confidence limit = 0.95) calculated from the sample scores for the mown plots; dashed blue lines for the unmown plots. Position of centroids are shown by ellipse labels. Succession indicating species ( M. caerulea, B. nana and B. pubescens) are shown in bold. Black arrows show length and direction of significant environmental variables ( P &lt; 0.01) where the labels are underlined: mean peat depth (cm), slope angle (Â°), pH of water, median groundwater level (GWL) (m) and maximum groundwater level (m). Site types: Cm = continental mown ( n = 17); Cu = continental unmown ( n = 17); Om = oceanic mown ( n = 13); Ou = oceanic unmown ( n = 13). 3b shows plots from both sites and mowing treatments, and specialist fen species (see Table 1 and S2 Table). See S2 Table for species abbreviations and summary data on changes in cover of individual species. </caption>
