Change in M. caerulea cover (%) (A), change in shrub cover (%) (B), change in specialist vascular plant cover (%) (C) and change in specialist bryophyte cover (%) (D). Site types: Cm = continental mown ( n = 17); Cu = continental unmown ( n = 17); Om = oceanic mown ( n = 13); Ou = oceanic unmown ( n = 13). ***: P ≤ 0.001; **: P ≤ 0.01; *: P ≤ 0.05 for significant differences between means of unmown and mown plots at each site in Tukey post hoc tests. </caption>
