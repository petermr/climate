<p>Detailed botanical and environmental monitoring over a period of many decades provides a rare opportunity to assess vegetation change driven by land management and climate change over an ecologically-significant timescale, and to integrate climate change into management strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we used data from a historical dataset on boreal fens based on permanent plots established in the late 1960s and early 1970s at an oceanic and a continental site in Central Norway [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], to assess long-term change in parallel communities of abandoned and harvested fens (overgrown for &gt;60 years and mown for 30 years respectively). We are thus able to address the long-term effect of mowing under different climatic regimes. We used a re-survey approach to (1) assess how fen vegetation has changed over this period, both with and without mowing, in terms of species composition and diversity, (2) examine how the impact of mowing varies with climatic and environmental differences between oceanic and continental areas, and (3) provide evidence as to whether mowing is an effective restoration tool for boreal fens.
