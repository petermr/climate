<p>Although we found that mowing was an important determinant of fen vegetation, climate change is also likely to have been important. The increase in temperature between the surveys is likely to have increased fen productivity at both sites, presenting a further threat to habitat specialists, as the lowering of soil moisture is disastrous for fen vegetation [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The temperature of fen soils is generally less variable and less extreme than air temperatures, suggesting a buffer effect of groundwater systems that may render them relatively resilient to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This explains the wide distribution range of many fen species in Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, the cool waters from underground aquifers that saturate fens are expected to keep temperatures lower during warm periods and vice versa [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, the buffer effect is likely to be reduced in warmer temperatures, when the soils are relatively sensitive to air temperature through being less water-saturated because of warmer air and solar radiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Fens may also be extremely sensitive to the predicted changes in precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which could further compromise the buffer effect. An oceanic climate is characterised by high precipitation and humidity, with a higher frequency of waterlogging than continental areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, because of the higher paludification rate caused by the humid conditions in oceanic regions, fens in such regions often include steep sloping fens which have drier peat than flatter fens in continental areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite these factors, mowing can have an even greater effect; land management was also shown to be more important than climate change in its effects on grassland functioning [
