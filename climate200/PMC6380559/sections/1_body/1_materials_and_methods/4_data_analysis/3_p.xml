<p>Multivariate analyses were performed using non-linear multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) (
 <italic>metaMDS</italic>) on the species data, which were square-root transformed and the analysis used the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measure. NMDS was selected as the preferred type of analysis as it has been shown to be robust for nonlinear relationships of species abundances along long ecological gradients, accurately representing underlying dissimilarities [
 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The environmental variables (slope angle (°), mean peat depth (cm), pH of water, electrical conductivity, (μS/cm), above-ground production (g/m
 <sup>2</sup>), and the groundwater variables detailed above) were fitted on to the ordination using 
 <italic>envfit</italic>. An ordination diagram was plotted showing the unmown and mown plots from both sites, the fen specialist and species indicative of succession and fen discontinuity (
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>caerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>Betula</italic> species), and the significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) environmental variables (mean peat depth, slope angle, pH of water, median groundwater level and maximum groundwater level). As some of the groundwater variables were collinear, only those that were significant and had the highest R
 <sup>2</sup> values were included. Linear regression was used to test the significance of the changes in temperature (°C) and precipitation sums (mm) over time (

 <italic>caerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>Betula nana</italic> and 
 <italic>Betula pubescens</italic>, were tested for significant differences between the initial and unmown and initial and mown plots using paired t-tests (

 <italic>test</italic>). In view of the large number of tests, a more rigorous significance cut-off was applied when testing for differences in species cover, with only 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 being considered significant, and the species data were log-transformed using the common logarithm (log
 <sub>10</sub>) prior to analysis.
