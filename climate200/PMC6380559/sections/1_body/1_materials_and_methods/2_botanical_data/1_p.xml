<p>The localities at both sites (17 from the continental site, 13 from the oceanic) were established between 1967 and 1983 in selected areas of homogeneous vegetation, where permanent plots of 25m
 <sup>2</sup> were marked and initial phytosociological analyses made. Half of the plot (or an adjacent plot) in each locality has then been mown regularly every second year in the first half of August, resembling the traditional use of these areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0211272.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The other 12.5m
 <sup>2</sup> was set aside as a reference plot and left unmown. The plots were re-surveyed between 2012 and 2015. In each locality, therefore, phytosociological data exist for the following three types of plots: “initial”, analysed &gt;40 years ago, after being unmown for &gt;20 years (25 m
 <sup>2</sup>); “re-survey unmown”, unmown for &gt;60 years (12.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>); “resurvey mown”, plots that, after being unmown for &gt;20 years, have been mown every second year for &gt; 30 years (12.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>). Based on studies of the species-area curve in these vegetation, the 25m
 <sup>2</sup> plots include 6% more species than the 12.5m
 <sup>2</sup> plots (Øien &amp; Moen, unpublished data). This gives rise to the four site types into which plots are classified and which we used in analysis, where the first letter refers to the site (continental (C) or oceanic (O), the second to the change between the initial survey and either the unmown (u) or mown (m) plots of the re-survey, i.e. Cu, Cm, Ou and Om.
