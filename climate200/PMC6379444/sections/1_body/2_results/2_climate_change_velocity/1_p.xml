<p id="Par13">To briefly recap, climate change velocities were calculated as ratios of Mann-Kendall temporal trends and absolute values of spatial gradients, so negative velocities correspond to a negative climatic trend and positive ones to a positive climatic trend. Since not many statistically significant temporal trends were detected in the period 1901–1950, we focused on estimating climate velocities for the recent period from 1951 to 2015. As described in the Supplementary Information, we categorised values of climate change velocities for each variable and season by analysing their respective histograms. Almost 90% of climate change velocities for both maximum and minimum temperature were contained within the range of (−0.5 km/year to 3 km/year) (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The majority of those values for maximum temperature are in the range −0.5 km/year to 3 km/year and for minimum temperature in the range (−0.5 km/year to 1.5 km/year), (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Supplementary Information). Spring velocity for Tmax showed the highest values of 1.5 km/year, and this covers 3.58% of Germany, whereas for Tmin the highest positive velocity is detected for the Winter season, covering 16.88% of Germany. Climate change velocities for both minimum and maximum temperatures were higher in northern Germany and in topographically low elevation areas, whereas in mountain areas the velocities were lower.
