<p id="Par5">Beside trend analysis to estimate the magnitude and direction of climate change, the most commonly used metric to estimate the potential impact of climate change on biodiversity is climate change velocity
 <sup>

 </sup>. Climate velocity has been defined as the speed at which species will need to migrate in order to stay in the same enveloped climatic condition
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. Previous studies analysing climate change velocity have aimed to better understand species extinction risk
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup> or the expected vector of past and future biological migrants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. It is known that some plant species only partly track trends in recent climate change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, and the velocity of how fast they should move has differed from the observed migration. Such ‘migration lag’ in plants can be related to changes in multiple climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation) and different types of lags (i.e. dispersal lag, establishment lag and extinction lag)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. This could impact various trophic levels, for example change animal migration rates caused by the loss of nutrition or habitat

 </sup>. An example, by Chivers 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, has shown that phytoplankton responses to climate change were highly variable; some taxa closely tracked climate velocity, while other taxa showed no response. Such research is starting to explain responses to climate change at the species level, which is necessary to enable us to make realistic projections of species change in the current and the next century.
