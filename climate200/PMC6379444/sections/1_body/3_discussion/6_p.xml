<p id="Par20">Data based studies like the one we present here can help to further explore the causal links and attribution of species shifts across multiple taxa to local and regional climate variability. Species from multiple taxonomic groups have different climatic requirements and heterogeneous responses to climate change (i.e. either on the individualistic or population level) that are not fully understood

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. Some studies have used biotic velocity (metrics developed based on climatic niche models)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>, and have analysed plant species vulnerability (on a population level) to local climate change velocity and their migration abilities (i.e. dispersal abilities)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>. Still, such studies use species distribution data from range maps which are scale dependent, and this could overestimate the presence of a particular species. In other words, they do not use species occurrence data

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>
 </sup> and, in order to better understand to what extent species have followed previous climate change velocity at the local and regional scales, we need studies based on occurrence data. Such studies can serve as a guide to estimating the rate of future ecological migrations driven by climate velocity.
