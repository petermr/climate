<p>The term “stunting” refers to the impaired physical growth and development that results from inadequate nutrition and repeated infections with, for example, diarrheal diseases that reduce nutrient uptake. Stunted children are short for their age. They also may have impaired cognitive development, which can interfere with schooling and, thus, their ability to earn a living later.
