<p>Stunting affects up to 155 million children aged 5 or younger worldwide,
 <xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> making it an all-too-common threat to global health. Some investigators have suggested that climate change may impair progress on stunting reduction. That’s because higher temperatures and altered rainfall patterns are projected to reduce crop yield, decreasing the amount of food that is available,
 <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> as well as potentially altering some food’s nutritional content.
 <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A recent study in 
 <italic>Environmental Health Perspectives</italic> broadens that line of inquiry by modeling the complex interactions between climate change and the socioeconomic factors that govern stunting rates.
