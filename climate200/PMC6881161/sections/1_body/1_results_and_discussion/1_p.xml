<p>To determine how climate change will affect New Guinea’s biodiversity, we first quantified current species richness using 2353 New Guinea endemic species with presences in ≥5 grid cells and whose modeled current ranges are significantly different from a bias-corrected null model (see Materials and Methods). We find that mean species richness (at 5–arc min spatial resolution) is 711, with the highest values occurring in the northern half of New Guinea (
