<p>Given differences across ecoregions and language areas in future potential reductions in species richness, where should decision-makers focus to maximize conservation gains? An answer to this question depends on which features are selected. This selection, in turn, is subjective and will vary across stakeholders. Accordingly, we considered two viewpoints that span a continuum from biologically driven to locally involved conservation planning. The first view places equal value on all biodiversity features and can be considered typical among conservation planners who value species richness, irrespective of species’ utility. For this view, we modeled conservation priorities for all 2353 endemic species (see Materials and Methods; 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The second view focuses on species that are important for indigenous livelihoods and approximates a socially driven viewpoint in which conservation focuses on livelihoods or on species that provide construction, culture, food, and medicinal services (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B to F</xref>). We find that the central mountain range emerges among the top 10% priorities under climate change for all endemic plant species as well as for each use category (red in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), despite a projected loss of species richness (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). That the central range is identified as a priority while also projected to become unsuitable for a large number of currently extant species is explained by the (i) smaller average range size of species currently present and projected to persist in high elevations, (ii) reductions in range size (and thus an increase in importance) as species shift upslope, and (iii) highlands serving as a “sink” for surrounding low- and mid-elevation species. When comparing both views, we found strong spatial congruence in their top 10% solutions (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These highly congruent top priority conservation areas occur in 28 administrative units, and some transcend single-administrative, cultural (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), or country boundaries, underscoring the strong need for interadministrative, intercultural, and international transboundary planning.
