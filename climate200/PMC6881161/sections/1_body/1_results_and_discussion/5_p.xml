<p>Despite high levels of species richness and endemism, New Guinea remains one of the most botanically undercollected regions in the Asia-Pacific (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>). Our study is therefore constrained by low collection densities of generally &lt;25 collections per 100 km
 <sup>2</sup>—well under the benchmark minimum of 50 to 100 collections per 100 km
 <sup>2</sup> for adequate floristic inventories (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>13</italic>
 </xref>). In addition, specimen collections are spatially biased in several notable ways: Collection density is lower in western and southwestern New Guinea, is highest in montane ecosystems, and tends to be concentrated around roads, waterways, and major communities. Another limitation of our study is that our SDMs assume that species niches are at equilibrium with their current climate envelope and stable across time. Our modeling approach also does not integrate biotic interactions (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>), species-level dispersal information (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>), or potential adaptation and evolution (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>21</italic>
 </xref>), which are known to influence species responses to climate change but for which data are lacking for most taxa. Documentation of New Guinea’s useful species is still incipient: Only 19% of the region’s indigenous groups appear in the ethnobotanical literature, and most studies have been fragmentary (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>12</italic>
 </xref>). This translates in that 60% of the 720 modeled endemic useful species were reported in the literature by a single indigenous group and 40% were reported by at least two groups. Thus, our analyses within language areas explore all potentially available endemic useful species, although these may not yet be known locally. Last, we did not include land cost in our analyses, as land use in New Guinea is controlled by a complex mixture of traditional tenure and government land use planning, which varies between countries. Formal acquisition cost is seldom an issue in either setting, but opportunity costs may be substantial.
