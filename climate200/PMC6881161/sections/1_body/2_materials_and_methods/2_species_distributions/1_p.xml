<p>Herbarium specimen records were downloaded from the online databases Global Biodiversity Information Facility (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</ext-link>) and Consortium of Pacific Herbaria (

We manually unified headers and standardized entries for the fields “family,” “genus,” “species,” “collector name,” “collector number,” and “date.” All records from outside the study area were removed, and endemic species were identified following Flora Malesiana accounts (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.floramalesiana.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.floramalesiana.org</ext-link>) and taxonomic literature. Collectors’ names were verified using the Cyclopaedia of Malesian collectors (

After discarding duplicate records and obvious coordinate errors (i.e., points in the ocean and outside New Guinea), there were 3053 endemic species with at least five occurrences in separate grid cells.
