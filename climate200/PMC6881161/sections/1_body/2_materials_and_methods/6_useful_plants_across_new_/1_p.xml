<p>To select which of the significant SDMs are used by indigenous people, we queried a list of New Guinea useful plants that synthesizes information from 488 references published between 1885 and 2018 (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>12</italic>
 </xref>). There were 720 useful species in our significant SDMs, representing 67% of all known 1070 endemic useful species of New Guinea. The 720 species belong to 100 plant families, the most diverse being Arecaceae (44 species), Rubiaceae (37), Ericaceae (36), Elaeocarpaceae (33), and Myrtaceae (31). Useful species have 3333 different uses (71% of known uses from New Guinea’s endemic species), including food (
 <italic>n</italic> = 162 species; 232 uses), medicine (
 <italic>n</italic> = 187; 522), culture (
 <italic>n</italic> = 271; 415), and construction (
 <italic>n</italic> = 374; 824). The 720 useful species are cited by a total of 93 indigenous groups, with 60% of species cited by one indigenous group and 40% cited by at least two indigenous groups. To map useful plant species richness across New Guinea’s indigenous lands, we intersected the stacked SDMs of useful species with 1030 language areas of Ethnologue (

 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>). We used language as an indicator of a cultural group because language is the primary medium of cultural transmission (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>38</italic>
 </xref>). Differences in species richness between current and future climate (2070 RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5) were calculated for each language area. To explore the relationship between future changes in species richness and language endangerment, we obtained the language endangerment classification for all indigenous groups in our sample from Ethnologue (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>), which uses the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>). All SDM analyses were performed in R (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>40</italic>
 </xref>) using commands from the libraries dismo (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">

 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">
