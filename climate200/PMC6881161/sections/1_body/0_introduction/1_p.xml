<p>New Guinea is the largest and most bioculturally diverse island on Earth (

 </xref>). Biologically, it harbors c. 14,000 native plant species and 9000 endemic species, making it the only island group in Malesia with more endemic than non-endemic plant species (

 </xref>). Human-driven climate change, however, is expected to become a threat to New Guinea’s biocultural diversity: changes in climate are already affecting species’ distribution patterns elsewhere (

 </xref>) with negative consequences on ecosystems functioning and human well-being (

 </xref>). Because most New Guinea cultures are supported by low-income populations that rely on their surrounding natural resources, climate-induced local extinction of wild food, medicine, and ritual plants is likely to diminish indigenous well-being and cultural integrity. Accordingly, understanding the potential impacts of climate change on New Guinea’s biocultural diversity is essential for a strategic expansion of protected area networks and conservation lands in ways that protect and reinforce biocultural traditions and the rights of indigenous peoples (
