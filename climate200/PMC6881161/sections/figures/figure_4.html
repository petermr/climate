 <caption> Spatial conservation priorities for endemic plants in the face of climate change. Priority rank map for all endemic plants ( n = 2353 species) ( A), all endemic useful plants ( n = 720 species) ( B), useful plants for construction ( n = 374) ( C), culture ( n = 271) ( D), food ( n = 162) ( E), and medicine ( n = 187) ( F). In each map, each grid cell has a value between 0 and 100: Low values close to 0% were removed first (low conservation value and priority), while high values close to 100% were retained until the end (high priority). </caption>
