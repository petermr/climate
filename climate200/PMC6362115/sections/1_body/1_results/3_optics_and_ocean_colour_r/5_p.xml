<p id="Par19">The amount of each constituent relative to each other impacts the ocean colour (i.e. the spectrum of light seen from satellite). The source of CDOM and detritus are modelled to increase/decrease with higher/lower productivity. Over the course of the 21st century, the change in the relative roles of CDOM and detritus on absorption usually have the same sign as for Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, there are many regions where there are opposite responses or the relative change to each other are inconsistent in magnitude. This is because processes other than productivity impact the constituents differently. For example, CDOM is bleached by sunlight

 </sup>, and the combined lower production and increased bleaching due to higher stratification decreases the relative importance of CDOM to the absorption of irradiance in many regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Larger phytoplankton cells are modelled to produce relatively more particulate matter than smaller cells, so as the community shifts to smaller cells we find a larger decrease in the importance of particulate detrital matter relative to Chl-a in many locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Chl:C ratios are also altered by such changes in the community structure. Thus, in different regions of the ocean various combinations of relative changes occur depending on the local alterations to stratification, productivity, community structure and photo-acclimation, driving differing effects on reflectance. Here we have specifically examined

 <sub>RS</sub> at 475 nm, but other different effects also occur at other wavebands and it is the combination of responses that leads to the overall changes in ocean colour (Fig.
