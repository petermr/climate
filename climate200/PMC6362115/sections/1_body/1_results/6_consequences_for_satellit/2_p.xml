<p id="Par32">We explore how the model-derived Chl-a and actual model Chl-a differ over the course of the 21st century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a, c</xref>). In general, the trends in the two have the same sign, but in over 13% of the ocean the trend in derived Chl-a is under-estimated relative to the trend in actual Chl-a (e.g. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) and in 15% it is over-estimated. Note that only 28% of the ocean has a statistically significant trend in the model-derived Chl-a. Thus, the changes in the relative importance of the different constituents suggests that the algorithms developed for satellite derived Chl-a for the present day will not necessarily be valid over the course of the 21st century. This reduced ability to capture trends successfully, as well as differences in the variability in the derived product in some locations (see e.g. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>), also leads to the derived Chl-a having an even smaller signal of change and fewer regions showing statistically significant long-term trends than the model actual Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a</xref>).
