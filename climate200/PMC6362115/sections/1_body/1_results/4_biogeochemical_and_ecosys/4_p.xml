<p id="Par24">Our model suggests that detrital matter will show an even slower and less obvious signal than Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>), but that CDOM will have a stronger signal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>) with 36% of the ocean showing a significant trend by 2100. The increased bleaching of CDOM in the more stratified surface waters leads to this stronger signal relative to Chl-a.
