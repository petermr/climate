<p id="Par23">Only a few regions will show an unambiguous climate change signal in Chl-a before 2030 and many regions will not show a signal by 2100 (white areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c</xref>). We can summarize these results by asking: What is the percentage of the ocean area showing a significant trend at different intervals over the 21st century? This analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10b</xref>) suggests that &lt;5% of the ocean has a significant trend in Chl-a by 2030, and only 31% by 2100. The high interannual variability in Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) results in few regions having a sufficiently strong signal for the trend to be detectable (a similar conclusion was found in a previous study

 </sup>). However, does this mean that there are only small changes occurring in the ocean ecosystem and biogeochemistry over the course of the 21st century in this scenario? We consider other optically important constituents of the water.
