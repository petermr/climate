<p id="Par25">Changes in phytoplankton community composition (as determined by Bray–Curtis Dissimilarity, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) have stronger and more significant trends over the course of the century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10e</xref>) than any of the other metrics that we have considered to this point. A total of 50% of the ocean shows a signal of change by 2100, and even by 2040, 21% of the ocean has an unambiguous signal. In this model the community structure is determined by biogeochemical functional groups; in which differences between the groups are set by their nutrient requirements and roles in biogeochemical cycles (see Methods). These different functional groups also have distinct accessory pigments that lead to different absorption

 </sup>. Thus, the unique combination of phytoplankton that coexist (the community) at any point in the ocean has a strong impact on the optics of the ocean
