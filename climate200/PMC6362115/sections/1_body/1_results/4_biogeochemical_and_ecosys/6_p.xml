<p id="Par26">Though these findings are informative about potential changes in the oceans, these are not as useful from the perspective of the properties that ocean colour satellites actually measure. Each of these quantities, i.e. actual Chl-a, CDOM, detritus and community composition, are quantities that can only be measured in situ. A more practical question would be: What is the percentage of the ocean area showing a significant trend in globally observable quantities at different intervals over the 21st century?</p>
