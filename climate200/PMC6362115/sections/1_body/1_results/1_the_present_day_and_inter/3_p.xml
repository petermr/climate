<p id="Par10">We construct a model ocean colour Chl-a product, similar to that provided from an often used ocean colour algorithm
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. This proxy for Chl-a is derived from the model reflectance fields and will be called derived Chl-a. This is a different property to model actual Chl-a which is the sum of the dynamic Chl-a that is explicitly resolved and is thus more equivalent to the Chl-a that would be measured in situ. The derived Chl-a links the model blue/green reflectance ratio to model actual Chl-a in a manner equivalent to the algorithm that is often used in ocean colour products in the real world
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> (see Methods). This blue/green ratio algorithm has co-variations with Chl-a, CDOM and detrital matter intrinsically built into it
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. This product (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) is more appropriate to evaluate against real world satellite-derived Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) as it is a more equivalent property
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup> and it captures the features of the model actual Chl-a well.
