<p id="Par13">The shifts in Chl-a (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) reflect multiple physical and physiological changes. In many regions there is a decrease in Chl-a and productivity due to reduction in macro-nutrient supply. In polar regions a reduction in sea-ice leads to greater productivity as more sunlight reaches the surface ocean. In other mid to high latitude regions a complex combination of stratification-induced reduction of light limitation (impacting both growth rates and photo-acclimation
 <sup>

 </sup>), decreased nutrient supply, and increased growth rates due to warmer temperatures, leads to a mixed pattern of positive and negative responses
 <sup>

 </sup>. In general, Chl-a changes in the same direction as primary production, but subtle differences suggest that alterations in Chl:C ratios also play a role. In the model Chl:C ratios are driven by light, temperature, and nutrient stress

 </sup>, larger phytoplankton that are disadvantaged in lower nutrient conditions decrease in biomass relatively more than smaller phytoplankton (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b</xref>). Smaller phytoplankton and diazotrophs increase their habitat range

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. There is a significant shift in the total and relative abundances of the different phytoplankton types resulting in alterations to the community structure, measured here as a Bray–Curtis Dissimilarity index
