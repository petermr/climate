<p id="Par12">The goal of this paper is not to repeat a detailed discussion of the modelled biogeochemical and ecological responses to climate change, however we briefly summarize the main features here. In the business as usual scenario (similar to the IPCC RCP8.5

 </sup>. Over the course of the 21st century mean global sea surface temperature (SST) increases by 3 °C, there is increased stratification and reduced mixing at the surface. The meridional overturning circulation slows and shallows relative to current day conditions. These changes lead to a reduction in the supply of macronutrients from depth. Sea-ice retreats.
