 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>) is mostly anti-correlated with the Chl-a trends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a</xref>) as already seen in the difference plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, in some regions (e.g. central North Atlantic gyre) other optical constituents become more important and anti-correlation is not as clear (see e.g. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a, b</xref>). In regions of the largest Chl-a trends, the 475 nm (blue) waveband
