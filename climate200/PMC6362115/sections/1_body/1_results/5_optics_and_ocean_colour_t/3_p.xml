<p id="Par29">The strongest signal is in the blue-green range (in our model the two 25 nm wavebands centred at 475 and 500 nm). These wavebands show a clear signal over 50% of the ocean by the end of the century. The strongest signal of trend was found over the wavelengths spanning from 487 to 512 nm, with 63% of the ocean providing a significant signal by 2100. These are the wavebands where there is the least interannual variability in the model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This matches what is found in the OC-CCI product where interannual variability is lowest in the 490 and 510 nm wavebands. These wavebands also lie on the edge of the wave-space between the strong absorption by CDOM in the bluest bands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and where the impact of absorption by water starts to become more significant in the higher wavebands. These bands are likely to be most sensitive to changes in community composition. The low interannual variability together with sensitivity to changes in all water constituents suggest that these wavebands in the real world satellite sensors (490 and 510 nm) might be the first measurements to detect climate change signal in the marine ecosystem.
