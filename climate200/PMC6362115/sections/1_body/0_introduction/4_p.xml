<p id="Par6">Moreover, the satellite ocean colour products of Chl-a and primary production are still proxies (based on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>RS</sub> measurements) of the real quantities (as might be measured in situ). How are other optically important water constituents predicted to alter over the coming century and how do they together alter reflectance and ocean colour, as observed by satellites? Put another way: How does the colour of the ocean change?
