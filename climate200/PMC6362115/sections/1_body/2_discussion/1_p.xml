<p id="Par35">We use a model that includes ocean physics, biogeochemistry and ecosystem components, plus an explicit representation of the water optical properties and radiative transfer to consider the ocean colour signature of climate change. We consider a business-as-usual (similar to IPCC RCP8.5) scenario of greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the 21st Century, which leads to substantial changes to the physics, biogeochemistry and ecology of the ocean
