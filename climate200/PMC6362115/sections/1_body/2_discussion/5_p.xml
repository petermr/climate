 </sup>. We suggest that the choice of bandwidths for future satellite sensors should also include estimates of the strength of trends they will capture. Our work identifies 467–512 nm as promising from this aspect. Current and historic sensors (e.g. SeaWiFS, MODIS, VIIRS, MERIS) have all included wavebands around 490 nm and we suggest that it is imperative to maintain a similar band in future missions for the earliest signatures of marine ecosystem changes. Our results also suggest that including sufficient bands to detect different communities (e.g. hyperspectral) and those that will help separate signals of CDOM (e.g. ultra-violet) will be important for monitoring ecosystem changes (such bands are planned for the PACE mission).
