  <p>Percent ocean area with significant trend. The amount of open ocean area that has statistically significant trend (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) since 1995 with 5-year increments. 
   <bold>a</bold> Satellite-like derived Chl-a is the blue/green reflectance ratio Chl-a product calculated with an OC4-like algorithm, 
   <bold>b</bold> actual Chl-a is the sum of the 8 dynamically changing phytoplankton which contribute to total Chl-a (as might be measured in situ); 
   <bold>c</bold> detritus is the non-living particulate organic pool, 
   <bold>d</bold> CDOM is the coloured dissolved organic matter, 
   <bold>e</bold> dis refers to Bray–Curtis Dissimilarity index, and is a measure of the changes to the phytoplankton community structure; 
   <bold>f</bold> hue refers to the hue angle, 
   <italic>α</italic>, a metric of true colour; 
   <bold>g</bold> the remotely sensed reflectance in the visible spectrum, in 13 wavebands
