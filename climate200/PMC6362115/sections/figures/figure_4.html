 <caption> Change between current day and end of the 21st century. a Difference in model actual Chl-a (mg Chl m −3) between 2085–2100 mean and the current day (1998–2015) mean. b Change to phytoplankton community structure as defined from Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index for community structure averaged over 2085–2100 versus the present day community (1998–2015). 0 indicates no change, 1 indicates a completely new community. Difference in model R RS 2085–2100 mean and the current day (1998–2015) mean for c 475 nm (blue) and d 550 nm (green). In all panels only areas with statistically significant differences between the two periods ( p &lt; 0.05) are shown. In addition, in c and d we only show regions which were ice free for most of the year (i.e. open ocean where R RS was calculated) in the current day. The symbols (+,o) indicate two locations highlighted in Fig.  8 </caption>
