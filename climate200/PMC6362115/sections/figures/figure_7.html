 <caption> Change in contribution of optically important constituents. Change between 2085–2100 and 1998–2015 of a a phy/ a tot; b a cdom/ a tot; c a det/ a tot at 475 nm. Absorption is indicated by a: a tot refers to total absorption, a phy to the phytoplankton component of absorption, a cdom to the dissolved organic matter component, and a det to the detrital particle component. Only regions with statistically significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) between the two sample periods are shown. In addition, we only show regions that were ice free for most of the year </caption>
