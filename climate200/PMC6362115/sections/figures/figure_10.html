 <caption> Percent ocean area with significant trend. The amount of open ocean area that has statistically significant trend ( p &lt; 0.05) since 1995 with 5-year increments. a Satellite-like derived Chl-a is the blue/green reflectance ratio Chl-a product calculated with an OC4-like algorithm, b actual Chl-a is the sum of the 8 dynamically changing phytoplankton which contribute to total Chl-a (as might be measured in situ); c detritus is the non-living particulate organic pool, d CDOM is the coloured dissolved organic matter, e dis refers to Bray–Curtis Dissimilarity index, and is a measure of the changes to the phytoplankton community structure; f hue refers to the hue angle, α, a metric of true colour; g the remotely sensed reflectance in the visible spectrum, in 13 wavebands </caption>
