 <caption> Remotely sensed reflectance. Current day composite (1998–2015) for a model R RS interpolated to 443 nm, b observed R RS at 443 nm, c model R RS interpolated to 555 nm, and d observed R RS at 555 nm. Units are sr −1. Observed fields are from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) project. White areas are regions where model resolution is too coarse to capture the smaller seas or regions of constant ice cover. Statistics of comparison of model and all six observed wavebands are provided in Supplementary Figs.  1, 2 </caption>
