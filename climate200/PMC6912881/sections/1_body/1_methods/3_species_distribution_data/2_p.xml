<p>We conducted extensive field investigations in northern Xinjiang during the summer (May to September) of 2015 and 2016. We investigated the dominant species of the herbaceous and woody layer in each sampling point, which is distributed every 1–2 km along the major roads in this region. The distance from the point to the road is far enough to avoid possible human disturbance. Elevation and geographical coordinates of each sampling point were also recorded. At the same time, we also took 2–4 photographs in each sampling point with a Canon digital camera. Plant species that were difficult to recognize in the field were collected and sent back to the laboratory for further recognition. To ensure the accuracy of the information of plants species, one of the authors who has expertise on plants in this region cross‐referenced all the records and samples of plant species to Flora of China (

 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Overall, we investigated 2,516 sites, collected 273 plant samples and took 8,356 photographs both inside and out of the Junggar Basin. These points were distributed across the entire region and represented all of the major types of ecological communities (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The presence (i.e., 1) and absence (i.e., 0) of each species in each point were identified to construct a database containing 279,276 records for 111 species. For this study, we used the presence and absence data recorded for the four studied species (

 <italic>A. aphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic>). The number and distribution of these records were presented in Table 
 <xref rid="ece35817-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. For each species, all the 2,516 presence and absence records both inside and out of the Junggar Basin were used to calibrate the SDM, but the model projections were made only within the basin.
