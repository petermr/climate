<p>We conducted the modeling process using the “biomod2” package (ver. 3.3‐18; Thuiller, Georges, &amp; Engler, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) in R (ver. 3.5.0; R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). For each species, we used ten modeling algorithms embedded in the biomod2 package: generalized linear models (GLM), boosted regression trees (GBM), generalized additive model (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), artificial neural network (ANN), surface range envelop or BIOCLIM (SRE), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forests (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt). These algorithms were chosen because they have shown good ability to predict current species distribution and have been widely used in ecological modeling (Hamid et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Combining the predictions of individual algorithms to make ensemble prediction provides results that are more robust and also enables the assessment of the uncertainty generated from the modeling procedure.
