<p>The outputs of models were converted into binary maps of presences and absences using a threshold that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity (Fielding &amp; Bell, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>). For the current projection, all the binary maps predicted by the selected models were integrated into a “consensus map” by calculating the percentage of presence of a given species in a cell (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). The consensus map was then converted to a binary distribution map following the approach proposed by IPCC‐AR5 (Mastrandrea et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) to treat the uncertainty and “likelihood” of predictions. Specifically, the grid cells where more than 66% of the models predicted presence of a given species were regarded as the potential distribution range or suitable habitat of this species. Similarly, the consensus map of future projections for a given species under each RCP scenario in each period (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece35817-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3–S6</xref>) was generated from the projections of all selected models based on all GCMs and was converted to binary distribution maps using the same threshold of 66%. In this way, we produced the potential distribution maps for each species under the current and future climates; hence, the changes in potential distribution range could be analyzed. Specifically, the area that was not suitable for a species currently but predicted to be suitable in the future climate scenarios was identified as “habitat gain” and vice versa “habitat loss.”
