<p>Besides climatic variables, topographical variables were also included in our models. First, slope and altitude at a spatial resolution of 30 m were calculated based on the digital elevation model (DEM) generated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center (USGS, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Second, the distances to fresh and salty waterbodies were also used as predictors in the models due to the following reason. Groundwater level is one of the decisive factors for plant growth in this region but the data are difficult to obtain. The conditions of groundwater are closely related to the distance to a waterbody (Aishan, Betz, Halik, Cyffka, &amp; Rouzi, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>); hence, distance to waterbody has been regarded as a important alternative for groundwater level in vegetation mapping. For instance, Levick and Rogers (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) have used distance from river as an environmental predictor when analyzing vegetation dynamics in African savannah, and Kong, Sun, Chen, Yu, and Tian (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) have accurately mapped vegetation patch distribution change in Tarim river basin using distance to waterbody as a predictor. Considering the factors above, we included the distance to waterbody in our models. We computed the distance to fresh and salty waterbodies through the following eikonal equation (Equation (
