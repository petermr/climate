<p>Several environmental variables were strongly correlated with each other. To mitigate the impacts of collinearity of predictors on model performance, we applied a Pearson correlation threshold of |
 <italic>r</italic>| &lt; .70 (Dormann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) to select the variables used to calibrate the models (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece35817-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Specifically, only one variable from any pair of strongly correlated variables (i.e., |
 <italic>r</italic>| ≥ .70) was retained. The decision on which variable to retain was based on literature (Zhang &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Zhang, Liu, Zhang, &amp; Sun, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and our empirical knowledge. Finally, eight environmental variables (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35817-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were used for the SDM calibrations.
