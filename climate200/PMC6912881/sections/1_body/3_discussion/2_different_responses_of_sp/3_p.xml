 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>, the dominant plant species of the Junggar Basin's desert ecosystem, was predicted to lose 39.6%–63.0% of its current suitable habitat in the 2050s and 41.5%–82.8% in the 2070s. Our prediction is consistent with that of Wu, Lu, and Zhou (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) but contrary to Ma, Wei, Li, Luo, and Sun (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Ma et al. used a limited amount of species occurrence data obtained from literature and only one algorithm, which may explain their different results from ours (Buisson, Thuiller, Casajus, Lek, &amp; Grenouillet, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The range contraction of 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> might be closely related to the lack of regeneration under a future warmer climate. Although 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> is drought‐tolerant, studies have found that its seedlings' survival and natural regeneration depends heavily on the soil moisture replenished by the melted snow layer in early spring of the region (Tian, Tashpolat, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The rapid warming trend in this region, especially the rapid temperature rise in spring, may cause the soil to dry out fast, so that seedlings may fail to survive (Huang, Xiang, Li, &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). These findings have been supported by empirical evidence. Huang, Li, and Yuan (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) had observed massive mortality of seedlings and degradation of communities of 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> in the southern edge of the Junggar Basin, and the deficiency of soil water caused by high temperatures in spring had been considered to be one of the major causes.
