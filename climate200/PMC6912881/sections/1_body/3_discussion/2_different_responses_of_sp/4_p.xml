<p>Similar to 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>, the potential habitat loss of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> also increased with an increase in severity of climate change scenario. In the extreme case of RCP8.5 scenario in the 2070s, 100% of habitat loss was predicted, implying that the Junggar Basin would not be suitable for the distribution of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> anymore. We can also infer from the range change maps that the potential distribution of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> will be limited to the mountainous area in the northeastern Junggar Basin where the climate is colder and wetter. The germination process of the seedlings of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> is very similar to that of 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>, depending heavily on the spring temperature and the water supply of melting snow (Chu, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Previous studies on the seed germination of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> have found that seeds of this species germinated better in a cool and wet early spring, while high temperatures restricted the germination (Chu, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that it may experience the same decline in regeneration as 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> in the warmer future. In addition, among the results of variable importance evaluation, MAT was the single most influencing variable on the distribution of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> with an importance score of 0.872. Wang, Wen, Zhang, and Zhang (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) also reported similar results in the predictions of the potential distribution of 
 <italic>Anabasis</italic> species. These findings together indicated that 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> may be very sensitive to the change of temperature.
