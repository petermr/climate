<p>Despite the limitations mentioned above, considering the lack of studies investigating the effects of climate change on plant distribution in the Junggar Basin and other drylands in the world, this study is valuable at the current stage by providing a better understanding of dryland plant species' responses to climate change, as well as a useful reference to dryland conservation and restoration. Further studies are still needed to investigate a wider habitat range and incorporate other important factors like human activities into the estimation of possible changes of dryland plant species distribution and to facilitate the conservation planning and policymaking in drylands under future climate change scenarios.</p>
