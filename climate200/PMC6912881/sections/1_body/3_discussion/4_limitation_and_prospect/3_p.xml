<p>Our investigation range is limited to northern Xinjiang, which is not large enough to cover the present full habitat ranges of the studied species. Therefore, the prediction of our model could potentially be biased by the incomplete bioclimatic niche space sampled (Wolmarans, Robertson, &amp; van Rensburg, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, as the Junggar Basin (or northern Xinjiang) is a region with a relatively clear biogeographic boundary and unique bioclimatic conditions and our sampling points cover the full range of this area, we believe that our prediction provides useful information on the potential distribution of the species within this region (Barve et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>).
