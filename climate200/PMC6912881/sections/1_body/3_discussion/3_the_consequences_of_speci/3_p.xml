<p>In arid regions, shrubs usually play an important role in modifying microclimate, supporting local plant communities, and determining landscape diversity (Segoli, Ungar, Giladi, Arnon, &amp; Shachak, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). For example, they can form the so‐called “fertile islands” under their canopies, increasing water and nutrient content in the soil in these fertile islands, which are primary limiting factors for the structure, production, and dynamics of vegetation in arid ecosystems (Schlesinger, Raikes, Hartley, &amp; Cross, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). However, the development of fertile islands and their effects on soil and other plants may be greatly species‐dependent due to different morphological characteristics and physiological processes among shrub species (Li, Zhao, Zhu, Li, &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Zhang, Zhao, Yang, Zhao, and Wang (
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) even found contrasting effects of

 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> on understory species. Therefore, different distribution changes of dominant shrubs of the Junggar Basin may also influence the dependent organisms and ecosystems that are connected to these shrub species, causing them to relocate, expand, or deteriorate.
