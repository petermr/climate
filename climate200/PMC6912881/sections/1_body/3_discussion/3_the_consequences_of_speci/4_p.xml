 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> is the dominant species of the riparian forests in the Junggar Basin. As a distinct ecotone between rivers and the surrounding dryland, the riparian zone is of tremendous importance in the ecological and hydrological processes of arid regions (Newman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2006</xref> ). Although our prediction implied that the potential distribution of 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> may not change as significantly as other species do in the future, climate change could still have an apparent impact on the hydrology condition of the riparian zone, which is a main driving factor of 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> riparian forests (Keram et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In addition, the degradation of the 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> forest has been reported to cause oasis desertification and biodiversity loss in the Tarim Basin, a desert zone located in the south of the Junggar Basin (Liu, Chen, Chen, Zhang, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Therefore, more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of climate change on 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> distribution through changes in hydrology conditions.
