<p>To fix sand dune and combat desertification, 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>, 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic>, and other shrub species have been widely used in afforestation in the drylands of northwestern China (Yu &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Though some considered 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> a better afforestation species than 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> due to its stronger drought tolerance (Xu, Ji, Jin, &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Yao, Yan, &amp; Yang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), our prediction result showed that the suitable habitat of 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> may contract substantially in the Junggar Basin, while the suitable habitat of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> is likely to expand. The different changes in climate suitability of these two species implies that policymakers may need to reconsider the selection and combination of the plant species to achieve better afforestation results in this region under future climate changes.
