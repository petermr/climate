<p>Drylands cover over 41% of the Earth's land surface (Berdugo, Kefi, Soliveres, &amp; Maestre, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and have been ranked at the forefront of vulnerability to global change (Parry et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Desertification induced by both climate changes and human activities has been seriously threatening dryland vegetation (D'Odorico, Bhattachan, Davis, Ravi, &amp; Runyan, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Dryland plant species play a vital role in maintaining ecological stability and preventing natural disasters like sandstorms, heatwaves, and desertification (Sivakumar &amp; Stefanski, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Yet, dryland plant species are subject to strong climatic control and may be more sensitive to climate change compared with species in other ecosystems (Vale &amp; Brito, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, previous studies on species distribution changes in response to climate change have mainly been focused on ecosystems like temperate forests, boreal forests, and tundra, while the number of studies on drylands is relatively few, and most have been conducted in North American deserts (Lenoir &amp; Svenning, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
