<p>Species distribution model (SDM) is based on the concept of ecological niche and can identify the statistical relationships between species occurrence data and environmental variables (Peterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). SDM has been widely used in the prediction of environmental suitability and potential distribution range for species (Dyderski, Paz, Frelich, &amp; Jagodzinski, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Noce, Collalti, &amp; Santini, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Wang, Liu, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In this study, we used comprehensive field investigation data and an ensemble SDM method to predict the potential distribution (i.e., suitable habitat) of four representative woody plant species in the Junggar Basin under the current climate and future climate scenarios. We aim to answer the following questions: (a) How will the dominant plant species of the Junggar Basin respond to climate change? (b) Do these species respond similarly to future climate change? If not, what are the possible reasons? The species studied are 
 <italic>Haloxylon ammodendron</italic>, 
 <italic>Anabasis aphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Calligonum mongolicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Populus euphratica</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic> is a perennial small tree, and 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic> is a perennial shrub. Both are dominant species in the southern desert area of the Junggar Basin but with different ecological characteristics (Eziz, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In addition, they are two of the most widely used plantation species in afforestation and ecological restoration in northwestern China (Yu &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> is a dominant perennial sub‐shrub species in the Gobi Desert in the northern mountain area of the basin, where the altitude is relatively higher and the climate is colder and wetter than that of the southern desert (Eziz, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic> is the dominant species of the desert riparian forest, which is an important component of arid inland ecosystems (Li, Zhou, Fu, &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).
