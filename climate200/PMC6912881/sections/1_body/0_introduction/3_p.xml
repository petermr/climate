<p>In recent years, climate change coupled with human activities has strongly affected the distribution of plant species in the drylands of northwestern China. On the one hand, vegetation coverage reduction and degradation driven by climate change and overexploitation of water resources have been observed (Wang, Pan, Wang, Shen, &amp; Lu, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). On the other hand, several drought‐resistant woody plant species have been widely planted since 1970s as large‐scale afforestation efforts to combat desertification in the drylands of northwestern China (Yu &amp; Wang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Nevertheless, these efforts are not always successful due to a lack of understanding about the habitat suitability of the planted species and their responses to climatic change. High mortality has been reported in numerous cases of afforestation (Cao, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Therefore, more studies are urgently needed to estimate the future dynamics of vegetation and to provide better guidance for ecological conservation and restoration in the drylands of northwestern China.
