<p>Junggar Basin, located in northwestern China, contains the second largest desert in China. Compared to the other deserts in Central Asia, the desert of Junggar Basin has extremely diverse plant communities and possesses one of the richest floras in the world's temperate deserts (Zhang &amp; Chen, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Junggar Basin has also developed diverse landscapes and habitats, from Gobi Desert foothills to sandy deserts and oases. Plant communities and environments vary widely between different subregions within the Junggar Basin. Several dominant woody plant species make up the majority of the desert vegetation in the basin (Tang, Yan, &amp; Zhang, 
 <xref rid="ece35817-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Identifying the suitable habitats of dominant woody plant species and their responses to climate change in the Junggar Basin would provide a useful case to demonstrate the importance of knowledge on species' suitability in restoration in drylands.
