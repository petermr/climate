<p>All calibrated models for the four species performed well (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35817-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The mean AUC scores of all models ranged from 0.770 (
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>) to 0.943 (
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic>) and the mean TSS scores of all models ranged from 0.434 (
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>) to 0.842 (
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic>), respectively. These results suggest that these modes had strong predictability on the potential distribution of the studied species. Across different modeling algorithms, RF and GBM displayed better performance than did the others.
