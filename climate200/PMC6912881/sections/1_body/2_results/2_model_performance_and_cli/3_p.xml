<p>The most important climate variables influencing species distributions differed significantly across the four species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35817-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For 
 <italic>H. ammodendron</italic>, the most important variables were temperature‐related variables (i.e., MDR, ISO, MAT, MTCM), while precipitation‐related variables had only limited influences. MAT displayed an exceedingly strong influence in the prediction of 
 <italic>A. aphylla</italic> distribution with an importance score of 0.872, while other variables showed only minor influence. MAT and PCQ were key variables for the prediction of 
 <italic>C. mongolicum</italic>. For 
 <italic>P. euphratica</italic>, it seems that climatic variables are of little importance to its potential distribution.
