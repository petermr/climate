Impacts from a changing climate may outstrip the ability of Canadians and their health-sustaining institutions to adapt effectively and could increase poor mental health outcomes, particularly amongst those most marginalized in society. A scoping review of literature published during 2000&#x02013;2017 explored risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities related to climate change and mental health. In this commentary, the authors present a new assessment of evidence from this scoping review and highlight factors that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of a changing climate. Findings from this assessment reveal eleven key factors that influence the capacity to adapt: social capital; sense of community; government assistance; access to resources; community preparedness; intersectoral/transdisciplinary collaboration; vulnerability and adaptation assessments; communication and outreach; mental health literacy; and culturally relevant resources. Attention to these factors by Canadian decision makers can support proactive and effective management of the mental health consequences of climate change.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>mental health</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>extreme weather</kwd><kwd>adaptive capacity</kwd><kwd>marginalized populations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijerph-16-01583"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Canadians are increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including impacts to mental health. The term mental health is encapsulated in the definition of psychosocial health. Psychosocial health refers to psychological and social wellbeing [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The mental health outcomes related to climate change affect the way people think, act, feel, and interact, and they can arise from short-term hazards, such as flooding or hurricanes, or from an understanding of the potential long-term effects of climate change [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mental health effects related to climate change include mental illness. Mental illness refers to conditions that result in moderate to severe mental disorders [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and mental challenges [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as well as positive mental health outcomes [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Recently, a scoping review by Hayes and Poland (2018) identified and synthesized evidence from the global literature on risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities related to climate change and mental health with a specific focus on the Canadian context [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Briefly, a scoping review refers to a type of literature review where researcher map evidence in a particular area of study, synthesize this evidence, and provide a narrative of the evidence, while also identifying gaps in the literature [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Notably missing in the global literature on climate change and mental health is a focus on psychosocial adaptation to a changing climate. This topic area is particularly salient in Canada, given it is warming twice as fast as the global average [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], thus both mitigation and adaptation efforts are urgently needed to protect human and planetary health. In this commentary, the authors present a new assessment of this original scoping review, exploring factors that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of climate change in Canada. While the lessons learned from this commentary can be applied in other countries, this commentary focuses on the Canadian context to provide information required by decision makers facing challenges addressing climate change on mental health now. The objectives of this commentary are two-fold: (1) to identify response interventions and factors at the societal level that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of a changing climate; and (2) to provide lessons learned for climate change adaptation in Canada. Briefly, societal level response interventions herein refer to: response interventions that can be taken by federal, provincial, municipal, or local decision-makers, to support adaptation within Canadian society.</p><p>Before delving into the topic area, it is prudent to define three key terms used throughout this document. First, response interventions refer to any form of formal or community-based care, policies, or programs that support mental health. Second, adaptation in this report refers to any mechanism, practice, or behavior-change that helps people, communities, and institutions cope with the mental health impacts of climate change and thrive, increasing their resilience to future impacts [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Third, adaptive capacity determinants refer to factors at the individual level or societal levels that support or enhance adaptation. At the individual level, adaptive capacity is determined by individual agency, the perceived need to adapt, the willingness to adapt, and the availability of resources to support adaptation [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At the societal level, adaptive capacity determinants include, for example: governance, economics, infrastructure, technology, information and skills, institutions, and equity [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The focus of this article is on societal level adaptive capacity determinants that support mental health in a changing climate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-ijerph-16-01583"><title>2. Methods</title><p>In this commentary, we provide a new assessment of literature from a recent scoping review that explored the risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities related to climate change [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We review the evidence of climate change impacts to mental health and assess information that supports psychosocial adaptation to a changing climate in the Canadian context.</p><p>The original scoping review captured literature from peer-reviewed and grey sources. As research on climate change and mental health is relatively nascent, both peer-reviewed and grey literature were needed to understand the breadth and depth of climate change risks and impacts on mental health. Inclusion criteria for the original scoping review study included all English peer reviewed and grey literature published globally between 2000 and 2017 relating to climate change and mental health. Publications were included if they addressed: how a changing climate affects mental health (e.g., risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities) and/or how climate-related impacts to mental health are managed (e.g., responses and response capacity). Articles were excluded if they only included a passing mention that climate change impacts mental health or a passing mention about responding to the mental health consequences of climate change.</p><p>The original scoping review drew upon the global literature, applying lessons learned to a Canadian context. All types of literature were included in the scoping review search strategy, including: literature reviews, empirical studies, and reports. The original search terms included: &#x0201c;mental health&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;psychosocial&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;climate change&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;impact&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;response&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;resilience&#x0201d;, as well as synonyms and related words. The terms &#x0201c;resilience&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;global warming&#x0201d; were not explicitly included in the formal search terms; however, in the snowball search (highlighted below), the first author searched for literature that used these terms as well as &#x0201c;extreme weather&#x0201d;. The first author established the search strategy and conducted the literature review in consultation with the second author of this commentary. The following databases were used to search for peer reviewed literature: PubMed&#x000a9;, Scopus&#x000a9;, PsycINFO (Proquest)&#x000a9;, Cochrane Review&#x000a9;, and Google Scholar<sup>TM</sup>. The initial search captured 9079 articles. A snowball search identified a further 25 articles. Duplicates were removed and articles not meeting the inclusion criteria were removed after a review of all abstracts. A total of 276 articles met the inclusion criteria.</p><p>The original scoping review protocol was not registered; however, a summary of the literature reviewed for this scoping review&#x02014;including the literature type, study design and location, participants, and outcome measures&#x02014;can be found in the supplementary materials of the publication by Hayes and Poland (2018) [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The analyses performed by Hayes and Poland (2018) focused on the use of mental health indicators in climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments in Canada. The new assessment presented in this commentary goes beyond the original study by highlighting factors that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of climate change in order to support effective management of these consequences by Canadian decision-makers.</p><p>Analysis of the literature in this new assessment was informed by descriptive qualitative analysis of emergent themes pertaining to climate change and mental health adaptation. The first author of this paper conducted this analysis; the second and third authors provided their expert judgement on this analysis based on their experience in the field of climate change and health adaptation (see, e.g., [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). As the objective of this commentary was to identify societal level factors that influence adaptation to the mental health consequences of climate change in Canada, the lead author conducted a descriptive qualitative analysis of emergent themes using a generic qualitative research method [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, a general descriptive method does not conform to any specific, established method (e.g., grounded theory) and is theoretically interpretively focused [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This interpretive analysis included a review of the literature for themes that pertain to the aforementioned societal level adaptive capacity determinants, including: governance, economics, infrastructure, technology, information and skills, institutions, and equity [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The first author reviewed the literature and made notes of reoccurring emergent themes pertaining to psychosocial adaptation and adaptive capacity in an Excel spreadsheet, the second and third author reviewed these emergent themes based on their expert judgement. These emergent themes are explored in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-ijerph-16-01583">Section 3.4</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-ijerph-16-01583"><title>3. Results</title><p>The majority of the articles in the original scoping review came from literature reviews (58%), followed by empirical research (42%), and finally by commentaries and grey literature (1%) [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Before delving into a discussion of the analysis from the reassessment of the literature, it is prudent to briefly highlight the key findings from the original scoping review as these findings enhance our understanding of climate change and mental health adaptation. There were three key findings: (1) there are a range of mental health risks and impacts from a changing climate; (2) there are unequal risks and impacts to people based on social and environmental factors; and (3) there are a range of response interventions that support mental wellness in a changing climate. These three core findings from the original scoping review are briefly presented followed by an in-depth discussion of factors that influence adaptation to the mental health consequences of climate change.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-ijerph-16-01583"><title>3.1. Mental Health Risks and Impacts of Climate Change</title><p>The literature reveals that the mental health outcomes related to climate change can include: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, complicated grief and survivor guilt, recovery fatigue, and suicidal ideation from climate-related extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other psychological impacts may include weakened social ties, increased stress levels, substance misuse, aggression, and violence related to resource scarcity caused by hazards such as rising heat levels, rising sea levels, and episodic droughts [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Emotions that affect mental health and can result in mental challenges, such as worry, anxiety, and feelings of impending doom related to the overarching awareness of climate change and the risks it poses to planetary and public wellbeing, are also of concern [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The mental health consequences of climate change may emerge immediately following an exposure to a climate change-related hazard or months to years later [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Further, while there are a host of psychological sequelae from climate-related extreme weather events and gradual climate change, people and communities with access to physical and psychological support can experience post-traumatic growth after an adverse event, which can give rise to feelings of optimism and altruism and foster compassion, generosity, a sense of meaning in a person&#x02019;s life, and support broader community resilience [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Unequal Risks and Impacts</title><p>The literature highlights that underlying the mental health consequences of climate change are issues of environmental justice that occur at the confluence of the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and the Ecological Determinants of Health (EDoH). The SDoH are factors that determine or influence health outcomes and health status, including employment, education, income, housing and working conditions, physical environments, social supports, access to healthcare, culture, gender, and childhood experiences [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Interventions may be specific to addressing mental illness and challenges or enhancing positive mental health outcomes, such as environmental civic action groups that aim to reduce climate change impacts while fostering a sense of community, hope, meaning, and purposeful action [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Importantly, these interventions require actions by a variety of actors from various disciplines and these interventions operate across short- to longer-term time scales [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-ijerph-16-01583"><title>3.4. Exploring Psychosocial Adaptation Opportunities</title><p>As noted above, analysis in this reassessment of the scoping review literature included a qualitative analysis of emergent themes pertaining to climate change and mental health adaptation and expert judgement of climate change and health adaptation indicators. This analysis revealed that the effectiveness of currently available response interventions noted above is limited by an incomplete understanding of factors that can influence the capacity for adaptation by individuals and health decision makers. The key factors, herein referred to as &#x0201c;influencing factors&#x0201d;, that emerged in this reassessment of the literature include: social capital [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], sense of community [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], government assistance [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], access to resources [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], community preparedness [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], intersectoral/transdisciplinary collaboration [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], vulnerability and adaptation assessments [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], communication and outreach [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], mental health literacy [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and culturally relevant resources [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B64-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>The influencing factors identified in this research are discussed below along with examples (where applicable Canadian literature exists) drawn from the mental health response to Canada&#x02019;s most recent, and costliest, disasters: the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta wildfires and the 2013 Southern Alberta flood [<xref rid="B55-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Importantly, these influencing factors appear in no order of prioritization because knowledge of the importance of these factors does not allow for their prioritization and many work in combination to enhance psychosocial adaptation and resilience. Based on our analysis and awareness of climate change and health adaptations, it is our perspective that all of these factors in combination would optimize psychosocial adaptation in a changing climate.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-ijerph-16-01583"><title>4.1. Social Capital</title><p>In the literature on climate change and mental health, one of the most frequently highlighted factors that protects mental health and well-being is social capital. Social capital is inextricably linked with mental health, perhaps because social capital helps to reduce social isolation, loneliness, and feelings of abandonment [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Social capital can be described as: &#x0201c;the potential embedded in social relationships that enables residents to coordinate community action to achieve shared goals, such as adaptation to climate change&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (p. 502). Scholars note that social capital may outweigh economic assistance or assistance from aid groups or governments in post-disaster recovery and it underpins resilience [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. LaLone [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] argued that community disaster planning and response organizations need to consider the role for social capital in supporting and enhancing recovery efforts. Dynes (as cited in [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) suggested that the typical &#x0201c;command and control&#x0201d; style of government-led emergency response tends to overlook the significance and effectiveness of social capital in supporting recovery, and as such supporting and building social capital should figure as a central response strategy for governments responding to communities in distress.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-ijerph-16-01583"><title>4.2. Sense of Community</title><p>A sense of community is nested within the conceptualization and practice of social capital, and, similar to social capital, a sense of community (e.g., the feeling of togetherness and belonging) supports resilience in the face of a changing climate [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A sense of community and social support can play vital roles in psychological and psychosocial well-being, especially after a disaster. The catastrophic nature of disasters often results in displacement, fractured communication, and disconnection from homes and communities [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A key priority after a disaster is to rebuild community networks and to form new social connections [<xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A sense of community often requires strong leadership&#x02014;either formal governmental leadership, or grassroots-led leadership, where leaders establish community trust, inclusivity, and foster empowerment [<xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-ijerph-16-01583"><title>4.3.

Mental illness in Canada is very costly; a recent report by the Canadian Mental Health Association estimated that 500,000 Canadians miss work every week due to mental health issues, costing the Canadian economy approximately $51 billion dollars per year [<xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Government programs can contribute to psychosocial well-being in the face of a changing climate through policy and program implementation or funding. In recent years, government assistance was integral in helping to address the mental health outcomes of climate-related events. The Province of Alberta, for example, responded to the 2013 Southern Alberta floods by allocating $50 million dollars to specifically support the current and future mental health needs of Albertans affected by the flood, along with the creation of the first Chief Mental Health Officer [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These funds were primarily used to deploy mental health practitioners from other cities and provinces to affected areas in Southern Alberta and to hire additional mental health specialists [<xref rid="B54-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Government assistance is an important part of mobilizing mental health care to support psychosocial response in the aftermath of climate-related emergencies. As the timing of mental health outcomes vary and can linger for many years, and because of the increasing frequency of climate-related extreme weather events, mental health needs, including programs and interventions to protect people, are likely to grow.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-ijerph-16-01583"><title>4.4.

Lack of access may stem from economics, geography, poor government planning, lack of trust, and/or poorly trained health professionals who may not recognize mental health symptoms or inappropriately triage patients with mental health needs.</p><p>While Canada has a universal, single-payer health care system, access to mental health care can still be impeded by financial constraints and availability of services depending on where an individual lives [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B68-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

Services covered by universal health care in Canada include in-hospital mental health care and out-patient services from primary care physicians, nurses, and psychiatrists [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

In addition, some remote communities may not have (or may not have enough) mental health care facilities, resources, or practitioners prior to an extreme event. In such cases, mental health care is often introduced in a community post-event for a short period of time, however, long-term mental health care needs are often unmet [<xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-ijerph-16-01583"><title>4.6. Community Preparedness</title><p>In Canada, emergency management planning related to climate change has become an increasing area of concern. For example, Public Safety Canada recently released an environmental management strategy that specifically addresses the need for collaborative emergency planning and response (at all levels of government) related to climate change hazards [<xref rid="B70-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Importantly, many preparedness plans and policies tend to overlook mental health care needs related to climate hazards. However, there are a few notable exceptions, such as the mental health and wellness recovery services guide to support Albertans affected by the 2016 wildfire; the guide targets residents, Alberta Health Services staff, physicians, and emergency responders [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This recovery plan was developed in an intersectoral fashion via consultation with: Indigenous community members, the Federal Department of Indigenous Services, Alberta Health Services Addictions and Mental Health, the municipality of Wood Buffalo, clients, and community members [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This plan targets the needs of Indigenous populations, outlines services that are specific to marginalized community members, highlights services available immediately after a wildfire, and describes the medium to long-term services in place [<xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-01583" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>This commentary provides a reassessment of the scoping review conducted by Hayes and Poland in 2018 and a reflection on Canada&#x02019;s costliest disasters (the 2016 Fort McMurray, Alberta wildfires and the 2013 Southern Alberta). In this commentary, the authors explore a number of factors that influence psychosocial adaption to a changing climate in Canada: social capital, sense of community, government assistance, access to resources, community preparedness, intersectoral/transdisciplinary collaboration, vulnerability and adaptation assessments, communication and outreach, mental health literacy, and culturally relevant resources. Importantly, our analysis is limited to key influencing factors that we deemed most applicable to a Canadian context. Absent from the analysis is a focus on factors that would be, for example, most relevant to low- and middle-income countries. While the analysis is centered on a Canadian context, these findings may be useful to decision makers in other jurisdictions and countries facing similar challenges responding to climate change impacts on mental health.</p><p>Climate change adaptation policies may benefit from knowledge of the mental health risks associated with a changing climate, resources required to reduce these risks, and of key factors that can influence the magnitude and pattern of mental health outcomes. Health authorities can obtain this information through vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and in collaborations with partners to reduce the health consequences of climate-related hazards. Further, this information can be used by health care providers to support individuals and communities to more effectively manage mental health issues associated with climate variability and change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable input.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization K.H., P.B. and K.E.; Formal analysis K.H.; Resources: K.H.; Writing&#x02014;original draft preparation K.H.; and Writing&#x02014;review, and editing: K.H., P.B., and K.E.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-ijerph-16-01583"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>K.-L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chapter 7: Human health</article-title><source>Canada in a Changing Climate: Sector Perspectives on Impacts and Adaptation</source><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>F.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lemmen</surname><given-names>D.S.</given-names></name></person-group><publisher-name>Government of Canada</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Ottawa, ON, Canada</publisher-loc><year>2014</year><fpage>191</fpage><lpage>232</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-ijerph-16-01583"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Poland</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Addressing mental health in a changing climate: Incorporating mental health indicators into climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments</article-title><source>Int.
