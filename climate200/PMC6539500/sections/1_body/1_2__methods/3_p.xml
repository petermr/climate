<p>The original scoping review drew upon the global literature, applying lessons learned to a Canadian context. All types of literature were included in the scoping review search strategy, including: literature reviews, empirical studies, and reports. The original search terms included: “mental health” or “psychosocial” and “climate change”, and “risk” or “impact”, or “adaptation” or “response” or “resilience”, as well as synonyms and related words. The terms “resilience” and “global warming” were not explicitly included in the formal search terms; however, in the snowball search (highlighted below), the first author searched for literature that used these terms as well as “extreme weather”. The first author established the search strategy and conducted the literature review in consultation with the second author of this commentary. The following databases were used to search for peer reviewed literature: PubMed©, Scopus©, PsycINFO (Proquest)©, Cochrane Review©, and Google Scholar
 <sup>TM</sup>. The initial search captured 9079 articles. A snowball search identified a further 25 articles. Duplicates were removed and articles not meeting the inclusion criteria were removed after a review of all abstracts. A total of 276 articles met the inclusion criteria.
