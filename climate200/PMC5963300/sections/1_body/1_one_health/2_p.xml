<p>Similar savings have not yet been assessed but can be expected from food-borne zoonoses like salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. Campylobacteriosis is one of the most important bacterial food-borne illnesses in humans caused, among others, through infection via handling and consumption of poultry meat. It is attributable to more than half of the Swiss winter peak of acute gastroenteritis (Bless
