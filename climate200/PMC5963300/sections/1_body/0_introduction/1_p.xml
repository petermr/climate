<p>The journal 
 <italic>The Lancet</italic> recently published a countdown on health and climate change to track the effects of mitigating climate change on public health (Watts 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It provides an extensive plan on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction of climate change. However, the paper focuses on human public health effects of climate change alone, neglecting the important animal and environmental health. Addressing the effects of climate change and climate variability on health in concert illustrates the difficulty to disentangle them from numerous other phenomena of global change. Climate change is superposed by demographic, social and economic, environmental and landscape changes (Hwang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) which often cannot clearly be separately delineated (de Anda 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Modifications in vector, reservoir and pathogen lifecycles as well as diseases of domestic and wild animals and plants are influenced by multiple complex processes (Semenza and Suk 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This also applies to the disruption of synchrony between interacting species, trophic cascades and alteration or destruction of habitats (Patz and Hahn

 <italic>et al.</italic>
