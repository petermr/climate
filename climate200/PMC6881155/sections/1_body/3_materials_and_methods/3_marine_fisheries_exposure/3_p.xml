<p>The impact of climate mitigation on fisheries (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) was measured for each country as the difference between projected changes in MCP under RCP2.6 and projected changes in MCP under 8.5. Positive values thus indicate that climate mitigation will benefit fisheries (greater gains, lower losses, or loss to gain), and negative values indicate that climate mitigation will affect fisheries (lower gains, greater losses, or gains to losses).
