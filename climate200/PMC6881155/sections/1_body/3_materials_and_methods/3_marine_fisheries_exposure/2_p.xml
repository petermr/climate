<p>We considered relative MCP changes between two 10-year periods, 2001–2010 and 2090–2099, using the DBEM outputs driven by three GCMs (GFDP, IPSL, and MPI). We evaluated marine fisheries exposure by summing MCP across each country’s exclusive economic zones over each period and measured country-level relative changes as the log ratio of total MCP projected in the 2090–2099 period to baseline total MCP of 2001–2010. We repeated this process for each GCM and used the average MCP change as a final relative change per country (i.e., our measure of fisheries exposure).</p>
