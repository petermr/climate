<p>To assess exposure of countries’ marine fisheries sector to climate change, we used projections of a proxy of maximum sustainable yield of the fish stocks, maximum catch potential (MCP), from the dynamic bioclimate envelope model (DBEM) (

 </xref>). Contrary to other available global projections (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>), the DBEM focuses largely on exploited marine fishes and invertebrates, which makes projections directly relevant to vulnerability assessment in relation to seafood production. MCP is dependent on changes in body size, carrying capacity of each spatial cell for fish stocks (dependent on the environmental suitability for their growths as well as primary productivity), and spatial population dynamics as a result of temperature, oxygen, salinity, advection, sea ice, and net primary production. Catches from each fish stock are calculated by applying a fishing mortality needed to achieve maximum sustainable yield. The DBEM thus assumes that the environmental preferences of species can be inferred from their biogeography and that the carrying capacity of the population is dependent on the environmental conditions in relation to the species’ inferred environmental preferences. It also assumes that species’ environmental preferences will not evolve in response to climate change. Last, it does not account for interspecific interactions. A more detailed list of assumptions in DBEM is provided in (
