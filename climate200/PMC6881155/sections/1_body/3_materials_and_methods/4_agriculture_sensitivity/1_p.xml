<p>Sensitivity in the context of agriculture was assessed by combining metrics reflecting the contribution of agriculture to countries’ economy (economic dependency), employment (job dependency), and food security (food dependency). We calculated the percentage of GDP contributed by agricultural revenue based on the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (

 </xref>) were used to measure job dependency on the agricultural sector (sensu International Standard Industrial Classification divisions 1 to 5). Since these data include fishing, we subtracted the number of people employed in fisheries (see the “Fisheries sensitivity” section) to calculate the percentage of the workforce employed by land-based agriculture as a metric of job dependency. Last, we used the share of dietary energy supply derived from plants (2011–2013 average) from FAOSTAT’s Suite of Food Security Indicators (
