<p>The impact of climate mitigation on agriculture (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) was measured for each country as the difference between projected changes in agriculture productivity under RCP2.6 and projected changes in agriculture productivity under 8.5 averaged across all crops (maize, rice, soy, and wheat). Positive values thus indicate that climate mitigation would benefit agriculture (greater gains, lower losses, or loss to gain), and negative values indicate that climate mitigation would affect agriculture (lower gains, greater losses, or gains to losses).
