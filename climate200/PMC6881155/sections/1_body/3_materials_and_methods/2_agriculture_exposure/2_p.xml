 </xref>). First, we calculated each country’s total productivity for each crop averaged over each period and measured country-level relative changes as the log ratio of total productivity projected in the 2090–2099 period to baseline total productivity of 2001–2010. We repeated this process for every pair of crop model–GCM, with and without CO
 <sub>2</sub> fertilization effects, for both RCPs, and assumed present-day distributions of farm management and production area. All models included explicit nitrogen, temperature, and water stresses on each crop, except PEGASUS for which results on rice were not available. Only experiments that were available for both RCP scenarios were included. We then obtained the median yield changes for each crop type and calculated the average yield change across the four crops to create the final relative change per country (i.e., our measure of agriculture exposure). Average yield changes for individual crops are presented in fig. S3 along with six additional crops (cassava, millet, ground nut, sorghum, peas, and managed grass) modeled according to the same process (fig. S4).
