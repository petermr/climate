<p>To assess exposure of countries’ agricultural sector to climate change, we used yield projections from an Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison (ISI-MIP) Project Fast Track experiment dataset of global gridded crop model simulations (

 </xref>). We considered relative yield changes across four major rainfed crop types (maize, rice, soy, and wheat) between two 10-year periods: 2001–2010 and 2090–2099. Outputs from five global 0.5° resolution crop models (EPIC, GEPIC, pDSSAT, IMAGE, and PEGASUS) based on five general circulation models (GCMs; GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5ALR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M) were used. Models assume that soil quality, depth, and hydraulic properties are sufficient for sustained agricultural production. Crop models are described in full detail in (
