<p>Opportunities for cross-sector diversification may be constrained not only by climate change policy (see the “Reducing exposure through climate mitigation” section) but also by poor environmental governance. Any identified potential gains in productivity are under the assumption of good environmental management (i.e., crops and fisheries being sustainably managed). Fish stocks and crops in many tropical countries are currently unsustainably harvested (
