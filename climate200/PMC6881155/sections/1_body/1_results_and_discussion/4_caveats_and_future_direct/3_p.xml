These include how governments will prioritize these sectors in the future, changes in trade policies, shifting dietary preferences, changes in technologies, advances in gene editing techniques increasing crop yields, and changes in arable land and cropping density due to the interactions between arable land extension, production intensification, and soil erosion and degradation eliminating areas for cultivation, among others. Together, these gaps provide a strong motivation for more detailed integration of insights from several disciplines (
