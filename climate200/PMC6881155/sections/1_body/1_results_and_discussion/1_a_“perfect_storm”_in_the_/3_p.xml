<p>The different dimensions of vulnerability generally merge to create a “perfect tropical storm” where the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts on agriculture are also the most vulnerable to climate impacts on their fisheries (ρ = 0.67, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 under RCP8.5 and ρ = 0.68, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 under RCP2.6; 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S2). For agriculture and, to a lesser extent, fisheries, sensitivity is negatively correlated with adaptive capacity (ρ = −0.79, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for agriculture and ρ = −0.12, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.07 for fisheries; fig. S2), indicating that countries that are most dependent on food production sectors generally have the lowest adaptive capacity (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The potential impacts (i.e., the combination of exposure and sensitivity) of climate change on agriculture or fisheries will be exacerbated in the tropics, where most developing countries with lower capacity to respond to and recover from climate change impacts are located. Overall, vulnerability remains consistent across scenarios, with countries most vulnerable under RCP8.5 also ranking high under RCP2.6 for both sectors, and vice versa (ρ = 0.98, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and ρ = 0.96, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for agriculture and fisheries vulnerability, respectively).
