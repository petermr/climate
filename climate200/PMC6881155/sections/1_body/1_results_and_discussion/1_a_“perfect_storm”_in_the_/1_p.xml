<p>Spatial heterogeneity of predicted climate change impacts on agriculture and fisheries, coupled with varying degrees of human sensitivity and adaptive capacity on these sectors, suggest that for multisector countries (i.e., countries engaged in both sectors, as opposed to landlocked countries with no or negligible marine fisheries), climate change may induce situations of “win-win” (i.e., both sectors are favored by climate change), “win-lose” (i.e., losses in one sector and gains in the other), or “lose-lose” i.e., both sectors are negatively affected. Under future climate projections, tropical areas, particularly in Latin America, Central and Southern Africa, and Southeast Asia, would disproportionately face lose-lose situations with exposure to lower agriculture productivity and lower maximum fisheries catch potential by 2100 (
