<p>Although this may appear as a bleak outlook for global climate mitigation, we show that among the 15 countries currently contributing to ~80% of the global greenhouse gas production, most would experience net productivity gains (lower losses or losses to gains) in agriculture (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and fisheries (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13) from moving from RCP8.5 to RCP2.6. These include countries with large per capita emissions such as the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia. Conversely, countries projected to experience mitigation-induced net losses in productivity would do so via lower gains, regardless of the sector considered (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and table S2). These results strongly suggest that committing to reduced emissions can markedly reduce the burden of climate change, in particular on the most vulnerable regions, while benefitting agricultural and fisheries sectors of most of the largest CO
 <sub>2</sub> producers, thus providing additional incentives for advancing the climate mitigation agenda.
