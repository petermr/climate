 <caption> IPCC vulnerability framework (AR4), adapted for our cross-sector analysis. Exposure refers here to the extent to which a food production sector is subject to a driver of change. Sensitivity refers to the strength of reliance, or dependency, on this sector in terms of employment, revenue, and food security. Adaptive capacity refers to the preconditions that enable a country to mobilize resources and adjust its food system in response to climate changeâ€“induced impacts of agriculture and fisheries. Note that IPCC now bridges the AR4 definition of vulnerability with the concept of risk (AR5). </caption>
