 <italic>Cool and Adapt Project</italic> for short. This was developed to integrate the city's local climate change plan and its broader environmental plan. Previously, Fukuoka City Government produced its first local climate change plan â€“ the Fukuoka City Local Climate Change Countermeasures Promotion Plan - in 1994, which was updated in 2001 and again in 2006.

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Green Basic Plan (1999)</xref>, and is due to be updated by 2020. The 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City Urban Planning Masterplan (2014)</xref> also discusses climate issues, albeit largely in relation to mitigation and with adaptation actions similar to those in the New Green Basic Plan.
