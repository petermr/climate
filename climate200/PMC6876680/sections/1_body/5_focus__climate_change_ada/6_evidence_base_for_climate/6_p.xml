<p id="p0185">There is also a concurrent interest in Fukuoka in the provision of 
 <italic>kaiteki kankyou</italic> – a liveable environment – through urban planning and environmental governance. This language was utilised in Fukuoka City's first Environmental Plan (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 1986</xref>), and also in the writings of Fukuoka-based academics working at that time (e.g. 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Asano, 1988</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Mitsuyoshi, 1985</xref>). A group of academics from Kyushu University of Design (now part of Kyushu University) in 1981 published 
 <italic>Design of micro-weather in urban greening</italic>, which assessed how urban greenspace at a neighbourhood- and city-scale could be used to ensure thermal comfort (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Nitta et al., 1981</xref>), tallying with 
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Hebbert's (2014)</xref> observation that Fukuoka was one of the Japanese cities to engage early with ideas of urban climatological planning. Indeed, the

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Fukuoka City, 2009d</xref> consider such ideas of preserving wind corridors, creating a city-wide green network, and targeted strategic greening for cooling (see
