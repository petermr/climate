<p id="p0220">The first difficulty lies in putting the visions laid out in the city's greenspace plan fully into action. Whilst there is very good knowledge stretching over three decades of the urban climate in Fukuoka and of how it may be controlled via greening (e.g. 
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hagishima, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Nitta et al., 1981</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Yoda &amp; Katayama, 1998</xref>), interventions in the built environment are perhaps limited beyond the flagship examples laid out in 
 <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Section 6.4</xref>. For more expansive measures such as the preservation or construction of wind corridors, it is also very difficult if not impossible to remove or alter existing buildings along the seafront (interview with KEEA, April 2018). The data presented in 
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Section 5.2</xref> indicates that Fukuoka's continuing growth is putting pressure on green spaces, with a declining trend in green coverage at the time of the last greenspace planning cycle. Nonetheless, this is recognised by the city, and the inclusion of more green and open spaces within the city's formal greenspace system – as well as city government-led initiatives such as the 
 <italic>Green Curtain Project</italic> and 
 <italic>Flower City Fukuoka</italic> – indicate efforts to re-establish greening as part of adaptation efforts.
