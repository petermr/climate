<p id="p0145">Local governments in Japan generally started to form climate change plans from the mid-1990s onwards, to support national obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. These activities were also supported by the 1993 Basic Environment Law, which integrated wider environmental considerations into previous legislation focusing on anti-pollution measures. The production of climate change plans has been a legal obligation for larger local governments – including Fukuoka City – since 2008 due to the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. From 2018, local governments are obliged to develop plans specific to adaptation under the Climate Change Adaptation Act, and also to nominate a local adaptation centre for data collection and provision.

It is however notable that Fukuoka's first climate change plan came earlier than other large cities in west Japan (in addition to those listed in
