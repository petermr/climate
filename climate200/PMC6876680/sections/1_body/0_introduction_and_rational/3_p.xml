<p id="p0035">Fukuoka is therefore significant for several reasons. Firstly, it can be considered a front-running city within Japan for local climate change policy, and also for actions targeted specifically towards adaptation to environmental change supported by the applied research history outlined above. Second, despite national trends, the population in Fukuoka is growing at the fastest rate of any Japanese city (

Assessing how Fukuoka has integrated climate adaptation-related issues into its local policies despite slow national progress, and clarifying remaining challenges, may hence yield lessons for other expanding Asian subtropical cities facing increasing climate-related risks such as urban heat island effects and flooding. In the wider international context, evaluation of how Fukuoka has managed urban heat in particular can contribute to a knowledge gap identified by the IPCC's Cities and Climate theme around knowledge of the relation between planning and the thermal environment in non-European or North American contexts (
