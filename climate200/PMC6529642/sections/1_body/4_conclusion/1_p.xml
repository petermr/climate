<p>Our goal for this study was to gather objective, quantitative data on how individuals’ viewed the affective characteristics of climate-related imagery in order to create an accessible database of stimuli for use in experimental research on climate imagery. We achieved this goal while also supporting the findings of previous, similar studies on this subject that there are common subjects and emotional aspects that are most salient to people when visualizing climate change. We also found that individuals’ interest in the environment has effects on the way they rate images as being relevant or irrelevant to climate change. Non-expert opinions were prioritized in this study, and it was carried out in such a way that it should generalize to non-expert audiences viewing and using these images in future studies.</p>
