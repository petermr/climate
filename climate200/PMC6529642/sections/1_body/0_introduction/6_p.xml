<p>The Climate Visuals library is intended for use by climate change advocacy organizations, bloggers, and journalists, (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>) and was designed accordingly. For experimental research, however, it is less ideal: only 30 images used in the survey phase of the experiment were rated for affect (i.e., valence), and participants only rated six of those images each (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Although images were rated on emotional valence, the arousal dimension (i.e., excitement or physiological arousal) was not assessed. Therefore, potential differences in image processing related to valence vs. arousal cannot be determined with this existing database. In addition, all images were high relevance images. No low relevance images underwent the same rating procedure. The images used in the survey—or a similar image, when usage rights were not obtained—along with their mean ratings, including affect, are presented in a downloadable appendix on the Climate Visuals website
