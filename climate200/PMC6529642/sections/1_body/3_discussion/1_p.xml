<p>From the image-rating task, relevance to climate change and arousal were significantly positively correlated, as were relevance and valence. Arousal and valence were significantly negatively correlated. Therefore, images that were rated as highly relevant to climate change also tended to be rated as highly arousing and low in valence, while images that were rated high in arousal tended to be rated as low in valence in general. The 64 images that were rated 
 <italic>most</italic> and 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant to climate change were then selected for further correlation analyses.
