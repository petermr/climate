<p>We found from the questionnaires that participants had varying levels of pro-environmental beliefs according to their scores on the NEP Scale, with high scores indicating greater pro-environmental beliefs and interest in the environment and low scores indicating less interest and fewer pro-environmental beliefs. Pro-environmental beliefs were found to be significantly positively correlated with the relevance scores of the 32 
 <italic>most</italic> relevant images and the 32 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant images, but not with arousal scores or valence scores. Higher pro-environmental beliefs were associated with higher relevance scores, among both the images rated 
 <italic>most</italic> relevant to climate change and those rated 
 <italic>least</italic> relevant to climate change.
