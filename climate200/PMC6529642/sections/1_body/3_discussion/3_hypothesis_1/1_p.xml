<p>Our first hypothesis was supported by our findings. The strong positive relationships between relevance and arousal show that generally, the images determined to be most relevant to climate change were also determined to be the most arousing or exciting. The negative relationship between relevance and valence showed that the images most relevant to climate change also tended to be the most negative images, emotionally. Exciting, emotionally negative images being rated as the most relevant to climate change in our study is also in line with previous research which has indicated that non-expert individuals tend to find alarming and upsetting imagery most salient when thinking about climate change and global warming (
