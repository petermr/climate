<p>The image rated most relevant to climate change overall depicted polar bears on small ice floes in the water, though only three of the 32

 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al. (2016)</xref>, it was also determined to be easy to understand as relating to climate change. This is most important to our database—images included are intended to be used in experimental research on climate change, thus images need to be easily recognizable as climate-relevant to participants. We have also chosen not to investigate participants’ feelings of self-efficacy regarding the images as some past research has done, as those results indicate that imagery rated high in self-efficacy, or the ability to enact change against climate change, tend to be rated low in climate-relevance (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Images’ relevance to climate change was prioritized in this study, though others using this database in continued research are encouraged to investigate measures of self-efficacy.
