<p>Meanwhile, many of the images in the

However, images of people are frequently found not to be salient to climate change, as represented in our findings, despite being the most common category of picture attached to news media coverage of climate change (both in print and digitally;

 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>), depictions of people in the top 50% of climate-relevant images are generally in line with the recommendations used to compile the Climate Visuals library: these images are mostly of groups of protesters, photos which show “real people” in situations that are not “staged” (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Corner et al., 2015</xref>). So, while images depicting people were more likely to be rated as irrelevant to climate change in general, those that were rated more relevant to climate change possessed the attributes that current research recommends when portraying climate change.
