<p>The objectiveness of these variables is another strength of our study; by using quantitative ratings of relevance to climate change, arousal, and valence, these images can be definitively measured against each other according to each variable. Past studies have only ranked images based on relevance, though not with numerical value (

 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>), with only subjective descriptions of the images’ emotional qualities. Additionally, these ratings were performed on each image by each participant, as opposed to each participant rating only their own personally-relevant climate imagery on its affect (
