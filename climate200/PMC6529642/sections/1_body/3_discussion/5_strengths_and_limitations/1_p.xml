<p>Of course, there were limitations to our study that may have attributed to some of our findings, or lack thereof. Given that scores on the New Ecological Paradigm Scale have been positively correlated with both age and education (

 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hawcroft and Milfont, 2010</xref>), if only slightly, our student sample may have had an effect on the image rating results. However, student samples have been found to be quite comparable to more representative samples when using the NEP (

In addition, although we report the relationship between environmental disposition and image ratings, future research could specifically assess the relationship between climate change attitudes and ratings for climate images. There are also some limitations regarding the images that we used for this study. Specifically, results from the image-rating task have shown that very few images have been rated as both low-arousal and low-valence. As these images and their ratings are being used in a database, we would prefer to have an equal spread of images with all combinations of affective characteristics so that future users can choose images with qualities that meet their needs. However, this was also a problem encountered by IAPS in its early stages (

In addition, open access images of climate change may be of lesser quality than those of professional photographers that restricted usage rights (although it should be noted that our search was filtered to only include high resolution images). These limitations could potentially be rectified by expanding our sample size, both of participants and of images. Future replication of this experiment using these same images with a wider, more diverse range of participants is necessary.
