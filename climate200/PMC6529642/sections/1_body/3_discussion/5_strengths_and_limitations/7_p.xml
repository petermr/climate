<p>Because of this, our database is accessible online with all images available for download and reuse, and with climate-relevance and affective characteristic ratings shown for each image

 </xref>. These ratings have been completed by a non-expert audience in order to best be used as experimental (and control) stimuli in further research on climate change imagery, with climate-relevance determined based on the image alone. Our rating system ensures that any future studies using these images will have the ability for direct comparison, and eliminates any confounds in comparing the results of two studies due to different stimulus sets used. Understanding the cognitive processes associated with climate change (including those related to processing climate images) is important for understanding people’s climate change relevant behavior. For example, we recently used stimuli from this database to demonstrate that images with high relevance to climate change facilitate reaction times and capture observers’ attention compared to low relevance images and this attentional bias is heightened in individuals with pro-environmental attitudes (
