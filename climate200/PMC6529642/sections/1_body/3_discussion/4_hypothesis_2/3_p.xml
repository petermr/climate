<p>These findings address the lack of consideration for environmental beliefs in previous research done on climate change imagery. For example, some previous studies have recorded participants’ attitudes toward climate change, but have not investigated these attitudes and how participants rated images as salient or self-efficacious regarding climate change (

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">O’Neill et al., 2013</xref>). In both cases, a sample with varied climate attitudes was desired and achieved, yet appears not to have been applied to the image ratings. Our findings that individuals’ environmental beliefs, as measured by the NEP scale, were related to their ratings of the images as being relevant to climate change partially supports our prediction for this study, and also attempts to fill a gap in literature on climate imagery.
