<p>There is also a line of research focusing on how experiencing extreme weather can affect attitudes and pro-environmental concerns—the “experience-perception link” (Lang and Ryder,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) found that experiencing extreme weather events was positively related to environmental risk perception. Similarly, Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reported that people were more likely to make pro-environmental donations after interpreting local temperature increases as evidence for global warming (see also Joireman et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).
