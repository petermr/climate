<p>Studies examining the link between personal experience with climate change and subsequent beliefs and actions are just beginning, but there is some circumstantial evidence for an association. For example, Lang and Ryder (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) used google trends (from 2006 to 2012) and found that search terms related to climate change intensified in the months following tropical cyclones, suggesting that people attributed extreme weather events to global warming. Another study compared student cohorts before vs. after an extreme weather event and found more favorable attitudes toward a climate-protecting politician and higher environmental concerns after the events (Rudman et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Similarly, individuals affected by the UK winter flood in 2013/2014 reported stronger negative emotions, greater perceived vulnerability, increased salience of climate change, and higher risk perception compared to a nationally representative sample (Demski et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). More closely linked to pro-environmental actions, Rochford and Blocker (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) found that people who perceived the flood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1986 as preventable were more likely to get involved in flood-related activism. Results from a national survey across UK showed that first-hand experience of flooding was positively linked to environmental concern and even greater willingness to save energy to mitigate climate change (Spencer et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Importantly, research on the experience-perception link seems to focus on cognitive consequences of experiencing climate change. However, as experiencing natural disasters can cause severe distress (e.g., Goenjian et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; van Willingen, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), we expect that such experiences will also affect emotions. For example, past research has found that U.S. mean temperature anomalies has been positively related to “worry about” climate change (Donner and McDaniels, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, induced emotions have shown to increase pro-environmental policy acceptance (Lu and Schuldt, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), a link mediated by belief in anthropogenic causes natural disasters (Lu and Schuldt, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
