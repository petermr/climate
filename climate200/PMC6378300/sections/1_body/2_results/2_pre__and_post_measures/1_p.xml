<p>As our main analysis, we compared answers before vs. after Irma using paired-samples 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Results showed that after experiencing Irma, participants reported stronger negative emotions when thinking about climate change compared to before [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(121)</sub> = 3.00, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.30]. After Irma, participants were more willing to sacrifice (pay higher prices, pay higher tax, and accept cuts in standards of living) than before Irma [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(121)</sub> = 1.99 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.049, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.17]. However, this effect seems to be driven by the willingness to pay higher taxes to protect the environment after Irma [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(121)</sub> = 2.45, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.016, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.24], while the willingness to pay higher prices was not significant and showed a small effect size (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.066, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.18) and willingness to accept cuts in standards of living was not affected (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.909, 
 <italic>d</italic> &lt; 0.01). Participants were more certain that Irma was caused by global warming after experiencing the hurricane compared to before [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(107)</sub> = 2.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.018, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.23]. There was no evidence for change in personal normative belief before vs. after Irma [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(106)</sub> = 1.23, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.223, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.13]. Although a positive tendency, the change for awareness of consequences did not reach statistical significance [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(121)</sub> = 1.71 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.089, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.17]. Finally, a marginally significant unexpected negative effect of progress vs. the environment was observed [
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>(121)</sub> = −2.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.050, 
 <italic>d</italic> = −0.21], indicating that participants were less willing to prioritize environmental actions over human progress after Irma (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table A1</xref>, for correlations between all pre-and post-measures). Additional analyses found that neither political preference nor income moderated these repeated-measures effects significantly (all 
 <italic>p</italic>'s &gt; 0.05).
