<p id="Par18">At the highest elevations close to the Manú tree line, we expected the extinction of certain species from the regional species pool, but all species currently present in the assemblage were projected to persist. This could be a consequence of the wide elevational ranges of species at these elevations. Consistent with Rapoport’s rule

 </sup>, species in the lowlands tended to have narrow elevational ranges, whereas species at high elevations tended to have wide elevational ranges, covering several elevational levels. This pattern potentially mitigates decreases of FDis at high elevations since highland species are expected to have wide elevational ranges and potentially broad climatic niches, which would make them comparatively robust to future climate change. The Blue-and-yellow Tanager (

 <italic>Patagioenas fasciata</italic>) from 1500–3500 m, which means their current range is wider than the projected temperature shifts of 370 m and 520 m of elevation under RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5, respectively (Supplementary Table
