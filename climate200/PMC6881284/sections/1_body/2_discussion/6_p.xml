<p id="Par19">In current highland assemblages, FDis is low compared to lowland assemblages, which might be a consequence of environmental filtering because only species with certain combinations of traits can persist under harsh environmental conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>
 </sup>. At high elevations, the functional trait space is only sparsely filled and functional redundancy is lower than at lower elevations. Consequently, the increase or decrease in the probability of occurrence of a single species can have a large impact on the FDis of these assemblages. For example, the projected 80% decline in occurrence probability of the Grey-breasted Mountain-toucan (
 <italic>Andigena hypoglauca</italic>) would strongly affect FDis as the toucan fulfils a unique functional role in this assemblage. The highest elevation on our gradient (3500â€‰m) coincides with the current tree line
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>, which might constrain bird movements to higher elevations
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Little functional redundancy and idiosyncratic changes in the species composition of frugivorous bird assemblages may, therefore, lead to unpredictable assemblage dynamics at the tree line of tropical mountains.
