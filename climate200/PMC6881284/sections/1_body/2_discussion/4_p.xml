 </sup>). If these changes in species composition concern species with similar functional traits, this could foster redundancy among species as different species might be able to fulfil similar functional roles. When species with similar functional traits occur at different elevations of the Manú gradient, turnover of species driven by climate change could be an important mechanism in maintaining ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal. Under such a scenario, the immigration of species with similar or new sets of functional traits could compensate for the loss of other species

 </sup>. However, upward movements does not only depend on climate, but also on interactions among birds, such as interspecific competition

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. While knowledge on biotic factors shaping species’ distributions is available for some species, comprehensive information is currently lacking for species-rich tropical systems. In addition, species movements in response to climate change may depend on the availability of food resources

 <sup>

 </sup>. Potential asynchronous species’ responses could force bird species immigrating from the lowlands to higher elevations to find new foraging plants

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>

 </sup>. Therefore, it is not yet fully clear how mid-elevation assemblages of frugivorous birds would re-assemble and to what extent vital seed dispersal functions could be maintained at these elevations in the future.
