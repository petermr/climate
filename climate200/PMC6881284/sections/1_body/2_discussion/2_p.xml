<p id="Par15">Our projections consistently predicted reductions of FDis of frugivore assemblages in the lowlands. This decrease in FDis was found in all scenarios (four dispersal and two RCP scenarios). The consistent decrease in projected FDis in lowland assemblages under future conditions suggests that functionally specialized species (with a set of morphological traits that is different from the rest of the assemblage) might decrease in prevalence in the future, whereas species with more generalized morphologies and functional roles are less likely to be affected by future climate change. Because morphologically specialized species provide complementary functional roles to the assemblage

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. Species that were projected to be lost from future lowland bird assemblages included, for instance, the functionally specialized Razor-billed Curassow (

 <italic>azara</italic>), which were among the species with the largest tarsus and bill lengths. The loss of such functionally specialized species may reduce long-distance seed dispersal that is required to maintain forest connectivity
