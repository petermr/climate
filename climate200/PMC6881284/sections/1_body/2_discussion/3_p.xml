<p id="Par16">In contrast to losses in the lowlands, the models predicted an increase of FDis at the lower mid-elevations (1000â€“2000 m) of the gradient. This suggests that there is a high potential for species immigration at these elevations, in particular at the margins of the functional trait space. A major factor driving this trend is the projected upslope dispersal of lowland species in response to global warming

 </sup>. Upslope dispersal potentially causes the immigration of functionally specialized species (that currently are very rare or absent from higher elevations) to the lower mid-elevations. Examples include the Oilbird (
 <italic>Steatornis caripensis</italic>), which is among the species with the most pointed wings, and the White-throated Toucan (
 <italic>Ramphastos tucanus</italic>), which is among the birds with the largest tarsus and bill lengths. The immigration of such species is likely to cause a pronounced change in FDis between current and projected future assemblages at these elevations, since these species occupy distinct positions in the functional trait space. In addition, FDis can also increase due to an increase in the occurrence probability of species with specialized morphologies that are already present in the current assemblages. Examples include the Razor-billed Curassow (
 <italic>Mitu tuberosum</italic>) and Ivory-billed Aracari (
 <italic>Pteroglossus azara</italic>) that are currently present at the mid-elevations, but were projected to have increasing probabilities of occurrence under projected future climate.
