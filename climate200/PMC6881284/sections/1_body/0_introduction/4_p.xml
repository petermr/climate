  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. FDis is defined as the mean distance of individual species to the centroid of all species in a multidimensional trait space

 </sup> and hence measures the dispersion of species traits within the trait space of the assemblage. To connect this measure of functional diversity with species distribution models, we applied a novel approach by weighting FDis with the SDM-derived probability of occurrence of each species in current and projected future assemblages. This SDM-weighted index measures FDis based on the likelihood that a functional role is realized in current and projected future assemblages. A reduced occurrence probability of species with traits located at the margin of the multi-dimensional trait space will thus lead to a reduction of FDis.
