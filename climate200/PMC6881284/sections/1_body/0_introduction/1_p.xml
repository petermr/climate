 </sup>. Species in tropical ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate change, due to low climatic variability and high niche specialization of species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Climate change is expected to be especially relevant for the biodiversity in tropical mountains because elevational gradients show high species turnover

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup> and steep temperature gradients, whereas latitudinal temperature gradients in the tropics are comparably shallow
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>. In response to changing climates, species are expected to alter their geographical and elevational ranges according to their climatic niche
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. In mountainous areas, species likely shift their distribution upwards in response to increasing temperatures
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. Although the direct and indirect effects of temperature on species’ elevational range limits in the tropics are not yet fully understood
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, upward shifts in tropical mountains have already been observed for a variety of taxa, including insects, vertebrates and plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge on how diversity patterns of entire ecological assemblages might change under climate change on tropical mountains.
