<p id="Par34">For all current and projected future assemblages, according to the four dispersal scenarios (
 <italic>no range change</italic>, 
 <italic>range contraction</italic>, 
 <italic>expansion</italic> and 
 <italic>shift</italic>) under RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 for five GCMs, we calculated functional dispersion as measure of functional diversity to determine potential impacts of climate change on FDis of bird assemblages along the elevational gradient. Functional dispersion (FDis) quantifies the weighted averaged distance of all species to the weighted centroid of an assemblage

 </sup> and has been shown to be a robust measure of functional diversity. Specifically, FDis is largely independent of species richness

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>, and log-transformed FDis and species richness of current bird assemblages were not significantly correlated in our dataset (Pearson 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.53, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We weighted FDis by the probability of occurrence of each species in current and projected future assemblages (derived from SDMs). Weighting FDis with the probability of occurrence in current and future assemblages does not imply that occurrence probabilities are a proxy for species abundances (see ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>
 </sup>), but assumes that the probability that a species occurs in a local assemblage is associated with the likelihood that its functional role is realized in this assemblage. Consequently, species with a lower probability of occurrence in an assemblage will influence FDis less than species which are projected to have a high probability of occurrence in the assemblage. We calculated FDis with the dbFD function in the “FD” package in R

 </sup>, based on the ten log-transformed morphological bird traits (see above). Dissimilarities between species were calculated based on the Euclidean trait distance between species. These dissimilarities were used to project the variability in the ten morphological traits onto ten axes in a Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Ordination analysis, such as PCoA, do not suffer from collinearity among variables (for Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the ten morphological traits, see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). In addition, the PCoA provides the possibility to study species’ differences in trait combinations, rather than in single trait values, which is why we used the PCoA axes and not the raw trait data
