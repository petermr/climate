<p id="Par33">To quantify functional diversity, we used ten morphological traits that are relevant for seed dispersal by frugivorous birds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Traits related to beak morphology influence seed dispersal by imposing direct constraints on the possibility that a bird is able to handle and swallow a fruit

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>. Traits related to flight performance and bipedal locomotion influence which fruits a foraging bird species encounters

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, body mass (g) gives an indication of the energy requirements of a bird and therefore the type of fruit it might prefer

 </sup>. Information on avian body mass was derived from Dunning

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>
 </sup>. All other traits were measured on at least four museum specimens for each of the 232 bird species, mainly following the methodology from Eck

 </sup>. We used the mean trait value for each species. Specifically, the ten traits included bill width, length and height (mm), tail length (mm), tarsus length and tarsus sagittal/lateral width (mm), wing length (mm), Kippâ€™s distance (the distance between the tip of the first secondary and the wing tip, measured on the folded wing, in mm), and body mass (g)
