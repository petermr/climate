<p id="Par22">We additionally downloaded occurrence records from continental South America for each bird species in our dataset from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</ext-link>) which we used to fit species-specific SDMs. The data were subjected to a comprehensive quality check, in which we deleted all entries without coordinates, with coordinates located outside the extent of South America (81.5° W to 34.5° W, 56° S to 12.5° N), and all entries where coordinates and country of origin did not match. This resulted in a total of 16–9,138 occurrence records per species (median = 663). Species with less than 40 occurrence records (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 spp) were considered unsuitable for modelling and excluded from further analysis. In addition, we excluded all migratory species that are only present in the region in a certain season (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 spp). This resulted in a species pool of 232 frugivorous bird species with 46–9,138 occurrence records (median = 668.5) per species. Our dataset included species that are widely distributed across South America (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., the White-eyed Parakeet 
 <italic>Aratinga leucophthalma</italic> with 2308 GBIF occurrence records across South America) as well as narrowly distributed species (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., the Scarlet-hooded Barbet 
 <italic>Eubucco tucinkae</italic> with 86 GBIF occurrence records).
