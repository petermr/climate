<p id="Par28">We compiled current bird assemblages for each elevational level along the Manú elevational gradient using the current elevational range data of birds (see above and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). A species was considered to be present in the assemblage of an elevational level when that elevation fell within the elevational range of a species. We are aware that local bird communities within elevational levels might show some variation in species composition and that not all species may interact at a given locality. The data compilation resulted in a binary presence/absence matrix of the 232 bird species at the seven elevational levels (500–3500 m, at 500 m intervals).
