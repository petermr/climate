 </sup> at a spatial resolution of 2.5 minutes (approx. 4.6 km on the equator). Current climate values from WorldClim are based on a 30-year time period between 1961–1990 (“current”) and the future projected climate values on the 20-year time period between 2061–2080 (“2080”). Future climate projections were downloaded for five general circulation models (GCMs) from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013

 </sup>, using two representative concentration pathways (RCP), RCP 6.0 (assumed global average increase of 2.85 ± 0.62 °C in MAT) and RCP 8.5 (assumed global average increase of 4.02 ± 0.80 °C in MAT). Projected climate anomalies were calculated by subtracting the current mean annual temperature and precipitation rasters from the projected future mean annual temperature and precipitation rasters for each climate model. For the elevational gradient, we extracted the mean annual temperature and precipitation anomaly values from the locations of the seven studied elevational levels (in seven grid cells of 2.5 minutes resolution). Anomalies were added to the mean annual temperature and precipitation values from each respective elevational level to obtain the future projected climate along the Manú elevational gradient.
