<p id="Par13">Related to the third expectation, the models according the RCP emission scenario 8.5 suggested a slight increase in FDis at the highest elevations. This was partly due to a lack of species extinctions, as none of the species were projected to occur only beyond the tree line in future scenarios (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, 3000–3500 m). In addition, many bird species, from across the trait space, were projected to immigrate to high elevations (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). However, projected changes in FDis varied substantially among climate models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>) and emission scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) at high elevations. In line with our hypothesis, these results suggest relatively little changes in FDis at high elevations, although models revealed a large uncertainty in the projections at these elevations.
