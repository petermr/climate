<p id="Par12">In line with the second expectation, we found no or little projected change in FDis at the higher mid-elevation (2500 m), regardless of the dispersal scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At this elevation, species with projected increases in occurrence probabilities had similar relative positions in functional trait space as species with projected decreasing occurrence probabilities, leading to little difference in FDis between current and projected future assemblages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 2500 m). At lower mid-elevations (1000–2000 m), we found an increase in FDis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in contrast to our expectation. At these elevations, occurrence probabilities of species at the margins of the functional trait space (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., larger bodied species) tended to increase, while occurrence probabilities of species in the centre of the trait space were projected to decrease (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>, 1000–2000 m). Due to increasing occurrence probabilities of functionally specialized species, the weight of these species in the calculation of FDis increases, resulting in a projected increase of FDis at lower mid-elevations.
