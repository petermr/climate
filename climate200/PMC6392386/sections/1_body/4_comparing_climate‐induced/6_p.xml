<p>There are instances where climate–woodpecker models agree with observed trends, and future predictions are supported by climate–forest projections of the underlying habitat vegetation composition. However, the mechanisms underlying these observed and predicted trends are nuanced and identifying them will improve model integration. For example, the Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker has short‐term predictions that are in agreement with observed trends (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and long‐term predictions indicate range contractions (Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Matthews et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker has been increasing in abundance at its southern range extent since 1966 (Sauer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), shifting south, expanding east, and increasing in geographic range (Bateman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Hitch &amp; Leberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Zuckerberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0130" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), though this is despite climatic factors (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>; Stephens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). They favor early‐successional forests and are currently increasing because of the reversion of post‐European settlement agricultural land use to forests (Walters, Miller, &amp; Lowther, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The contemporary geographic breeding range is projected to decrease by 2080 and shift north under the highest emissions scenario (A2 model; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); this will result in an overall geographic range reduction of 31% (Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and a breeding range almost entirely in Canada (National Audubon Society, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Further, the predicted decline (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) is in agreement with results from a climate–woodpecker–forest model for the eastern and northeastern regions of the United States (Matthews et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Rodenhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), which represents the southern portion of the breeding range.
