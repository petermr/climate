<p>We found that 7 of 15 species short‐term breeding geographic range predictions under one or both emissions scenarios are not in agreement with observed trends (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The contemporary breeding ranges of the Williamson's Sapsucker, Ladder‐backed Woodpecker, and Red‐headed Woodpecker are contracting, and the Golden‐fronted Woodpecker (
 <italic>Melenerpes aurifrons</italic>), Lewis's Woodpecker, Red‐breasted Sapsucker, and White‐headed Woodpecker (
 <italic>Picoides albolarvatus</italic>) ranges are stable. In addition, the American Three‐toed Woodpecker climatically suitable range is predicted to contract substantially in the short term (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>); however, observed trends from 2005 to 2015 indicate an increasing population (Sauer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The disagreements between short‐term predictions and observed trends highlight the potential incongruencies between future potential climatic niches and realized niches based on climate–woodpecker bioclimatic niche models.
