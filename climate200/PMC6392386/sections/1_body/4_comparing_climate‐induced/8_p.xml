<p>Although these climate–forest bioclimatic niche tree models may suffer from under‐prediction errors (Early &amp; Sax, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), a process‐based model of these forest ecosystems indicates a seral stage shift (Thompson, Foster, Scheller, &amp; Kittredge, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), which will affect Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker habitat suitability. The contemporary early‐successional forests of the northeast United States will change by midcentury; at the southern edge of the Sapsucker's breeding range, a shift toward late‐successional species is expected and possibly accelerated as climate change has a net positive impact on growth (Thompson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In addition, the contemporary Sapsucker population is likely above historical size because of the large‐scale changes in land use post‐European colonization (Walters et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). It is likely the current population size and range extents are not sustainable because of antecedent land use change and forest succession; however, climate change will synergistically interact with successional trajectories.
