<p>The predicted declines of climatically suitable range of the Yellow‐bellied Sapsucker appear to be consistent with shifts in climate‐induced tree species composition and forest successional dynamics. Although short‐term climate–woodpecker predictions agree with observed trends, climate is not underlying this trend. Thus, climate–woodpecker predictions may not fully capture future dynamics. Contemporary range distributions are likely a function of forest vegetation shifts, due to historic land use. Future distributions will likely be a function of vegetation shifts resulting from climate change interactions with forest succession. Capturing the effects of climate and forest successional dynamics in the integrated framework of climate–woodpeckers–forest modeling will help account for more nuanced distribution responses.</p>
