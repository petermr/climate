<p>Using climatic conditions associated with contemporary distributions can under‐predict the areas that are suitably post‐climatic change (Early &amp; Sax, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) because landscape‐scale processes can cause a lag in vegetation (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) or animal (Menéndez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) responses. Processes that create a mismatch between expected and actual vegetation could result in the persistence of suitable habitat patches that mitigate short‐term climate change pressures on some populations (Kellermann &amp; van Riper, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). For example, fire potential and frequency are predicted to increase across most of the United States and more specifically the Rocky Mountains (Liu, Goodrick, &amp; Stanturf, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Rocca et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This is proposed to fundamentally change the western U.S. fire regime to dynamics not observed in the historical and paleoecological record, that is, a novel fire–climate–vegetation relationship is predicted (Westerling, Turner, Smithwick, Romme, &amp; Ryan, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Bioclimatic range projections can track climate change assuming processes occurring under current climatic conditions persist. However, bioclimatic niche models do not fully capture the shifting woodpecker niche constraints resulting from novel climate‐vegetation‐disturbance interactions. It is possible that increases in fire severity and or frequency may be beneficial to some woodpecker species in the western United States (Hutto &amp; Patterson, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) and that climatic changes that do not pose direct physiological constraints on woodpeckers may result in suitable habitat via forest composition and structure changes. Therefore, accounting for vegetation and the ecosystem processes underlying vegetation dynamics is important in the climate–woodpecker–forest integration framework.
