<p>We hypothesize that woodpecker responses derived from climate–woodpecker models are likely not in agreement with observed trends because additional niche characteristics (e.g., forest composition) are responding differently to climate change, and these changes are not represented in the models being used. Therefore, mismatches in observed and future trajectories will continue to arise as actual vegetation cover (i.e., habitat) differs from theoretical because of climate conditions interacting with landscape‐scale processes (e.g., fire, seed dispersal; Hampe &amp; Jump,
