<p>As the niche constraints (e.g., forest composition, structure) associated with woodpeckers respond to climate change (Ganey &amp; Vojta, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Westerling, Hidalgo, Cayan, &amp; Swetnam, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), climate variables may poorly approximate woodpecker species responses compared to measures of ecosystem dynamics, for example, forest net primary productivity (Tingley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) or forest composition. Therefore, ecosystems predicted to be climatically unsuitable (per bioclimatic niche models) but predicted to maintain or increase key habitat species or functions (per process‐based climate–forest models) may still be suitable habitat for woodpeckers because of resource persistence. Accounting for associated niche constraints in a climate–woodpecker–forest modeling framework will produce more informative responses.
