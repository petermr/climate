<p>Spatially, there is an emergent pattern of predictions among woodpeckers relative to their contemporary distributions. The climatically suitable ranges of species with contemporary northern or western distribution centroids (i.e., those associated with conifer/boreal forests) are projected to contract (Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). This is in concordance with other model results of climate‐induced declines in avifauna abundance and species richness in conifer/boreal habitats of North America (Stralberg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and Europe (Virkkala, Heikkinen, Leikola, &amp; Luoto, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0115" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Most avian species with breeding range distributions that are associated with eastern deciduous woodlands/forests and southern mixed pine forest are predicted to be climate stable. This includes projections of the Red‐headed Woodpecker (
 <italic>Melanerpes erythrocephalus</italic>), Red‐bellied Woodpecker (
 <italic>Melanerpes carolinus</italic>), Downy Woodpecker (
 <italic>Picoides pubescens</italic>), and Pileated Woodpecker (
 <italic>Hylatomus pileatus</italic>; Langham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Matthews et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Rodenhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). However, species at the southern edge of their range within this region (e.g., American Three‐toed Woodpecker (
 <italic>Picoides dorsalis</italic>) and Black‐backed Woodpecker (
 <italic>Picoides arcticus</italic>)) may diminish because of the encroachment of hardwoods from lower elevations into their primary habitat (spruce‐fir; Rodenhouse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, coastal and southern regions of the United States are predicted to provide climates amenable to many wintering species (Schuetz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
