<p>In comparison, a trait‐based assessment of climate change vulnerability via assessment of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptability found a mixed response among woodpeckers to those metrics. Most North American woodpecker species are sensitive to climate change. However, all are ranked as low vulnerability because of exposure (“the extent of the species’ environment that will change”) and/or high adaptive capacity (“the species’ ability to avoid the negative impacts of climate change through dispersal and/or micro‐evolutionary change”; Supporting information Table

 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) and climate vulnerability assessments (trait‐based assessment; Foden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) may be explained by the inclusion of measures of sensitivity and adaptability in the trait‐based evaluation. Though a qualitative assessment, the trait‐based vulnerability metric exposure to climate change (the quantified metric in bioclimatic niche models) is further modulated by a species’ sensitivity and adaptability to derive vulnerability. Bioclimatic niche models quantitatively assess the exposure of a species with minimal inclusion of the other measures of climate vulnerability (i.e., sensitivity and adaptability). Hence, a species may be exposed to shifts in climatically suitable habitat but may have adaptability potential via phenotypic plasticity or not be sensitive to the degree of climate change represented in the bioclimatic niche model.
