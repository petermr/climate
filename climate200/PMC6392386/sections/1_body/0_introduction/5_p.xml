<p>We reviewed the current and predicted trends associated with climate change impacts on woodpecker responses to identify ways to integrate woodpecker and forest ecosystem models. In addition, our intent is to provide a collective baseline of woodpecker responses to current and future climate change for integrated modeling efforts to be evaluated against. To identify ways to integrate woodpecker models, we identify inconsistencies between current (observed) and predicted responses, explore the modeling causes, and identify the models pertinent to integration that will address inconsistencies. We acknowledge there are vast syntheses possible when studying the response of woodpeckers to climate change. However, the focus of this review is to seek the information to facilitate identification of the model attributes that can best serve an integrated framework of climate–woodpecker–forest modeling. Having this framework will facilitate including other biodiversity measures (e.g., other species) in future climate modeling efforts.</p>
