<p>In summary, after evaluating the predicted and observed woodpecker trends associated with climate change, we found there are inconsistencies between climate–woodpecker predictions and observed woodpecker responses, highlighting the uncertainty of future woodpecker distribution and population predicted responses. We conclude that implementation of climate smart management strategies aimed at increasing or preserving wildlife species will require modeling efforts to include the coupled response of climate–wildlife–forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The use of an indicator species of climate effects on forest biodiversity and resiliency is an improvement to ecosystem modeling. The general principle of coupled modeling frameworks is not a new proposal with regard to climate change (Root &amp; Schneider, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">1993</xref>). However, to date, we are aware of no model (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) that has managed to fully combine wildlife niche modeling into a climate–forest model; meaning modeling activities have utilized multiple models in tandem with data handoffs rather than have the models interact with feedbacks to processes. Our review suggests that fully integrating climate–woodpecker–forest models will address the limitations of climate–woodpecker models, while providing a biodiversity measure for climate–forest modeling efforts. Selection of the proper models within the framework will improve the resolution of fine‐scale woodpecker population responses to climate change and support multi‐objective management through integration of a habitat evaluation metric.
