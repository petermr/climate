<p>Models used to project future abundances and distributions of North American woodpecker species have largely been developed independently of process‐based models of forest vegetation responses to climate change (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The available bioclimatic niche models that predominate the predictions about woodpeckers (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34876-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) provide potential broad‐scale range distribution trends (Pearson &amp; Dawson, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>); however, they lack the finer scale habitat details (e.g., forest structure, composition, and habitat characteristics) that affect localized woodpecker population responses and may strongly interact with climate change. Habitat use and population persistence in a changing climate are difficult to ascertain without vegetation responses. For example, the inclusion of vegetation indices in distribution forecasts of boreal and mixed conifer forests avifauna is important for improving modeling results (Cumming et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The complexities of climate, vegetation, and disturbance interactions that modulate woodpecker habitat use underscore the need for coupled modeling that accounts for these ecological details (La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
