<p>Laying date advancement and increase in reproductive productivity of Northern Flickers (
 <italic>Colaptes auratus</italic>) were observed along the U.S. Pacific coast (Wiebe &amp; Gerstmar, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The authors showed that the response is spatially explicit; it correlates with increases in local ambient temperatures instead of broad regional climate indices or range‐wide temperature gradients. Moreover, differing climatic conditions is producing similar phenology responses within the same species. Red‐cockaded Woodpeckers (
 <italic>Leuconotopicus borealis</italic>) are laying earlier, and those that do are more productive (Schiegg, Pasinelli, Walters, &amp; Daniels, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The climate factors that correlate to these responses differ between populations; one population is responding to increases in temperature and the other increases in precipitation (Schiegg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Mechanistically, this may be occurring via genetic diversity and age‐based experience, which increases plasticity (Schiegg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Woodpecker phenology may be shifting in response to changing climatic conditions; however, behavioral plasticity may not always mitigate climate vulnerability.
