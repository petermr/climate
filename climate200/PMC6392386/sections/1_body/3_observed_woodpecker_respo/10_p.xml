<p>The described range shifts and behavioral responses likely reflect complex interactions between climate, habitat changes, and anthropogenic influences (La Sorte &amp; Thompson III, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) that will affect future population dynamics. For example, the Red‐bellied Woodpecker's range expansion north between 1966 and 2009 (Bled, Sauer, Pardieck, Doherty, &amp; Royle, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) was attributed to maturing forest, backyard bird feeders, (Jackson and Davis Jr 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Meade, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>), and planted trees in the Great Plains (Shackelford, Brown, &amp; Conner, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Although climate is likely influencing these broad‐scale range changes and expansions, it is difficult to ascribe change to climate, if it can be explained by other spatially explicit variables, for example, habitat patterns (Bled et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Currie and Venne (
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) found that among some passerines, their realized niche temperatures have changed in the last three decades and that represents changes in ambient temperature and not necessarily species movements. That is, species did not maintain more constant thermal niches through time or exhibit strong poleward shifts especially at the higher latitudes; therefore, climate change, more specifically temperature, is not always the major driver of continental species’ range shifts (Currie &amp; Venne, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Moreover, observed lag responses to contemporary climate change are likely to occur in the future resulting in miss‐estimations of range change based on climate condition‐only models (Hovick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; La Sorte &amp; Jetz, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; La Sorte et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Factors other than broad‐scale climate are confounding distribution and habitat use responses. The mechanisms underlying observed shifts are numerous (Currie &amp; Venne, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Hitch &amp; Leberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Hovick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; La Sorte &amp; Thompson III, 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Tingley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34876-bib-0111" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and require further consideration, especially within modeling frameworks, if climate‐induced distribution changes are to be accurately predicted.
