<p>Observed woodpecker responses to climate change (studies, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 14; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were largely statistically based and included a variety of dependent variables to characterize a suite of woodpecker species responses in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons (Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece34876-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). These responses included range shifts (elevation, latitude, longitude), niche tracking, migration timing, community composition, energetic demand, and reproductive timing/performance. A few studies implicitly evaluated climate effects on avian responses via overall range shifts. Among the explicit climate effect models, the explanatory variables included climate variables (temperature, precipitation, and extremes (seasonal and annual minimums and maximums)), their aggregates (e.g., bioclimatic variables), and physiography variables (e.g., snow depth). Some studies included non‐climate explanatory variables such as habitat (land use), home range, population trends, and individual characteristics (body condition, age, breeding experience, inbreeding status, mean clutch size, diet breadth, and territory type; Supporting information Table
