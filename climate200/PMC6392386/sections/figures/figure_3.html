 <caption> The integrated framework of climate–woodpecker–forest modeling (d) resulting from the linking of separate model types (a–c). (a) Climate–forest prediction models include a spectrum of model types: dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) to GAP models to dynamic community process‐based forest landscape models (i.e., dynamic communities, spatial interactions, and ecosystem processes); (b) Climate–woodpecker prediction models include bioclimatic envelope models; (c) Woodpecker–forest models include realized niche models (e.g., occupancy), potential niche models (e.g., habitat suitability), and demographic models </caption>
