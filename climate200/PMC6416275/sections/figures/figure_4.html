 <caption> Examples of coastal flooding with 0.25 m of sea level rise and storms. These examples illustrate that there are locations with significant flood risks for small amounts of sea level rise when storms are considered. The left hand series of panels depicts projected coastal flood extent during average conditions (i.e. daily/background conditions with spring tide), and the right side select storm scenarios: ( a) Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, ( b) Alamitos Bay, Long Beach, and ( c) Foster City. See Fig.  3 for locations. “Disconnected, low-lying flood hazard” designates areas that are below the flood elevation surface but are not hydraulically connected to the flooding due to a flow impediment (e.g. levee), and therefore subject to flooding should the flood barrier fail. See Supplementary Fig.  2 to see the uncertainty range for each of the scenarios. (Figure generated using ArcGIS v. 10.4.2, www.esri.com.
