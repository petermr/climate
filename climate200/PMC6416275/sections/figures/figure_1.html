 <caption> Dynamic water level concept. Example from California for 1 m of sea level rise of the significant water level components that comprise total water levels on a beach during a storm along the coast resulting in potential flooding. The range of values are based on observations and modeling conducted during the development and application of the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) across the region 50, 61, 89 . (VLM = vertical land motion, H = wave height, H br = breaking wave height). </caption>
