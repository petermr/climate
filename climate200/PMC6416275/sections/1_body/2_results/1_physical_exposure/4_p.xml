 <sup>st</sup> century total water level time series including each of the SLR scenarios are integrated into the coastal flooding scenarios across the most populated part of the state, southern California (17 million coastal residents, 71% of total study area) (Supplementary Data, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). By 2100, 1.00–2.00 m of SLR would result in an average projected beach loss of 26–41 m across this portion of the study area (95% confidence range = −11 to 93 m), completely eroding up to 67% of the beaches

 </sup>. Bluff retreat projections by 2100 are 19–30 m for SLR ranging from 1.00–2.00 m (95% confidence range = 13 to 38 m), with an increase in retreat rates of 180% for the 2.00 m SLR scenario as compared to the historical rates in southern California

 </sup>. Lower SLR scenarios result in less but not insignificant erosion: for example, 0.50 m of SLR results in 14 m of beach loss and 11 m of cliff retreat. An additional 17–36 m of beach erosion is predicted during the storm simulations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). These model projections assume existing shoreline infrastructure remains in place.
