  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> and sandy beach evolution
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> at ~5000 cross-shore transects spaced every 100 m along the southern California coast. Coastal cliff retreat is projected using a multi-model ensemble that includes vertically-discretized cross-shore models
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>
 </sup>, as well as empirical and statistical models that scale wave forcing and SLR to time-averaged cliff edge retreat rates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>
 </sup>. At each transect, the ensemble gives preference to models that show less sensitivity to variations in model parameters based on the standard deviation during Monte Carlo simulations, and then weights projection uncertainty proportionally with the difference between individual model results (i.e. how well the ensemble reaches a consensus)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. The CoSMoS-COAST shoreline change model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> combines three process-based models to compute sandy beach change: (1) wave-driven longshore transport
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>, (2) cross-shore transport due to waves
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>
 </sup>, and (3) cross-shore transport due to SLR
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>
 </sup>. Both the cliff and sandy shoreline change models use historical shoreline positions, hindcast nearshore wave conditions (wave height, period, and direction), and an adaptive data assimilation scheme to calibrate a suite of equations and develop relationships between wave forcing parameters and geomorphic change at each model location. To drive both cliff retreat and shoreline model projections, continuous time-series of projected nearshore waves

 <sup>st</sup> century, combined with different sea-level rise rates, are used through the year 2100. This is the same total water level proxy that is used to identify storm events
