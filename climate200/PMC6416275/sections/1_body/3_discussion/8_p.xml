<p id="Par20">The importance of dynamic modeling is further illustrated when considering non-linear feedbacks and non-stationarity of the physical drivers of extreme water levels (e.g., tides, surge, and waves), particularly in shallow estuaries and open coastal settings. For example, in San Francisco Bay over the 20
 <sup>th</sup> Century, the Mean Higher High Water tidal datum rose 26 cm, outpacing mean sea level rise by ~16%

 </sup>. In addition, recent hydrodynamic modeling in San Francisco Bay indicates that measureable tidal amplification occurs on the order of ~5 cm if present-day shorelines are maintained and up to ~30 cm if seawalls are built in the future for 1 m of SLR, whereas dampening of up to ~10 cm could occur by allowing flooding into intertidal regions that would serve as energy-absorbing sinks

 </sup>. At broader scales, observations at over 150 tide gauges across the Pacific Basin show a significant correlation between SLR and tidal extremes
