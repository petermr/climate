<p id="Par27">This distribution scaling result indicates that the mean media visibility per scientific authority is an appropriate group-level indicator. As such, if we use the 162 CCSs not included in the 224CCS group as an alternative comparison group, one that is comprised of scientists who are not nearly as elite as the 224CCS, we still find that the 〈
 <italic>r</italic>〉 values for this alternative group are on par with the average values for 224CCS: The group mean values are 〈
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>〉 = 15.4 (224CCC), 1.04 (224CCS), 1.66 (162CCS); 〈
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>〉 = 18.8 (224CCC), 0.94 (224CCS), 0.47 (162CCS). Thus, by controlling for individual-level variation in scientific authority, we show that, even compared to a less prominent scientific comparison group, the 224CCC still have remarkably high media visibility per scientific authority.
