<p id="Par25">FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> shows the total number of media articles (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>), the total number of WOS publications (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>), and the total number of citations (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>). Shown together, this representation highlights the relatively small intersection between the two groups. Despite CCCs holding advantage in gross media visibility, just a few CCCs are on par with the scientific achievement of career experts. Moreover, the scatter plot indicates that CCCs are more likely to have larger 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> values than their CCS counterparts within the same 
 <italic>P</italic> range. Thus, despite the selection criteria that explicitly gives CCSs the advantage in the scientific domain, the discrepancy between the two groups is manifestly prominent.
