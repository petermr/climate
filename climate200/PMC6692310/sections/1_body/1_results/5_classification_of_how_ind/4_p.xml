 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> provides insight into this phenomena by showing the two most common configurations for the subset of articles featuring both CCCs and CCSs. Our results show that the most common motif among articles sourcing CCCs and CCSs are those that are also balanced by sourcing type, with the exception of the WSJ, which instead tends to include CCC contributions juxtaposed by CCS mentions. Among the sources that balance according to sourcing type, the Guardian, NYT, and LAT most commonly mention individuals from each group, whereas WP and FOX tend to incorporate individual contributions from each group.
