<p id="Par19">We performed two group-level comparisons, one using all media articles and one using a subset of media articles coming from 30 select media sources (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These select-30 media sources account for 11% (11,233 articles) of the total media articles analyzed. Because the select-30 media source set was chosen manually, we also compared article counts per group using media source groups identified by an automatic clustering algorithm, which yields consistent results (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).
