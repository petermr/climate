<p id="Par34">To illustrate this latter point, we applied the Louvain modularity maximizing algorithm

 </sup> to cluster the co-visibility matrix into communities of individuals. To be specific, we applied this unsupervised algorithm to identify groups of individuals who are more connected to other individuals within their community than without. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> uses a network visualization layout in which communities are indicated by each network spine, revealing a three-community structure. Moreover, we ordered the individuals (nodes) along each spine according to their network centrality (using the PageRank metric), such that the most prominent individuals within each community are located toward the apex. Inspection of the composition of each community reveals two types: two are mixed and the third is primarily composed of CCCs—a clear example of an archetypal echo chamber.
