 </sup>. One salient human factor that contributes to the public’s susceptibility to information manipulation is cognitive bias. A particularly relevant example is motivated reasoning—the tendency for individuals to bias their judgements according to personal- and group-level values, even when faced with documented facts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. Another class of factors are prominent external influences, owing to elite political cues
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>, ideological biases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, cultural worldviews
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, and even personal weather experiences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Not least among these external factors is the news media
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>, which has a longstanding and dominant role empowering cultural politics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. A third decisive technological factor is the paradigm of new media and the nearly boundless scalability of content distribution across the internet. Even in the case where individuals have complete control in choosing their sources of information, they are nevertheless susceptible to significant disparities in content production in addition to being susceptible to media coverage that is disproportionate to the authority and number of scientists holding the consensus viewpoint. Recent research highlights the ramifications of this problem, finding that the acceptance of CC increases (respectively decreases) with consumption of media content that acknowledges (respectively dismisses) CC realities, other factors being equal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Susceptibility to information manipulation may continue to be a serious problem until society fully adapts to managing the sheer range and volume of new media sources. As such, addressing the opportunities and threats facing CC communication requires an integrated understanding of these human, social, and technological factors.
