<p id="Par58">Analysis of the individual media sources producing CC content also revealed a wide range of production volume. To account for this variation, in what follows we distinguish media visibility within 30 prominent mainstream sources. The members of the select-30 group, ordered according to the total number of CC articles analyzed (in parenthesis), are: the Guardian (1949), New York Times (1188), Washington Post (854), Daily Mail (806), Reuters (473), FOX News (431), Daily Telegraph (406), Washington Times (387), The Sacramento Bee (380), MSNBC (354), Associated Press (298), LA Times (287), Time (287), USA Today (285), Independent (260), The Denver Post (253), Wall Street Journal (244), BBC (243), Miami Herald (243), ABC News (235), CBC (212), Boston Globe (209), CNN (202), CBS News (193), NPR (146), Chicago Tribune (112), Globe and Mail (108), Deutsche Welle (92), NBC News (51), and Seattle Times (45). Importantly, the members of the select-30 were chosen independent of CCCs and CCSs. Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> shows the fraction of each media source’s articles featuring just CCCs, just CCSs, and both groups simultaneously. Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> lists additional information about the type, age, MC unique identifier, and number of unique MC articles collected from each media source.
