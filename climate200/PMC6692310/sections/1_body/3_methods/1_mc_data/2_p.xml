<p id="Par50">We chose to set the upper bound for the MC data collection as October 2016 so to avoid confounding the deluge of CC articles related to US elections and subsequent cabinet and other government administration appointments. One clear limitation of ourÂ MC dataset is that it is biased toward English-language content (98.6% of articles analyzed are classified as English language by MC); however, since the discourse on CC began in the scientific domain, where English is also the de facto communication language, we do not believe this regional bias significantly affects our comparative results within the domain of English-based science and media content.</p>
