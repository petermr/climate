<p id="Par32">We calculated invasion risk at the regional level by using the final ensemble models. For this, we clipped the final ensemble models to different biogeographical regions. For each region, we categorised the ensemble model into four zones i.e., no risk (0.00–0.25), low risk (0.25–0.50), moderate risk (0.50–0.75) and high risk (0.75–1.00) and obtained percentage of high risk invasion by using simple differencing between High Risk zone i.e., (0.75–1.00) and total area of land in Km
 <sup>2</sup>. We further classified the regions at high-risk (&gt;30% of the total area prone to high risk of invasion by the species), moderate risk (&gt;10% to 30% of the total area prone to high risk of invasion) and low risk (&lt;or =10% of the total area prone to high risk of invasion).
