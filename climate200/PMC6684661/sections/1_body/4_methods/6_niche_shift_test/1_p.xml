<p id="Par33">In the present study, we analysed the niche shifts between native region (Europe) and each of the introduced regions (Asia, Africa, Australia, Northern America, Oceania and Southern America) separately. We adopted the modified principal component analysis (PCA-env) approach implemented in the 
 <italic>Ecospat</italic> package version 2.1.1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>
 </sup>. First, based on the observed occurrences of the species, the environmental space of the selected environmental variables was transformed into a two-dimensional space defined by the first and second principal components
 <sup>

 </sup>. The two-dimensional space was then divided into 100 × 100 grid cells bounded by the minimum and maximum PCA values in the background data. Then by applying the kernel density function, we converted the occurrence records of both the ranges into smoothed densities or occurrences. This method was preferred because of its robustness and the kernel density metric used in the method allows for the unbiased comparisons of occurrence densities when the environments are not equally available

 </sup>. We also generated the 10000 random background points for the native and each of the introduced continents separately to have an account of the available (background) environments. We performed the niche equivalency and niche similarity test based on the 95% confidence interval to test the null hypothesis of the similar and equivalent niches of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in its native and introduced regions
