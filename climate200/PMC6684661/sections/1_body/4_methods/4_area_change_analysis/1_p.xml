<p id="Par30">We analysed the change in habitat suitability for the two time periods i.e., 2050 (average for 2041–2060) and 2070 (average for 2061–2080) for the four RCPs: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. We categorised the final ensemble model into four categories following Hamid

 </sup> as: Not suitable (0.0–0.25) coded as blue colour, Low suitable (0.25–0.50) coded as white, Moderately suitable (0.50–0.75) coded as light red and Highly suitable (0.75–1.00) coded as red colour. We calculated the percentage of area change between two SDMs (current vs future) by simple differencing using DIVA-GIS software
