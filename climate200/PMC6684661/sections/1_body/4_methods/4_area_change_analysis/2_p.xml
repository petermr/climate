It is a python-based GIS toolkit that compares the distributional changes between two binary SDMs (current and future) and generates an output raster depicting four categories: (i) range expansion (present in the future SDM only), (ii) no occupancy (absent in both SDMs), (iii) no change (present in both) (iv) range contraction (present under current SDM only).
