<p id="Par5">Of the various invasive alien plant species across the world, Ox-eye Daisy, scientifically named as 
 <italic>Leucanthemum vulgare</italic> Lam. (hereafter referred to as 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in the present study) is a serious invasive weed native to Europe and Western Asia (Armenia)

 </sup> (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The species is a perennial herb belonging to family Asteraceae. In its introduced regions, it invades disturbed habitats like grazing pastures, open meadows, roadside areas and forest openings, thereby reducing the native plant species diversity and results in the formation of mono-specific stands
