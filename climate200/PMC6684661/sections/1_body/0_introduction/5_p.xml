<p id="Par6">To date, scientific research on 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> has mainly focused on its biology
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup> and ecological impacts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. To the best of our knowledge, studies on distribution modelling and impacts of climate change on this invasive species are still lacking. Therefore, modelling habitat suitability and testing its climatic niche conservatism under the future scenarios of climate change can provide robust tools for developing risk assessment protocol and long-term management strategies to prevent the introduction as well as to predict its future invasion hotspots

 </sup>. The present study for the first time, using an ensemble modelling approach, has mapped the current and future potential global distribution of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> and tested the niche conservatism of this invasive species between its native and introduced regions.
