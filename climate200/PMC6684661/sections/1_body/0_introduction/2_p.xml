<p id="Par3">Biological invasions have also been studied from a niche conservatism perspective, i.e. the tendency of invasive species to retain similar niche in the native and introduced regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup> and niche shift perspective, i.e. any change in the niche position between the native and introduced regions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>, or both
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. Niche conservatism and shifts can have wide applications for understanding the effects of climate change on biological invasions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Many research studies have reported niche shifts to be rare in the invaded regions of invasive alien species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>; but some recent studies have reported the frequent occurrence of niche shifts among the invasive alien plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The reason behind these contrasting results mostly lie in conceptual differences associated with environmental availability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, as several studies have taken into consideration the nature of environment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>, while others have not
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, a better understanding of the conceptual and methodological framework underlying invasion niche dynamics may enhance our ability in evaluating the true niche shifts
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. More specifically the niche dynamics of invasive species comprises of five categories, with niche unfilling, stability and expansion occuring in analogous environmental conditions and abandonment and pioneering found in non-analogous environments (see Fig.
