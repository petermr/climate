<p id="Par21">The occurrence of niche shift in invasive species between the native and introduced regions provide a valuable tool for the predictions of species distribution and for mechanistic understanding of invasion process

 </sup>. In the present study, visual inspection of the niche dynamic categories based on all the available (both analogous and non-analogous) environments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) revealed that the species shifted its niche in both the analogous (unfilling and expansion) and non-analogous (abandonment and pioneering) environments. This result is important in order to understand the conceptual framework underlying invasion niche dynamics with respect to environmental availability. Till now, most of the studies that have visualized the niche dynamics based on the available climates (both analogous and non-analogous) usually describe it as unfilling and expansion which is not the real case. Instead, it actually reflects a combination of unfilling and abandonment (when occupied in the native range only) and a combination of expansion and pioneering (when occupied in the invaded range only) and should be better distinguished on the basis of nature of the environments under consideration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, the previous studies have resulted in misleading interpretation of potential niche shifts during biological invasions. Although the niche dynamic categories (abandonment and pioneering) unlike niche unfilling and expansion cannot be considered as true shifts in the fundamental niche of a species because they don’t result from the action of ecological processes and simply reflect the lack of opportunity in one of the regions lacking the particular type of climate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, evaluation of true niche shifts (expansion and unfilling) during the invasion process warrants clear comparison with respect to analogous environment only, so as to avoid analytical artefacts or conceptual differences and/or interpretations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup>. Also, till date, no specialized tool or package which can plot the different niche dynamic categories solely based on the analogous (intersecting) climates is available. Therefore, it remains a challenge for the future research studies, to develop such useful tools which can enhance our understandings of niche visualization in terms of plotting functions.
