<p id="Par24">Our results suggest that niche transferability may be a function of region-specific characteristic, although more intensive research efforts are needed to better resolve the association between the responses and the different biogeographical regions. Given the fact that the floral and faunal composition, and the corresponding climate conditions of an invaded landscape may be novel to the invader and heterogenous to a greater extent, it is expected that some species will show variable distributions in an introduced region and perhaps different responses in different parts of that region

 </sup>. In case of multiple invasions by a single species in different regions, we might expect that its biotic interactions and consequent distributions to be different in each region, thereby indicating that the distributions of invasive species show a specific species-by-region interaction effect

 </sup>. Therefore, the future research studies should focus on the idea that niche transferability as a species-specific characteristic depends upon the particular biogeographical regions under consideration. Furthermore, keeping in view the crucial role of niche shift dynamics, it is important to consider the dimension of niche transferability in studies on biological invasions
