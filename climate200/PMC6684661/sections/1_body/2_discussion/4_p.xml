<p id="Par20">The present study revealed Oceania to be a High-Risk region, both currently and under the future climate change scenarios. While, Northern America was at the Moderate Risk under climate change, the remaining regions were categorised as Low Risk both currently and under the climate change scenarios. These different invasion risk rankings assigned to different regions across the world under the current climatic conditions may be attributed to contrasting scenarios encountered during the early stages of invasion

 </sup>. The initial introduction of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in to Oceania and Northern America might have been to highly suitable habitats leading to its fast spread and colonization. While as in the rest of the regions its introduction would have been into unfavourable habitats which halted its establishment and delayed the subsequent invasion phases, leaving little opportunity for the species to invade its entire climatic niche - a phenomenon referred to as colonization-lag non-equilibrium

 </sup>. Another possible explanation may be the difference in the residence times across different regions which play an important role in the invasion process by providing time for the species to be in equilibrium with the environment in the introduced regions
