<p id="Par23">The present study showed that the shift observed in the climatic niches of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in Asia and Southern America is mainly due to niche expansion. Hence, the presence of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in novel (different) environmental conditions in its introduced regions suggest that its niche has not been conserved during the process of invasion, therefore suggesting an enhanced capacity of this species to invade new regions than previously thought
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The plausible explanation for this expansion could be (i) availability of wide range of climates in these introduced regions. For example, Asia covers a broad range of environments, ranging from tropical to temperate climates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup>, that allows the species to occupy diverse environments. (ii) multiple introductions resulting in the enhanced genetic diversity, allowing the species to overcome the physiological limits of the native population and giving them the competitive ability to adopt to a broader range of ecological conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, the niche shift of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> observed in Oceania is a result of niche unfilling, and not niche expansion, implying that the species has still a lot of suitable habitat available for colonization in the future. This result is in agreement with several other studies that reported niche unfilling to be more common in invasive alien plants than niche expansion
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. This process of unfilling represents a condition of imbalance between the species occupied range (i.e. actual distribution) and potential range (i.e. all areas of habitat suitability) and can be interpreted as an indication of the incomplete invasion process
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup>. The possible reasons for the frequent occurrence of niche unfilling in invasive species can be attributed to recent colonization of the invaded regions, wherein the species is yet to reach the stage of equilibrium within the regional environment and hence unable to occupy all the suitable climatic space available in the novel range
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>. It can also arise due to altered biotic interactions, e.g. the lack of mutualistic partners or the presence of efficient predators, parasites, competitors or herbivores in the invaded region
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. It can also be a consequence of limited species dispersal and propagule pressure

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. So as the residence time of an invasive species in the introduced region increases and the dispersal barriers are overcome mainly due to human aided activities, unfilling may convert to stability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, our study also showed a clear separation of the climatic niche for this invasive species between the native and introduced regions in Africa. This can be attributed to the fact that the species has been able to occupy habitats with different climatic conditions between its native and introduced regions in Africa, as reflected by relatively higher values of both the expansion and unfilling niche dynamic categories (TableÂ
