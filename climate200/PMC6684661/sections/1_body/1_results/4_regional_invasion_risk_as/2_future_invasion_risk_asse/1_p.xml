<p id="Par12">The results predicted that the Oceania will remain as a high-risk region for the potential future invasion of the species across all the RCP’s and for both the time periods (2050 and 2070) with the percentage risk ranging from 46% (under RCP 8.5 for 2070) to 62% (under RCP 2.6 for 2070). Northern America is predicted to be at moderate risk with percentage risk ranging from 11% (under RCP 2.6–2070 and RCP 4.5–2050) to 14% (under RCP 8.5 for 2070). The remaining regions: Southern America, Australia, Asia and Africa are all predicted to be at low risk with percentage risk values of 2 to 3%, 2 to 4%, 1 to 2% and 0.01 to 0.04%, respectively (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). In short, Oceania and Northern America remain as the invasion hotspots for this invasive species, both currently and under future scenarios of climate change.
