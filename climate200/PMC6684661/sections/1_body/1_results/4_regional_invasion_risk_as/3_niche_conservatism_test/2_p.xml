<p id="Par14">Based on the classification scheme of Rodder and Engler
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>, the niche overlap between the native and introduced regions of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> was very limited for Africa (Schoener’s D = 0.004), and Southern America (Schoener’s D = 0.188), low for Asia (D = 0.216) and moderate for Oceania (D = 0.417), Australia (D = 0.503) and Northern America (D = 0.518) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, based on the pairwise comparison between the species environmental niche in the native and introduced regions, the equivalency test was significant (p &lt; 0.05) for Northern America, Oceania and Southern America, and non-significant (p &gt; 0.05) for Africa, Asia and Australia, indicating non-equivalency of the climatic niches in the former and equivalency in the latter case (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>
 <bold>)</bold>. Contrary to this, the niche similarity tests suggested that the niches of 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> in Australia, Northern America and Oceania are more similar to the niche of the native region than expected by chance (p &lt; 0.05) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>
 <bold>)</bold>. These results indicated that in these three regions, 
 <italic>Leucanthemum</italic> could occupy most of the areas with similar climatic condition to those found in its native range. In contrast, the climate niches in Africa, Asia and Southern America are no more similar than expected by chance (p &gt; 0.05). This indicates that in these introduced regions the niche occupation of the species does not follow a pattern expected by native niche requirements and has likely undergone significant alterations in its climatic niche during the invasion process.
