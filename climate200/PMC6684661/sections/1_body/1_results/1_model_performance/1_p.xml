<p id="Par8">In the present study, the final ensemble model obtained by the combination of various models had area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.97, true skills statistics (TSS) value of 0.850 and Cohen’s KAPPA (KAPPA) value of 0.845 indicating that the model performed better in predicting the suitable habitat area for the species (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The model predicted that the suitable habitat area for the target species will increase by the years 2050 and 2070 compared to the current period. Interestingly, many areas currently unsuitable will become increasingly suitable, while some currently suitable regions will become unsuitable in the future (Fig.
