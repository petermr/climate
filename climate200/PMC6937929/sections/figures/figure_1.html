 <caption> Projected weekly precipitation by month from the 2020s to the 2080s across an ensemble of 12 climate models. Solid red and dashed red represents historical 90th percentile precipitation from rainy and dry seasons respectively. The upper whisker of the box plot (solid vertical line) extends from the hinge to the highest value that is within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range. Single points are values above 1.5 * IQR </caption>
