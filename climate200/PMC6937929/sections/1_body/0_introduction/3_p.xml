<p id="Par17">In a related previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], we investigated the relationship between extreme precipitation events (defined as 7-day cumulative weekly precipitation exceeding the 90th percentile in the historical record), drinking water turbidity and cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis for an urban surface drinking water system (DWS) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The study found that extreme precipitation led to significantly increased turbidity, and cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis risk and the risk was greater for precipitation following a dry period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. After the previous study period (1997â€“2009) this DWS installed filtration for two of its three surface water sources to increase the protection from both direct and indirect turbidity-causing events. While the previous study provided historical information about the relationships between extreme precipitation and disease, the objective of our current study is to investigate the change in cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis risk due to climate change, primarily change in extreme precipitation, had these filtration systems not been installed.
