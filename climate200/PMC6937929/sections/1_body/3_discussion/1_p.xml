<p id="Par29">Ours is the first study to assess the impact of future precipitation on cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis utilizing projections from a broad range of downscaled global climate models. It provides evidence that these waterborne illnesses can be impacted by climate change. We first evaluated the climate-disease relationship at a municipal water system scale to assess the epidemiologic relationship between precipitation and the risk of waterborne pathogens. Having identified extreme precipitation as the primary influence, we then used downscaled precipitation projections to assess the impact of future climate on disease [
