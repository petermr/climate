<p id="Par34">In addition to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events, the frequency and length of wet and dry spells could also affect the risk of waterborne diseases as we observed in the historical period. We have less confidence in the modeling for the future number of dry to wet cycles per annum due to the design of the downscaling method. This problem is described in detail by Cannon, et al. [
