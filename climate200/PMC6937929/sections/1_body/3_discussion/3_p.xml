These studies suggest variable increases in diarrheal disease arising from temperature change based on large-scale GCMs. For example, one study projects a 22 to 29% increase in risk of diarrhea by 2070–2099 in six study regions of the world (excluding North America) compared to 1961–1990, based on projected changes in temperature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is difficult to generalize these results to other contexts such as our region in western Canada. First, in previous work, future risks of waterborne illness are extrapolated from studies investigating several pathogens at once, some of which are primarily foodborne. Second, those studies encompass large spatial scales, e.g., national or continental, while factors influencing waterborne disease risk likely act at much smaller scales e.g. watersheds or supply areas. Finally, previous work has not accounted for projected changes in the intensity and frequency of future precipitation, a well-known environmental predictor of water borne illness [
