<p id="Par35">The estimation of the future burden of waterborne illness presents considerable challenges. Several factors that may influence how climate change will affect disease risk can be difficult to model due to the lack of data and our limited understanding of future biological (host-agent-environment) interactions. These include changes in drinking water system characteristics (e.g., improvement in water quality and infrastructure), increased adaptation efforts to climate change (e.g., better watershed management, health services) or changes in behavior influencing the risk of disease (e.g., change in the proportion of the population drinking tap water). Additionally, the long-term illness projections (2020–2080) are based upon a relatively short historical period (1997–2009). Our findings need confirmation in other populations using unfiltered surface water systems with longer historical periods. Examining the range of possible outcomes could assist municipalities in prioritizing building resilience to extreme rain events into their water systems.</p>
