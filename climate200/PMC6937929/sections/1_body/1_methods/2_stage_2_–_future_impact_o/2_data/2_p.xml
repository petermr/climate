<p id="Par23">Daily temperature and precipitation data for the Seymour reservoir watershed and modelled future projections were provided by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC). The historical data are derived from daily gridded weather observation data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and are spatially interpolated at a 1/12 degree (~ 6 × 10 km) resolution. We used interpolated data for the historical period so that it would be comparable to the PCIC statistically downscaled future climate simulations at the same resolution.
