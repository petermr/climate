<p>Volenzo (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) provides some evidence on centrality of and linkages between farmersâ€™ risk attitude and the adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies, dairy cattle productivity and CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission. Because price and market risks are a function of institutional arrangements and policy contexts, Volenzo argues that policymakers may utilise risk management instruments in influencing dairy sector producers to mitigate climate change risks. This is on the account that short-term decisions about allocation of assets and livelihood adaptation options can have both long-term negative and positive implications on the environment and the cycle of poverty (Siegel
