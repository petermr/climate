 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides simulated effect of supplementation on milk production and methane emission risks in maize stover (MS) feeding strategies. The results suggest that the use of MS as standalone ration increases methane emission risks by up to 30.9% per kilogram of un-supplemented MS (18.03 to 26.11 Mj [megajourles] kg
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>). The higher marginal increment in CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions, on average, exacerbates radiative forcing than what would be under higher dairy productivity. Addressing the multiple risks faced by the smallholder dairy farmers can positively influence integration and intensification of dairy feeding strategies that use MS to reduce methane emission risks by 30% (Volenzo 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, the lack of and/or suboptimal supplementation in dairy cattle feeding undermines participation of resource-poor farmers in better remunerative livelihoods and confines them into the poverty traps.
