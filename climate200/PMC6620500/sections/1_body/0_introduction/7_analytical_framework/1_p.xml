<p>Unplanned or autonomous adaptation to climate change could be a driver to degradation of land resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, with far-reaching negative impacts on food security, incomes of small-scale farmers and poverty reduction initiatives. According to Jung et al. (2012), development paths and the choices that define adaptation may affect the severity of climate impacts, not only through changes in exposure and sensitivity but also through changes in the capacities of systems to adapt. This includes local-scale disaster risk reduction (DRR) and resource management and broader social dimensions (Haddad
