<p>Modelling and simulation can be used in the assessment of poverty–production risks–maladaptation to climate change nexus. As simulated quantitative models offer a range of scenarios, they can be utilised in an iterative way to develop scenarios that project impacts within a coupled human–environment system (Turner et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The worst-case scenario in the simulation model may be used in disaster planning (Downing &amp; Patwardhan 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). A model on methane emission in ruminants by Mills et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) was used in this study to simulate methane emissions from dairy cattle feeding strategies by resource-constrained farmers.
