<p>Maladaptation occurs when adaptation action or investment taken to avoid or reduce climate change impacts increases vulnerability to other adverse impacts or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups (Adger, Arnell &amp; Tompkins 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Barnett &amp; Oâ€™Neill 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Maladaptation imposes negative externalities on third parties and ecosystems. A good example of maladaptation would be suboptimal milk production levels, hence increased CH
 <sub>4</sub> emissions per litre of milk from use of MS under low or non-existent energy and protein supplementation. The resultant negative externalities because of radiative forcing may have disproportionate impact on the poor by increasing their vulnerability to other external shocks.
