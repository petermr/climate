<p>The main objective in scaling up sustainable agriculture practices is to transform food production from a major GHG emitter to a net neutral and possibly a GHG sink (UNEP 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This can be achieved through socio-economic policies and regulatory instruments (UNEP 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Sustainable development goals (SDGs) commit subscribing nations to targets aimed at achieving sustainable water use, energy use as well as sustainable agricultural practices (UN 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Sustainable adaptation to climate change and climate policies in agriculture presuppose increased farm productivity and income, resilience to shocks and mitigation of GHGs (Asghar et al. 2005; UNEP 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Dairy feed supplementation is a risk management strategy, which in turn influence dairy cattle productivity and CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission risks (Volenzo
