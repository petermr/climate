<p>According to C-CIARN Agriculture (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), adaptation to climate and weather variability risks should not only take advantage of opportunities, but also increase resilience of farmersâ€™ production systems. This implies minimising environmental degradation and/or pollution risks, as well as stabilisation of output and income. In tandem with sustainability paradigm, anticipatory adaptation implies identifying and reducing underlying risk factors associated with development policies, plans and programmes and linking climate change adaptation to DRR in a mutually supportive manner (UNISDR
