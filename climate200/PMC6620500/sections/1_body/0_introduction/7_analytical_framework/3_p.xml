<p>To maintain or improve their livelihoods, farmers have to adapt to changing policy contexts and environment in which they operate (Maredia &amp; Minde 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The challenging task in planning adaptation activities involves finding ways to combine different measures in a meaningful way in order to avoid maladaptation. The most attractive adaptation measures are those that offer benefits in the near future as well as reduce vulnerabilities in the long-term (Mimura et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This increases the need to investigate policies, plans and programmes in terms of risks and opportunities. The role of adaptive capacity, adaptation process and their implication on use of GHG emissions as a sustainability indicator is particularly relevant in this context.
