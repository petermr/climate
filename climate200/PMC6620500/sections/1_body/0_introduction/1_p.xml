<p>Many parts of the world have been experiencing growing urbanisation and change in dietary preferences that favour dairy production. However, a current and projected increase in levels of milk production would not be possible without expanding production and yield of crop agriculture, hence an increase in demand for land. The lack of additional available land except in parts of tropical Latin America prohibits horizontal expansion of existing modes of dairy cattle production. This necessitates search for alternative dairy feed resources (Steinfeld, Wassenaar &amp; Jutzi 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). This is more so because of feed constraints that are imposed by climate change. Expanding dairy production in many parts of the world, as such, has serious implications on climate change risk management.
