<p>The authors have used methane emission levels in the adaptation of dairy feeding strategies as a measure of sustainable development. It is apparent that mitigating GHG emission risks is one of the pillars of sustainable adaptation to climate change in dairy production. In this study, price risks are intricately associated with maladaptation to climate change among resource-poor farmers. While anecdotal evidence points to pollution and/or environmental degradation caused by the use of external inputs in crop agriculture, considerations of GHG emission levels in the use of MS suggest otherwise. Increased levels of energy and protein supplementation mitigate GHG, with positive impacts on environmental and financial sustainability. The counterfactual seems to suggest that any policy on adaptation and povertyâ€“environmental degradation nexus has to be resource specific. From the analysis, it is clear that climate change can be a driver of disaster risks when economic vulnerabilities that reduce access to inputs and resources that mitigate GHGs are prevalent. Tackling the underlying disaster risk drivers, such as cognitive failure, poverty and poor natural resource management, is thus critical to risk reduction.</p>
