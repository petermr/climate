<p>A farmer may perceive a technology as high risk if it requires investing a higher proportion of his or her limited resources (such as cash for subsistence small-scale farming or improving knowledge and management skills of a farmer) or foregoing a practice that is culturally valued (such as well adapted but low external input-dependent local cattle breeds) in the current system (Maredia &amp; Minde 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This could explain about the low to non-existent supplementation of MS in the maize–sugarcane belt of western Kenya (Volenzo 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The low energy supplementation to non-existent supplementation of MS as a risk management strategy not only reduces income but also increases CH
 <sub>4</sub> emission risks per unit production. The low levels of energy (10 ± 1.1%) and protein (6.5 ± 1.5%) supplementation by households is reflected in low milk production levels (3 ± 1.5 L) against potential of 20 L/day for dairy breeds of medium milk production potential in the study area. As shown in
