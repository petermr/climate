<p>Climate change refers to the change in the state of climate whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persist for extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are the main GHGs that contribute to global warming and depletion of ozone layer (Steinfeld et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Emission of GHGs traps heat in the atmosphere, leading to climate forcing or what is referred to as global warming.
