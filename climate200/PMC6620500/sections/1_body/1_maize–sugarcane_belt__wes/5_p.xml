<p>The western Kenya maizeâ€“sugar belt is under increased population pressure (Jaetzold et al. 2005). Diminishing land sizes and seasonality in production of the feeds makes it difficult to bridge protein and energy gaps in dairy cattle feeding (Ongadi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Climate change is expected to widen and compound difficulties in bridging energy and protein gaps. Such scenarios point towards increased vulnerability of dairy farmers to climate change and weather variability risks. Furthermore, high market risks faced by the farmers negatively impact the adoption of technologies that have potential for increased productivity, low net or GHG neutral emission risks as well as poverty alleviation (Volenzo
