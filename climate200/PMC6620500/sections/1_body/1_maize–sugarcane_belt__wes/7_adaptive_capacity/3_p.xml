<p>Reducing farmersâ€™ vulnerability in terms of exposure to risks associated with climate change increases their propensity to engage in more productive economic activities (Siegel

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Moser &amp; Ekstrom 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Differences in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and value system could account for this conclusion. The observation suggests that other interventions, such as advocacy, sustained publicity and education, are necessary ingredients in spurring sustainability in climate change action.
