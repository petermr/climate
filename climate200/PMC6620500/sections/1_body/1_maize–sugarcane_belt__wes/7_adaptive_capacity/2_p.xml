<p>Coping capacity defines the ability of people, organisations and systems to face and manage adverse conditions, emergencies and disasters using available skills and resources (UNISDR 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Coping strategies are short-term responses to a specific shock such as drought, while adaptive strategies entail long-term change in behaviour patterns as a result of shock or stress (Krantz 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The capacity to cope requires continuous awareness, resources and good management both in normal times and during adverse conditions (UNISDR 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Coping capacities may thus contribute to reduction of disaster risks. However, some coping strategies such as the use of MS as dairy cattle feed without supplementation may be ecologically undesirable (Volenzo
