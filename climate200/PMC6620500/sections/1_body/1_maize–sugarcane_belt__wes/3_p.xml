<p>About 40% of dairy cattle in Kenya are found in semi-intensive farming systems. This feature, coupled with information that such production systems have the highest maize densities, indicates a high potential for benefits from maize–livestock integration (Thorne et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In view of the stresses occasioned by climate change and weather variability, maize–dairy integration offers an opportunity to manage production risks in a dairy enterprise. Unlike other fodder production systems, dry MS forage- based systems do not compete for limited food crop production niches (Volenzo
