<p>After removing duplicates, a total of 757 studies (726 articles and 31 grey literature) were retrieved and initially reviewed for their abstracts. A majority (678 articles) were excluded since they were non-human health-related. Four grey literature found from HERDIN did not have executive summaries, and were not retrievable upon request from the authors. A total of 75 passed the abstract/executive summary review (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02624-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Upon full-text review, 16 studies were found to have no mention or analysis about climate factors and findings specifically for the Philippines. Fourteen had no retrievable full-text copies despite requesting from authors. Five were non-research studies. One article was retrieved from references of a published article. Additional three grey literature were shared by consultation participants, and only one passed the full-text review because the other two were about disaster risk reduction. A total of 40 articles and grey literature were found eligible for this review. Only 34 quantitative studies were presented here [
