<p>For communicable respiratory diseases, interesting associations with exposures were found. Acute respiratory infection prevalence was positively associated with wind speed, but insignificantly associated with relative humidity, mean temperature, and accumulated rainfall [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Pneumonia incidence in children less than three years old was negatively associated with sunshine hours with a cumulative 60 day lag (relative risk (RR) of 0.67 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.52â€“0.87)), but not associated with rainy days, relative humidity, and mean temperature with a cumulative 60 day lag [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Both influenza and RSV had no association with the number of rainy days per week [
