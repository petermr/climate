 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-02624" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Only two models forecasted health outcomes (i.e., the CLIMEX model for malaria prevalence and FARM predictor model for dengue incidence). The CLIMEX model projected malaria prevalence up to year 2100 based on eco-physiological suitability for mosquitoes. Similarly, the predictor model purposively predicted dengue outbreaks four weeks in advance based on environmental predictors related to suitability for mosquitoes.
