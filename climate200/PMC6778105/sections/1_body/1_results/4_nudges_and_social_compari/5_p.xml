<p id="Par30">The combined analysis of intervention per type of behaviour (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) suggests an alternative explanation for the low effect sizes reported in energy and transportation, which could be attributed to the dominant use of information-based interventions. Other types of behaviours were also dominated by specific interventions, such as nudges for reduced meat consumption, social comparison for water saving, and psychological engagement, such as goal-setting, for recycling. The direction of causality is unclear, but these features tend to be associated and future research should unravel more precise sources of impact.
