<p id="Par12">In terms of geographical origin, roughly half of all studies were conducted in the US/Canada, and about 30% were conducted in European countries. With respect to the behaviour targeted, most available estimates were related to energy consumption (36%; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 30, 47 estimates), followed by transportation choices (23%; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 20, 29 estimates), water use (23%; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 19, 42 estimates), and recycling (16%; 
 <italic>N</italic> = 13, 23 estimates). There is a very limited number of interventions targeting food waste and demand for livestock products. For some behaviours, such as demand for air travel or renewable energies, no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using behavioural interventions were identified.
