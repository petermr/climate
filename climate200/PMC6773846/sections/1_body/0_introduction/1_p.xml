  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> and combined with patterns of land-use change can result in the contraction or shift in species ranges
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Studies have shown that, under future climate scenarios, the suitable areas for many species would change, reducing or increasing in size or shifting in latitude and elevation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>. There is concern that these changes will increase extinction risk
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup> and affect biotic interactions
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Additional evidence shows that changes in climate are affecting both insect phenology
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup> and plant phenology, in the latter case delaying flowering periods and causing a mismatch with the presence of key migratory pollinators
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. The loss of a single pollinator can disrupt an entire pollination network by affecting patterns of specialization and floral fidelity of other pollinators
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes under current climate change scenarios might place plant-pollinator mutualisms under a complex mix of spatial and temporal threats.
