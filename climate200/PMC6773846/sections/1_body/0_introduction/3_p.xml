<p id="Par4">Plants of the genus 
 <italic>Agave</italic>, subgenus 
 <italic>Agave</italic>, (hereafter referred to simply as “agaves”) have evolved flower traits (paniculate flowering) that reflect convergent adaptation for pollination by bats
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>, in particular their key pollinators, 
 <italic>Leptonycteris spp</italic>. Compared with other pollinators, bats are large-bodied and can carry greater pollen loads across distant populations of agaves
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Previous studies show evidence that long-nosed bats (
 <italic>Leptonycteris</italic> spp.) are the most important pollinators for agaves and have influenced their rapid speciation

 <italic>Leptonycteris</italic>-
 <italic>Agave</italic> interspecific relationship may be an example of coevolution and mutualism
