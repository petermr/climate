<p id="Par6">The relationship between 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> and the primary 
 <italic>Agave</italic> species it pollinates has never been examined from a climate change perspective. The incorporation of data on potential range shifts of this pollinator and the key food resources could well indicate a more dire scenario for the persistence of 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> over time as well as for the agave species it pollinates. We analysed potential effects of climate change on the geographic distribution of agaves and 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> for the years 2050 and 2070, using ensemble climate models and multiple radiative forcing scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Changes in distributions as a result of climate change could reduce the available foraging resources and affect the population viability of the endangered bat as well as the pollination service they provide.
