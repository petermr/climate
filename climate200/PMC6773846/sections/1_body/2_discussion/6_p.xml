<p id="Par16">Our models indicate that for some 
 <italic>Agave</italic> species the overlapping area with 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> completely disappears under future climate scenarios. Suitable areas for 
 <italic>A. parryi</italic> and 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> tend to retreat North, opposite to what the models show for 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>, which tends to retreat South. Studies on the pollination biology of 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> suggest bats are important pollinators for this agave species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. Our models also suggest that the pattern of agave richness dramatically changes in future scenarios, and the areas with two or more 
 <italic>Agave</italic> species overlapping are greatly reduced (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The fewer agave species present in one region reduces the period with available flowers. This might result in foraging stress for the endangered 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> and force them to migrate to other areas earlier. 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> is also dependent upon caves located along the mountain corridor where it migrates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup> so its ability to move will be dependent upon the availability of suitable caves for roosting.
