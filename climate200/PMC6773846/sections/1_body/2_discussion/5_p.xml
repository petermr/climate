 </sup> examined the effects of climate change on several pairs of tightly linked interactions between butterflies and forage plants in Spain. Favourability indices derived from climate variables vary among the species pairs. In some cases, favourability increases or declines similarly for species pairs and in other cases butterfly and plant favourability shift in opposite directions. Local declines in interacting pairs can thus result from similar losses for both species, but also for declines in favourability for only one of the two mutually dependent species. Our situation differs in that 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> can use several different species of agave. The presence of different species of agave along the bat migratory corridor allows for the availability of foraging resources for longer periods of time because each agave species flowers at a particular time frame and agave richness is an important component of the complex

 </sup>. Thus, the bat can compensate on poor productivity or delayed phenology of one species by switching to another. This assumes that the removal or changes in abundance of one or more agave species does not affect the pollination preferences of the bat. Research on a network of bee pollinators and their forage flowers demonstrated that the loss of one pollinator causes shifts in the fidelity of the remaining bees, causing unexpected declines in fitness of some of the plants

 </sup>. The situation with 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> and the agaves is obviously different, however specific preferences of 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> are not known, nor whether the loss of some of its forage plants would impact the batâ€™s preferences for remaining species.
