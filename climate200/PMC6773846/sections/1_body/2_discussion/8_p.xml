<p id="Par18">Two other nectar-feeding bats (
 <italic>L. yerbabuenae</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. mexicana</italic>) occur within the range of 
 <italic>A. palmeri</italic> and 
 <italic>A. parryi</italic>. Nonetheless, 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> would move pollen further distances because its migratory range is the largest of the three nectarivorous bat species, and the reported maximum elevation for this bat is 3 780 m which is much higher than the maximum reported for 
 <italic>L. yerbabuenae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. mexicana</italic> (1 800 m and 2400 m, respectively) meaning that it can pollinate agave species adapted to high elevations. Moving the pollen over long distances increases the opportunities for maintaining higher genetic diversity in the agaves, which expands the resilience potential of these plants to environmental change.

 </sup> suggest that plants receiving pollen dispersed from long distances may survive climate change because of ecological niche shifts, perhaps due to the movement of alleles from individual plants with different local climatic conditions.
