<p id="Par11">We developed models based only on bioclimatic variables, as a first approximation to potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of species. Several reviews on modelling future species distributions recommend that, in addition to climate, other variables should be considered. These variables include dispersal data, genetic adaptation, species behavioural plasticity, and biotic interactions

 </sup>. Generating this information requires years of study and there is an urgent need to guide management actions for minimizing threats to biodiversity, even more so in endangered species complexes like the 
 <italic>L. nivalis-Agave</italic> interaction. Our models are not predictions of future distributions but rather indicate the direction of change in the distribution of suitable environments for the 
 <italic>Agave</italic> species and their pollinating bat 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>. In general, for all 
 <italic>Agave</italic> species, most of the seeds produced fall from the fruit capsules near the parent plant, but others in strong wind may be blown several meters

 </sup>. This suggests that agaves have a limited dispersal potential and incorporating this variable in the models will likely restrict even more the size of areas with suitable environments in future climate scenarios, increasing the risk of disaggregation of the pollination complex
