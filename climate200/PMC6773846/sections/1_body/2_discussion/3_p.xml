 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Both occur in mountainous regions of Mesoamerica and are particularly sensitive to warming climates. 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> in addition is derived from the Antillean clade in the subfamily, where most species have higher thermal tolerances, and thus represents a more recent adaptation for the cooler mountain regions of Mexico where it occurs.
