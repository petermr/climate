<p id="Par17">In the long-term, the consequences of the mismatch in range shifts between 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> and agaves might result in the reduction or disappearance of bat dependent agave populations throughout areas where they currently are present. Wild agaves are important for maintaining soil stability and preventing erosion, and their absence would affect negatively the arid and semi-arid ecosystems where they occur. More research is needed on the reproductive ecology of agave species to better understand the role of 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic> in their pollination, and document which agaves are more dependent on the presence of the bat for their successful pollination and seed production. The loss of key pollinators results in cascading effects at the ecosystem level
