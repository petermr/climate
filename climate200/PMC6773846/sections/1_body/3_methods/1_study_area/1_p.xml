<p id="Par20">Our study considered the entire range of the Mexican long-nosed bat (
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>) from central Mexico to the south-western United States (Top left: 43.520°, −116.754°; Down right: 15.645°, −95.079°). This bat migrates every spring following the blooming events of paniculated agaves

 </sup>. Thus, we selected paniculate agaves occurring within the bat’s range and documented either in the bat’s diet
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> or to be blooming when the bat was present in a particular area

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
