<p id="Par22">We obtained occurrence records from three online biodiversity databases to model the distributions of the nine agave species and the bat: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.gbif.org</ext-link>), the Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO), and the Mammal Networked Information System (MaNIS). We also compiled records from museum and herbarium collections (CIIDIR-IPN, FCB-UANL, UAAAN), previous published research and surveys

 </sup>, and our own agave and bat survey work. We only used records of agaves occurring in the wild. We consulted with experts in agave taxonomy and ecology (Socorro Gonzalez-Elizondo and Martha Gonzalez-Elizondo from Instituto Politécnico Nacional) who verified all occurrence data from the above sources and all data points were cleaned for errors. We verified the bat occurrence data and only retained records that were confirmed to be the species
