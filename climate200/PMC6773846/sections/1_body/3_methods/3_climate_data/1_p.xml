<p id="Par24">For generating the potential future distributions of environmentally suitable areas for the species of interest, we first characterized the current (representative of 1950–2000) climatic niches using 19 bioclimatic variables obtained from WorldClim project
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup> with a resolution of 0.0083°/px (ca. 1 km
 <sup>2</sup>). These variables are derived from temperature and precipitation data and represent annual trends, seasonality and extreme conditions.
