 </sup>. The climate model responses to the various RCPs are similar until mid-century, and then they begin to diverge. The use of RCP 4.5 and 8.5 effectively captures this divergence in response and the uncertainty involved, therefore we selected these RCPs representing the most plausible low-end (RCP 4.5) and the extreme high-end (RCP 8.5) estimates. The increases in global mean temperatures projected for 2100 (relative to 1990) are 1.0–2.6 °C for RCP4.5, and 2.6–4.8 °C for RCP8.5.
