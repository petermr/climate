<p id="Par26">We projected current distributions to 2050 (average for 2041–2060) and 2070 (average for 2061–2080) scenarios according to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The AR5 assessment uses Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to address the uncertainty in climate projections due to future rates of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and levels of stratospheric ozone. RCPs refer to different levels of radiative forcing projected for the year 2100 (2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5 W/m
 <sup>2</sup>). The radiative forcing is defined as the imbalance in long wave and solar radiation caused by changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols relative to preindustrial conditions.
