<p id="Par8">For 
 <italic>A. parryi</italic>, 
 <italic>A. havardiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. gentryi</italic>, the Global Circulation Model (GCM) ensembles for 2050 show greater losses of suitable area for the low-end Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 than for the high-end RCP 8.5. The same trend is seen for 
 <italic>A. asperrima</italic> and for the bat 
 <italic>L. nivalis</italic>, but in both time projections of 2050 and 2070. Overall the tendency in the RCP 8.5 scenario is towards aridity and the occurrences of the five species mentioned in this paragraph tend to have the lowest annual precipitation values under the current conditions. The models thus indicate that less area will be loss under RCP 8.5, which is the extreme high-end scenario (Fig.Â
