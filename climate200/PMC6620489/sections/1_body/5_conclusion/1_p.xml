<p>The purpose of carrying out social work assessments in any interventions, including disaster interventions, is usually to identify levels of need or risk or to form an understanding when making initial contact with a person affected by natural disaster. This study assessed the role performed by social workers in assessing households affected by climate-change-induced disasters in rural areas. The climate-change-induced disasters reduced the abilities of some communities or households to cope with the events and stresses to which they were exposed, which required a social work intervention. The study has also ascertained that a householdâ€™s encounter with a natural disaster is also a social problem that requires a social work intervention. In addition, the findings revealed that the assessment of impacts of natural disasters is important to guide proper social work intervention. Furthermore, by developing and applying integrated (multi-level intervention) approaches that incorporate established interventions, social workers can distinctly improve intervention services for clients and their families (Makhubele
