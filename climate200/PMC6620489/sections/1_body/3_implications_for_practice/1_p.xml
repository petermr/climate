<p>The study envisages providing clarifications on the role of social work in disaster management. This article argues that the role and involvement of social workers in climate-change-induced disasters is necessary (Jones &amp; Truell 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Social workers need to understand the social, cultural, economic, political and historical contexts of the locality in which the disaster occurred in order to intervene appropriately (Gray et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The research will contribute to the problem-solving knowledge of social work in intervening in communities affected by natural disasters. This will be in line with the Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Developmentâ€™s commitment to work towards environmental sustainability in responding to the impacts of natural disasters by conducting research in social work in cooperation with communities (Jones &amp; Truell 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The research output will assist policy-makers, such as national DSD, in planning and assessment for future climate-change-induced disasters.
