<p>A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive design was implemented to describe the role of social work in the assessment of households affected by climate-change-induced disasters (Creswell 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Monnette et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The qualitative design was absolute in providing rich information from participants’ perceptions and experiences (Babbie &amp; Mouton 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The assessment of the role of social work in disaster interventions was carried out at Naphuno subdistrict, a community affected by natural disasters approximately 30 km outside Greater Tzaneen Municipality in Limpopo Province. The researcher’s selection of the community was based on prior knowledge in having been a practising social worker at the Department of Social Development. Furthermore, the researcher had a desire to investigate the role of social work in climate-change-induced disasters, as ultimately, social workers are expected to provide social relief of distress services in disaster interventions. The researcher put together a small sample of five social workers, two social auxiliary workers and 10 households who had been affected by natural disasters. These individuals from the 10 households were assessed by social workers following a disaster and were purposively selected so that comprehensive knowledge on the topic under study could be yielded (Babbie &amp; Mouton
