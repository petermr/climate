<p>Natural disasters are inevitable and occur throughout the world, and many social workers and students should engage in disaster relief processes (Tang &amp; Cheung 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In this article, I argue that the role of social work assessment is essential in disaster management. Social work practice is considered by Compton, Galaway and Cournoyer (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) to be the professional application of social work values, principles and techniques. This is aimed at helping people to obtain social work services, such as counselling and therapy, to improve their social functioning. However, before such social work services can be rendered, a proper assessment is essential. Assessment in social work is described by Coulshed and Orme (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) as an ongoing participatory process that seeks to understand the service user and his or her situation and sets a basis for planning how change or improvement can be achieved. In addition, Coulshed and Orme (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and Compton et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) assert that social work assessment is the basis for planning what needs to be done in order to bring about the required change.
