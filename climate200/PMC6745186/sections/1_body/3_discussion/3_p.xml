<p>As a consequence of the fact that species hold limited potential to adapt to the warmer and drier climatic conditions, together with dispersion constraints, the number of species threatened by global warming should increase in the future (

Although our study in arid lineages showed significant differences between the current distribution and potential future areas (refugia) only some species present a high risk of extinction under expected future climate-change scenarios: for the most conservative scenario (2.6), 63% of the evaluated species will retain over 80% of their distribution, 19% will retain between 60% and 80%, 14% will retain between 40% and 60%, 3% will retain between 20% and 40%, and only 1% will retain less than 20% of its distribution. For the 
 <xref rid="ref-73" ref-type="bibr">IUCN (2012)</xref>, a species is considered endangered if its population has reduced by at least 50% in 10 years or has a extend of occurrence less than 5,000 km
 <sup>2</sup>, or has an area of occupancy less than of 500 km
 <sup>2</sup>; hence, our results suggest that the species studied should not be at high risk. Although there are few studies in SDMs for semi-arid and arid ecosystems, our results are similar to those found in Namibia, for example. In that study, it was predicted that less than 5% of the species could experience a complete range reduction by 2080, although it is expected that more than 47% will have a range reduction of at least 30% by the year 2080 (
