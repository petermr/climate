<p>Niche breadth is positively correlated with the geographic distribution of species (

 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Saupe et al., 2015</xref>). In terms of climate change, we found that climatic niche breadth and similarity are positively correlated with refugia size and temperature, a result consistent with previous evidence (
 <xref rid="ref-60" ref-type="bibr">Thuiller, Lavorel &amp; Ara√∫jo, 2005a</xref>). In our arid lineages, species with wide climatic niches and more dissimilar niches (non-grouping niche position) would be less affected by global warming compared to species with more narrow climatic niches. In addition, species with narrow distributions or habitat specialist species may be more prone to extinction after climate change (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 1998</xref>), since there is a positive relationship between the size of the distribution area and species abundance (
