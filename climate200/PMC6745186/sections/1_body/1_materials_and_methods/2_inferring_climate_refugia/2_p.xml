<p>We overlapped the current distribution model of each species with the future projection according to models 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, obtaining four refugia models for each species. All spatial analyses were developed using ArcGIS 10.1 and SDM Toolbox 1.c.1. Finally, we obtained four possible results: range expansion areas (projected areas that are not currently occupied by the species); refugia areas (areas where the current distribution coincides with the future projection); and areas of contraction (current distribution areas, but which are not occupied in the projection figure).</p>
