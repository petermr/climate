<p>The climatic niche breadth and similarity of species were assessed with the raw climate values extracted directly from WorldClim using occurrence data (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>). Since it is possible to assess the niche characteristic directly, following 
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Quintero &amp; Wiens (2013a)</xref>, we calculated the temperature niche breadth as the difference between the minimum temperature of the coldest month and the maximum temperature of the wettest month, as well as the precipitation niche breadth as the difference between the precipitation of the wettest quarter and the precipitation of the driest quarter. Then, the temperature and precipitation within each locality niche breadth were calculated as the differences between their maximum and minimum values; we also calculated their variances and the variance in the position of each locality on the niche axis for all localities in each species as the niche similarity between localities. The raw data can be found in
