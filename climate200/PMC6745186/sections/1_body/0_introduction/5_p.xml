<p>In this study, we characterized the climatic niche, the size of refugia areas, and the potential expansion size area for 142 plant species from arid western South America. The core task of our study was to evaluate the relationship between niche breadth and similarity of arid-adapted plant species with the size of climatic refugia and potential expansion areas.</p>
