The impact of climate changes will be greater in the mediterranean area of Chile, where a decrease of 50% in annual rainfall and an increase of 2.5 °C in temperature are expected; in contrast, the annual precipitation and temperature in temperate forests of southern South America may increase by 5% and 1 °C, respectively (
