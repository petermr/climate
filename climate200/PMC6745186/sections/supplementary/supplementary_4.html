 <caption> Niche breadth and position over all localities for each species. Graph, WLS Ratio (WLS-Ratio as the average of proportions WL-NB / SNB; WL-NB as temperature and precipitation within each Locality Niche Breadth and SNB the overall Temperature and Precipitation Species Niche Breadth), NBV (as the variance of temperature and precipitation WL-NB) and NPV (as the variance in the position of each locality on the niche axis for all localities in each species). </caption>
