 <caption>
  <p>Temperature (°C) and precipitation (%) differences between 2041–2070 and 1971–2000 for 
   <bold>a</bold> summer averages (June–August) and 
   <bold>b</bold> annual averages according to scenario RCP 8.5 for a rectangle encompassing the BSDB south of 60 degrees. Coloured squares show the differences in the RCA4 simulations, open coloured shapes show the differences in the other regionally downscaled simulations. Each regionally downscaled projection is connected by a line to the corresponding GCM, indicated by a coloured cross. Black crosses indicate CMIP5 GCMs not used for downscaling in this study. See
