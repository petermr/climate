<p id="Par54">The SSPs selected for simulation can be alternatively interpreted as pathways with specific sets of measures that target nutrient sources directly by limiting agricultural activities, atmospheric sources, or wastewater treatment, with the changes in nutrient loads reflecting the efficiency of these measures. SSPs led to clearly deviating trajectories for nutrient loadings. The differences in nutrient loads across studied trajectories are large in comparison to the reduction potential of commonly known nutrient mitigation measures (6% and 19% reduction in phosphorus and nitrogen loads, respectively, under SSP1). For example, stakeholder-selected measures examined by Capell et al. (unpubl. results) resulted in a reduction of between &lt; 1% and 5% for both phosphorus and nitrogen loads from the BSDB (also Hasler et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). It is therefore important to continue to address the impacts of agriculture, human waste, and other anthropogenic activities on nutrient loads through management plans and policies.
