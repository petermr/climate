<p id="Par55">Increased contributions from nutrient sources under 2050s climate highlight the need for adaptation measures to counter the adverse effect of climate change on nutrient loads. Different sources respond differently to climate and societal changes, e.g. reduction in atmospheric deposition and point sources had a comparatively large effect on reducing riverine loads even within SSP2. Agriculture remains a major source of nutrients that may require drastic changes, such as those assumed in SSP1, to achieve the needed reduction.</p>
