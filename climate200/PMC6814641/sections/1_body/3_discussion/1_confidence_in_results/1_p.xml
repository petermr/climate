<p id="Par47">Estimates of nutrient loads always include uncertainties, as many locations and time-periods in the past remain unmonitored and the future is as yet unknown. Using models is an efficient way to interpolate or extrapolate across space and time, but it should be noted that the results of this model experiment are not predictions or forecasts but only meant for relative comparison of potential impacts of various changes. Nevertheless, comparing our results with those from previous studies and listing some main sources of uncertainty will give an indication of confidence in the results.</p>
