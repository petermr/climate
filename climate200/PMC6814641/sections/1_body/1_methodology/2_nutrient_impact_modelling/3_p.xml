<p id="Par29">The recalibration focused only on nutrient concentrations; model parameters that affect stream flow remained the same as in the previous E-HYPE version. At the pan-European domain, 46% of the 1015 stream gauges had Nashâ€“Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE, Nash and Sutcliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1970</xref>) greater than 0.5 and the relative error (RE) was within 50% at 85% of the gauged locations. The proportion of sites with NSE greater than 0.5 was the same in the BSDB (46% of 368 stream gauges), but a higher proportion of the sites (93%) had a relative error within 50%.
