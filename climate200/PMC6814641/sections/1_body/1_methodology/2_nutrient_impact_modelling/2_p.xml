<p id="Par28">The E-HYPE model v.3.1.4 includes deeper soils with active groundwater (European Hydrogeology map; BGR &amp; UNESCO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>) and reflects more recent crop distributions (Eurostat 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>) and point source discharges (Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016</xref>). While these updates did not significantly affect model performance, we used a stepwise, representative gauged basin (RGB) approach (Strömqvist et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>; Donnelly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>) to recalibrate selected model parameters that affect nutrient processes. In addition to the typical calibration approach where the outputs are compared to observed concentrations, we also reviewed model performance with respect to three sets of data associated with fundamental hydrological and biogeochemical processes: baseflow fraction in streamflow gauges, nitrogen leaching (Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>), and the rate of nitrogen reduction in groundwater (Højberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). However, the latter two datasets were based on model analyses and expert judgement with varying spatial resolution and tools and data inputs used to produce the estimates. For example, the rate of nitrogen reduction in groundwater for Sweden was estimated from two different national hydrological models with a median catchment size of 7 km
 <sup>2</sup>, but for Germany it was estimated as a one constant value for all contributing catchments. Thus, nitrogen leaching and the rate of nitrogen reduction in groundwater were used to guide larger spatial patterns rather than for calibrating individual catchments.
