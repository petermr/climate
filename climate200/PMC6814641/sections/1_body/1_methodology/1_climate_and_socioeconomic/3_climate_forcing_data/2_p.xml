<p id="Par20">Because the GCM/RCM combination CCLM-MPI-ESM-LR (see

 <sup>nd</sup> lowest temperature change was chosen (RCA4-CNRM-CM5). Also, three models showed very similar changes in temperature but different changes in precipitation. Thus, we chose RCA4-CanESM2 instead of Arpege-CNRM-CM5 to further diversify the GCMs in the ensemble included in the modelling (TableÂ
