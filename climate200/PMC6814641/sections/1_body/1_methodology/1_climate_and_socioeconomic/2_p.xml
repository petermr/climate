<p id="Par18">We investigate the importance of these societal developments under one climate pathway (RCP8.5). By mid-century, the differences between RCP4.5—a less extreme pathway—and RCP8.5 are not as pronounced as they become by the end of the century (Hawkins and Sutton

While higher greenhouse gas concentrations (GHC) scenarios are typically not used with SSP1, this combination is plausible by mid-century when taking into account emerging major emission sources (e.g. melting arctic peatland) from positive feedback loops in the natural system (Schuur et al.
