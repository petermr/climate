<p id="Par46">We also analysed the separate impacts of socioeconomic changes that were considered in SSP2 for individual nutrient sources under current climate (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01243-5" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supplementary Materials S1</ext-link>). These results indicated that the assumed 30% reduction in atmospheric deposition rates reduced current nitrogen loads to the Baltic Sea by about 7%. The changes in agriculture assumed under SSP2, i.e. mostly field management practices, led to more than a 3% reduction in nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea. Urban point sources reduced the total nitrogen load by more than 2% and more than 1%, respectively. For phosphorus, the assumed changes to point sources under SSP 2 dominated, decreasing total phosphorus load to the Baltic Sea by more than 7%. SSP2-assumed changes to rural sources led to about a 1% reduction in phosphorus load, whereas the SSP2 assumptions for changes in agriculture had no, or only negligible, impact on phosphorus load. Atmospheric deposition of phosphorus is not included in E-HYPE v.3.1.4 (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The sum of the individual changes to nutrient loads projected for SSP2 under current climate and the changes projected under 2050s climate did not match the changes projected for SSP2 under 2050s climate. This was expected, however, due to the interdependence of agriculture and climate, and also due to the non-linearity of formulae in the HYPE model.
