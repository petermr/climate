<p id="Par45">Overall TN load to the Baltic Sea from agriculture was not projected to change between current climate and the 2050s, although there were regional variations, most notably a decrease in agricultural nitrogen loads from the south-western half of the Baltic Sea region and an increase from other parts. There could be different explanations for this pattern, e.g. increased plant nutrient uptake due to the increasing temperature and longer growing season, higher reduction of nitrogen during subsurface and instream transport due to the combination of low to moderate increases in precipitation with increases in temperature, or simply the differing responses of different agricultural systems and nitrogen processes.</p>
