<p id="Par44">Nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea originate from multiple sources. The largest current source for both nitrogen and phosphorus loads was found to be diffuse agricultural sources (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Forests, the next largest source of nitrogen load, contributed less than half of the agricultural load. Forests cover a large area of the BSDB and contribute a significant amount of flow with high total nutrient load despite producing typically low nutrient concentrations. For phosphorus, wastewater treatment plants contributed nearly as much as agricultural sources; other sources were much less significant. The variation in simulated loads due to variability in the CMs was most pronounced for agricultural source contributions to phosphorus loads in the 2050s, likely due to changing mobilization through surface erosion and the uncertainty surrounding extreme precipitation event patterns in the CMs.
