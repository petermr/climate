<p id="Par38">Nutrient loads were projected to increase by 8% and 14% on average for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, by 2050s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This increase is largely associated with the increased total flow. Note, however, that average flow was projected to increase by 16%, which is more than the increase in either of the nutrient loads. This signifies that the average flow-weighted nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were projected to decrease. Similar increases (11% for both TN and TP loads) were projected with the E-HYPE model runs using the original calibration parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It is also notable that the variation across the climate models in projections of nutrient loads is smaller than the variation in projected discharges.
