<p id="Par16">In this study, our objective is to evaluate changes in riverine nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea that can be expected in the 2050s due to changing climate and plausible changes in socioeconomic conditions. For this, we applied scenario modelling and compared results from E-HYPE (Hundecha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>; Bartosova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>), a pan-European application of the Hydrological Predictions of the Environment (HYPE) model (Lindstr√∂m et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>), using different input data representing various climate projections and socioeconomic conditions. We used this relatively high-resolution, distributed, semi-process based hydrological and nutrient model that considers the non-linearity in the response of nutrient dynamics to changing conditions, and simulated both baseline and future nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea by forcing the model with scenarios for future climate and socioeconomic conditions. From this experiment, we could separate the impact of climate change on nutrient load from the impact of socioeconomic factors. The latter affects nutrient load through changes in land use, agricultural practices, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater emissions. The socioeconomic factors can be directly linked to local and regional decision making and are thus highly interesting for nutrient management in the BSDB.
