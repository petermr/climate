<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58884-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the geographical distribution of TSC for the CMIP5 ensemble. The latest TSCs are mostly found in the Arctic and low latitudes, the earliest TSCs in the Northern North Atlantic (NNA) and Southern Ocean, with intermediate and variable TSCs in midlatitudes. These broad patterns are consistent with the CMIP3 ensembles (shown in the SI). Figure

 <xref rid="grl58884-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> in the SI illustrate that the TSC for the globally averaged rate of warming is later than most regions because it exhibits less uncertainty and variability than warming rates at smaller spatial scales (Hawkins &amp; Sutton, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>); the area‐weighted average TSC (at the 5° × 5° spatial resolution considered here) is 2090, and the latest TSC estimated for any one 5° × 5° grid box is 2124.
