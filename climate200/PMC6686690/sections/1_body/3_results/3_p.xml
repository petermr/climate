<p>For the CMIP5 ensemble, Figure 
 <xref rid="grl58884-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the global TSC to be 2127, with a bootstrap standard error of 10.9 years. This indicates that for the RCP 4.5 scenario, it takes the models approximately a century after peak GHG emissions to reach a steady rate of warming. Note, however, that we would expect TSC to occur sooner for a scenario where GHG concentrations stabilize faster after peak emissions (Ricke &amp; Caldeira, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) or for zero emissions (e.g., Solomon et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The global TSC for the A1B and B1 scenarios are 2150 (SE = 16.3 years) and 2107 (SE = 10.8 years), respectively. TSC values for individual GCMs using an alternative method are shown in the SI.
