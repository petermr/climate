<p>If the stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations occurs, theory and modeling experiments indicate that on centennial time scales the rate of global temperature increases would steady at significantly lower rates than those of the 21st century (Hansen et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Such scenarios suggest three stages to the anthropogenic fingerprint on global temperatures: (1) a period with an anthropogenic climate signal that cannot be detected due to climate variability being larger than the signal, (2) a period of detectable and strongly increasing transient change as a result of increasing forcing, and (3) a period of slower steady changes for near constant forcing. The focus has thus far been on the time of emergence (ToE) of anthropogenic warming, which quantifies the transition between the first two stages (Diffenbaugh &amp; Scherer, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Hawkins &amp; Sutton, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Mahlstein et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) while the time of transition between the latter two has not been probed. Here, we define a “Time of Steady Change” (TSC) as the time of reaching the third stage, which, together with ToE, provides a framework to quantify the duration of the period of rapid climate change (stage 2). This has important implications for understanding regional differences in the trajectory of climate change. While the rate of warming during the period of high transience has more immediate implications for adaptation, this transition from stage 2 to stage 3 is key to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) objective of avoiding dangerous interference with the climate system (which remains relevant under the Paris agreement; Jacquet &amp; Jamieson, 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), since, for example, a longer period of rapid warming represents a greater challenge to ecosystem adaptation. Moreover, an improved understanding of this transition time will inform decision makers, such as water resource planners, where climate uncertainty has important implications for large‐scale infrastructure investments over long lifetimes such as dams (Hallegatte,
