<p>While studies characterizing the period of steady change have primarily focused on globally averaged temperature change (Gillett et al.,

 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) or spatial warming patterns over millennial time scales (Gillett et al., 
 <xref rid="grl58884-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), here we have introduced the first framework for estimating the timing of transition into this period. Just as in studies of ToE, other definitions are possible and future studies may well probe alternative definitions. While we have focused our analysis on the geographic patterns of TSC as it pertains to annual mean temperature, it is likely that the timing and spatial patterns of TSC would differ for other variables. For instance, TSC for annual rainfall is likely to be determined by large‚Äêscale circulation and changes in horizontal temperature gradients as opposed to local temperatures alone (Byrne &amp; O'Gorman,
