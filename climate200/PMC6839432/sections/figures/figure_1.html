 <caption> The differential effect of temperature on predators and prey. ( A) The effect of temperature on the attack rate of northern pike ( Esox lucius) attacking brown trout ( Salmo trutta). Attack rates are expressed as m 3 h −1, since they are measured as 1/ Pt, where P is predator density and t is time to capture. ( B) The effect of temperature on pike attacking speed and brown trout escape speed. From Öhlund et al. (2015) . </caption>
