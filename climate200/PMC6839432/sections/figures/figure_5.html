 <caption> The effect of elevated CO 2 on predator attack behaviour [left panel, ( a) predator success, ( b) predation rate, ( c) predator attack distance] and prey escape response [right panel, ( a) prey reaction distance, ( b) apparent looming threshold, ( c) prey escape distance]. Predators and prey were exposed to elevated CO 2 (880 μatm) or a present-day control (440 μatm). The prey is the planktivorous damselfish P. amboinensis and the predator is the piscivorous dottyback P. fuscus, from Allan et al. (2013). </caption>
