<p>Many organismal functions are temperature dependent, and thermal response curves have been derived that illustrate the relationship between various fundamental biological rates (such as growth, metabolic scope, metabolic rate, growth, activity and reproduction) and temperature (

Here, we discuss how temperature may specifically affect escape swimming performance and kinematics, which are relevant for predator–prey interactions. In addition, temperature can affect other traits that are key in predator–prey interactions, such as those related to brain and sensory functions, e.g. the timing of the response (
