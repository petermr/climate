<p>Each species’ capacity to acclimate to temperature change is likely to be dependent on the relative position of an individual on its thermal reaction norm, on the evolutionary history and geographical range of the species, the latitudinal/geographic location and on the thermal history of the test population. For example, while a short-term (4 days) exposure to high temperature was found to decrease directionality away from the threat in two species of coral reef fishes (
 <italic>Pomacentrus moluccensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pomacentrus amboinensis</italic>), directionality returned to control levels after a longer term (90 days) acclimation only in 
 <italic>P. moluccensis</italic> (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Seasonal variation in temperature was also found to affect responsiveness and reaction distance, since performance in these traits decreases towards the end of the spawning season (September to November) over a period of temperature decline (
