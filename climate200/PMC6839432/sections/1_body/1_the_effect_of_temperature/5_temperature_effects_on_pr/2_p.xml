<p>Studies on the effect of temperature on predator–prey interactions have used different acclimation periods, species and experimental temperatures. Different acclimation periods are ecologically relevant because of the temporally hierarchical nature of temperature fluctuations in aquatic systems. However, this diversity in the experimental approach is likely to be the main cause of some differences in the overall results, with longer acclimation periods typically showing a higher degree of compensation in performance. A week exposure to high temperature was found to increase the capture success of the fish predator (the dottyback,

 </xref>). This was likely due to a combination of effects on predators and prey. In term of the prey performance, reaction distance to the approaching predator and escape swimming decreased at high temperature. Conversely, attack rate and attack speed of the predator increased at high temperature.
