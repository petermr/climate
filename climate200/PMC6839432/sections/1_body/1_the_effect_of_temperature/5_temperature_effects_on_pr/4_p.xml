<p>Further research has suggested a decrease in predator pressure at low temperatures. This is in line with 
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">Dell 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)
 </xref>, who suggest that in ectotherm pairs of predators and prey at low temperatures, the escape speed of prey tends to remain close to peak levels and thus higher than the attack speeds of the predator. Work on pike (
 <italic>Esox lucius</italic>)—brown trout (
 <italic>Salmo trutta</italic>) interactions suggests that changes in relative speed performance were at the basis of the effect of long-term temperature exposure (3 months) on the outcome of the interactions (
 <xref rid="ref128" ref-type="bibr">Öhlund 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Attack rates decreased sharply at low temperatures (below 11°C) and mirrored a decline in the attack speed of the predator, while escape speeds remained relatively constant (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Two potential explanations were put forward: (i) low temperature affects the neural performance of fish, which is likely to have a stronger effect on the predator than on the prey, because catching a fast-moving prey is a complex task that requires synchronization of motor and cognitive processes, while escaping mainly requires rapid random motion and (ii) low temperature reduces motivation, e.g. because of lower hunger and prey availability (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Overall, these studies suggest that at lower temperatures, predator–prey interactions involving fish as prey and predators tend to decrease in frequency (
 <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the case of endotherm predators (e.g. birds and marine mammals) attacking fish, the effects of temperature are more complex and do not usually result in a reduction of hunger and food intake in the same way as for ectotherms. For example, birds (cormorants 
 <italic>Phalacrocorax carbo carbo</italic>) feeding in the winter economize energy expenditure by halving the time spent at sea, and halving the number but doubling the mass of each prey fish taken (
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">Johansen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001
 </xref>). Bailleul and colleagues suggest that after migrating to the Antarctic continent, elephant seal (
 <italic>Mirounga leonina)</italic> may target cold waters to facilitate the capture of fish prey that are less active at low temperatures (
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Bailleul 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>). It is therefore plausible that low-temperature conditions may increase the predation success rate of piscivorous endotherms (
