<p>Accordingly, marine endotherms were suggested to be competitively favoured over ectothermic predators as water temperatures decline and this may be the basis for why predators such as marine mammals and birds show high phylogenetic diversity in cold, temperate latitudes while their diversity is low in warmer regions (

Arguably, the overall effects of global warming are bound to be more complex and beyond the scope of the current review, since they can have a number of other direct and indirect effects on aquatic organisms that would impact on predator–prey interactions, such as changes in the distributional ranges of both predators and preys (
