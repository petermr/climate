<p>Temperature can have major direct or indirect effects on swimming performance and consequently on predator–prey interactions. The indirect effects are related to the well-known relationship between temperature and the general condition of the fishes, i.e. growth rate (i.e. size), condition factor, muscle content, development and reproductive status (

 <xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Importantly, an increased size, due to temperature-induced faster growth rate, can cause a higher speed because of the positive relationship between size and burst speed (

 </xref>). On the other hand, the direct effects of temperature on escape swimming performance are mainly due to the effect of temperature on muscle performance and power output, which tend to increase at higher temperatures (

 <xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">James, 2013</xref>). Acute decreases in temperature can result in a decrease in body bend and muscle strain rate during escape responses, while an acute increase in temperature increases muscle shortening speed, causing greater power output and higher escape swimming performance (
