<p>While these potential scenarios are generally supported by previous work on predator–prey interactions in hypoxia, it is worth noting that hypoxia can also be associated to some behavioural strategies by the predators or the prey to circumvent the constraints imposed by hypoxia. For example, while predation by fish tends to decrease in hypoxia, certain fish species living in stratified waters routinely undertake brief foraging forays into hypoxic habitats to catch their invertebrate prey, suggesting that foraging in hypoxic waters may be common in fish when prey abundance is low in surface waters (

 </xref>). In addition, even within fish species, there can be differences in hypoxia tolerance (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Bell and Eggleston, 2005</xref>), and it has been suggested that small fish tend to be more hypoxia tolerant that large ones, which may imply that fish prey tend to be more hypoxia tolerant than their fish predators (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Indeed, certain species of small fish were suggested to use deep hypoxic waters as a refuge from large predators (

 <xref rid="ref181" ref-type="bibr">Vejřík 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Clearly, hypoxia affects both the feeding and escape behaviour of predators and prey, as well as their habitat selection. Therefore, the complexity of the system is largely dictated by the relative hypoxia tolerances of each species involved and a modelling approach could be useful to improve our predictive ability of the effect of hypoxia on predator–prey interactions (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Future studies may benefit from emphasizing such aspects, and incorporating the different capacities that prey and predators may have for acclimating and/or adapting to the more frequent and severe hypoxia episodes that are predicted.
