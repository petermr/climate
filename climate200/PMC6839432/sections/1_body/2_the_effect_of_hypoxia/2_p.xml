<p>Fish escape locomotion relies on fast anaerobic muscle fibres; therefore, hypoxia was originally hypothesized to have no effect on a single burst swimming event (

 </xref>), mammals, and other vertebrates (
 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Fowler and Prlic, 1995</xref>). As a consequence, any effect of hypoxia on the sensory performance and neural control of escape response may also be reflected in diminished escape performance. In addition, hypoxia may limit the ability of fish to recover from anaerobic exercise, thereby limiting their potential to engage in repetitive bursts of activity. Here, we discuss how hypoxia may affect escape responses by considering both locomotor (e.g. speed and displacement) and non-locomotor traits (e.g. responsiveness and escape latency), as well as potential strategies employed by fish to minimize the negative effect of hypoxia, such as aquatic surface respiration, and the related behavioural trade-offs.
