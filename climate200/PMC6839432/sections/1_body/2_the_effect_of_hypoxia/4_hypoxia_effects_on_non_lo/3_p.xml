<p>Directionality (i.e. whether a response is directed away or towards the threat, 
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010a</xref>) was found to be impacted by hypoxia in the two species in which directionality was tested [

 <xref rid="ref104" ref-type="bibr">Lefrancois and Domenici, 2006</xref>)]. Here, fish were exposed for a few hours to oxygen conditions lower than 20 and 50% of air saturation, respectively. In both cases, hypoxia-exposed fish showed a higher proportion of responses towards the threat. This is likely to result from an inaccurate left–right discrimination of the startle direction, possibly related to sensory disorientation (
