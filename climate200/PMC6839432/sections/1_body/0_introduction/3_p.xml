<p>The outcome of predator–prey interactions is determined by their relative sensorimotor performance (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Cooper and Blumstein, 2015</xref>). Although some research has been carried out on encounters between real predators and prey, in fishes, the escape response has typically been the focus of most studies on predator–prey interactions, largely because of the ease of the experimental approach (
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Domenici 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>). Fish escape responses typically consist of two muscular contractions followed by a glide or continuous swimming (

 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Domenici and Blake, 1997</xref>). The response is usually controlled by a pair of giant neurons located in the hindbrain of most fish species, the Mauthner cells, which receive multimodal sensory input and ensure short latency responses (

 <xref rid="ref96" ref-type="bibr">Kohashi and Oda, 2008</xref>). Previous work has shown that the early stages of an escape response are fundamental in avoiding predation (

 </xref>). In fishes, escape performance can be assessed by multiple traits that include both locomotor (e.g. speed, acceleration) and non-locomotor components, primarily related to behavioural and sensory performance such as the timing, the distance and the directionality of the response (
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010a</xref>). Traits such as speed and acceleration of the escape responses are related to locomotor performance, hence muscle power and to some extent also neural control (

 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010b</xref>). On the other hand, predator and prey detection, reaction distances (i.e. the distance between the predator and prey at the time an escape is initiated, also called Flight Initiation Distance, FID,

 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Dill, 1974</xref>)], response latencies and the directionality of escape are related to neural and sensory capacity (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010a</xref>). The relative importance of each trait in determining the outcome of a given predator–prey interaction is likely to be context and species dependent (
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Domenici, 2010a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref52a" ref-type="bibr">Domenici and Hale, 2019</xref>). For example, while speed was found to be the main determinant of escape success of guppies evading their natural cichlid predator (
 <xref rid="ref184" ref-type="bibr">Walker 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>), in other predator–prey pairs, the main factor was found to be reaction distance (
