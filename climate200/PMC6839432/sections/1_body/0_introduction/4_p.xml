<p>Given the importance of predator–prey interactions in governing the distribution and abundance of marine fishes (

 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Bijma 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>), i.e. warming, acidification and hypoxia, on escape kinematics and performance, because prey have been the focus of most predator–prey studies carried out during the last couple of decades. Typically, prey responses have been studied using an artificial startling stimulus and their performance has been assessed under various levels of a given stressor. While this is a simplistic and reductionist approach, its advantage resides in assessing prey behaviour without the effect of the variability in the predator behaviour. The review will also discuss recent work based on more complex and realistic settings, in which a real predator attacking a prey was used, under various combinations of multiple stressors and, in some cases, using fluctuating levels mirroring those found in nature. Finally, we will discuss future avenues for research in which we advocate an increase in the complexity of the experiments, in terms of multiple stressors, environmental fluctuations, realistic predator–prey settings and trans-generational experiments, as well as the development of a modelling approach, in order to increase our ability to make predictions on how climate change will affect the ecology of predator–prey interactions.
