<p>Similar to temperature and hypoxia effects, exposure to both chronic and acute high CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels can affect locomotor performance, but whether the effect is negative or positive depends largely on the underlying physiology of the animal being tested. In addition, elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels can cause changes in aerobic scope (
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Couturier 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">Rummer 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>) with direct implications on the functioning of predator–prey interactions (
 <xref rid="ref155" ref-type="bibr">Rosa and Seibel, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Couturier 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). The way in which elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> affects aerobic scope has yielded contrasting results with some species showing an increase (
 <xref rid="ref156" ref-type="bibr">Rummer 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>) and other species a decrease in aerobic scope (
 <xref rid="ref119" ref-type="bibr">Munday 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). The results of the effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on aerobic scope are potentially relevant for burst swimming, despite the fact that escape locomotion is powered anaerobically. This is because any effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> conditions on aerobic scope may indirectly affect escape performance since the energy debt created by anaerobic activity has to be paid off by post-exercise oxygen consumption (
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Moyes 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993
 </xref>). However, in the Ambon damselfish (
 <italic>P. amboinensis</italic>), despite the finding of an increase in aerobic scope with increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Couturier 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>), 4 days of exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> (~900 μatm) decreased escape locomotor performance (in terms of escape distance within a fixed time) (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Similarly, a 4-day (~900 μatm) exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> negatively affected the escape swimming (mean and maximum speed) of the cinnamon clownfish (
 <italic>Amphiprion melanopus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>) and decreased the escape distance moved and average escape speed in the yellowtail kingfish (
 <italic>Seriola lalandi</italic>) [exposure period of 21 days post-hatch (~1000 μatm)] (
 <xref rid="ref188" ref-type="bibr">Watson 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). In contrast, 
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> found that there was no effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure (~900 μatm for 7 days) on escape distance, but there was a significant effect on escape speed in the Ward’s damselfish (
 <italic>P. wardi</italic>) (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Allan 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). There was also no effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure on the maximum bending angle and the duration of stage 1 in the escape response of marine medaka (
 <italic>Oryzias melastigma</italic>) following a 8–16-day embryonic exposure to two CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels (~1100 and 1800 μatm) (
 <xref rid="ref186" ref-type="bibr">Wang 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). Therefore, although the escape swimming of some species appears to be affected by high CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the results are inconsistent among species, even when they belong to the same genus.
