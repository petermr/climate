<p>The results on the few predator–prey interactions presented here make it difficult to generalize across species, let alone across families; therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting the ecological significance of these effects. Therefore, arguably, the effects of OA on fish escape responses and predator strikes, metabolism and hunger level are not sufficiently robust and the mechanistic basis not sufficiently understood, to be used for suggesting future scenarios at this time. More works on the mechanisms underpinning the effects of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> and on a large number of species and species interactions are needed in order to increase our predictive power of the effect of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on predator–prey interactions. Increasing our understanding of the effects of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on predator–prey interactions is fundamental because these effects can cascade and result in changes in the species composition of communities, potentially disrupting the stability of the ecosystem (

Therefore, knowing the physiological and neural basis of the effects of OA on predators and prey, and their relative adaptive potential, will allow us to better predict which species and which predator–prey interactions may be more sensitive than others.
