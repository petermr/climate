<p>Climate change models project that ocean pCO
 <sub>2</sub> will exceed 900 ppm by 2100 (
 <xref rid="ref115" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>) from current levels of ~ 400 ppm, leading to a decrease in ocean pH, which occurs via the dissolution of CO
 <sub>2</sub> as it is absorbed into the world’s oceans, where it is hydrated to form carbonic acid. Elevation of this primary greenhouse gas will also lead to a predicted 3–5°C increase in ocean temperatures over the same time period. The temperature dependence of chemical reactions means that levels of available oxygen within the shallow ocean will decrease. OA is predicted to affect interspecific interactions through changes in behaviour, locomotor and sensory performance (

 <xref rid="ref130" ref-type="bibr">Orr 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005
 </xref>), research in the last decade has shown that a number of behavioural disruptions in fish and marine invertebrates can occur as a consequence of exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> levels (
 <xref rid="ref124" ref-type="bibr">Nagelkerken and Munday, 2016</xref>). Recent meta-analytical work has found various effects of exposure of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> effects on calcification, metabolic rates and behavioural performances in fishes, in addition to increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for fish larvae (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). With respect to predator–prey interactions, one of the most relevant effects is the disruption of the ability to avoid predator odours, as it was found in coral reef fish larvae (

 </xref>), with potential negative consequences in terms of their survival (
 <xref rid="ref120" ref-type="bibr">Munday 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 </xref>). Recently, the kinematics and behaviour that underpin complex predator–prey interactions have also been used to characterize OA-related impairment (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018b
 </xref>). In the following section, we discuss the chronic and acute effects of OA on the kinematics and behaviour of fish escape responses, with considerations on predator–prey behaviours and their potential ecological consequences, while pointing out species-specific differences found in the responses. Research on the effect of OA on fish escape behaviour is relatively new compared to, for example, the effects of temperature. As a consequence, little is understood about the mechanisms underlying reported responses and the behavioural results are not always consistent among different species. This lack of consistency does not allow the development of hypothetical general scenarios of the effect of OA on predator–prey interactions, unlike the case of temperature and hypoxia.
