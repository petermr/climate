<p>The neural basis of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> impairment of the escape response as found in some of the species investigated is unknown. It has been hypothesized that OA may induce changes in the sensory responsiveness of the Mauthner cell or other reticulospinal cells responsible for escapes (

 <sub>2</sub> is due to disrupted neurotransmitter function, which is attributed to changes in the ion gradients over neuronal membranes (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). Interestingly, Mauthner cells have GABA receptors distributed throughout them (
 <xref rid="ref97" ref-type="bibr">Korn and Faber, 2005</xref>). GABA, acting primarily through interaction with GABA-A receptors, may cause Mauthner cell inhibition through membrane hyperpolarization and increased membrane conductance, which could potentially alter the response of the Mauthner cell (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993
 </xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the sensorimotor performance and the timing of the Mauthner cell’s firing in the more sensitive fish species are negatively affected by high-CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure, resulting in the misfiring and/or changes in the timing of the action potentials that generate escape response. This hypothesis is yet to be tested and would involve complex electrophysiology but presents an exciting avenue for future research. Allan and colleagues found that parental exposure to high CO
 <sub>2</sub> (11 months at ~1000 μatm) reduced the negative effects of increased CO
 <sub>2</sub> exposure on fish escape responses (i.e. both locomotor and non-locomotor traits), suggesting that trans-generational acclimation may occur. However, acclimation was not complete in escape speed and absent in directionality, suggesting that parental exposure does not completely compensate for the effects of high CO
 <sub>2</sub> on escape performance (
