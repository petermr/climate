<p>To date, only two studies have looked at the effect of elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature on the response of a fish to an artificial startle stimulus. Nasuchon and colleagues examined the escape response under elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> (400/1000 ppm) and temperature (15 and 19°C) of adult Japanese anchovy 
 <italic>Engraulis japonicus</italic> acclimated for 1 month (
 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">Nasuchon 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Neither CO
 <sub>2</sub> nor temperature affected the kinematic parameters analyzed (i.e. the escape trajectory, swimming velocity, acceleration, escape direction and frequency of bends), with the exception of the turning rate that was significantly higher at 19°C than at 15°C. 
 <xref rid="ref188" ref-type="bibr">Watson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2018)
 </xref> used a fully factorial design (27 and 30°C and 405 and 930 ppm CO
 <sub>2</sub>) to test the combined effects of projected climate change on the escape response of larval kingfish (
 <italic>Seriola lalandi</italic>). Here, embryos and larvae were reared under the different environmental conditions until testing at 21 days post-hatch. High temperature improved performance by increasing responsiveness and maximum speed and decreasing escape latency. However, these effects were largely driven by a temperature-related increase in body mass and thus a more developmentally advanced stage for those individuals exposed to the higher temperature. On the other hand, high CO
 <sub>2</sub> decreased distance covered and average speed during the escape but had no effect on responsiveness nor escape latency (
 <xref rid="ref188" ref-type="bibr">Watson 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2018
 </xref>). There was no interaction between CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature for any of the variables measured. These studies suggest there are likely to be species-specific differences in the response of fishes to the interacting effects of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature. Clearly, further examples are required before we can determine whether there is any phylogenetic pattern to the impact of these factors on escape performance.
