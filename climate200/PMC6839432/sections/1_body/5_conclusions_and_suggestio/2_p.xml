<p>Where possible, studies should ideally make a conscious and argued decision on the duration of exposure to the various stressors and findings and this should be put in relation to the magnitude of natural fluctuations in the environmental stressors within the study system, and their predicted changes in the future. For instance, temperatures change naturally in a hierarchy of temporal scales, with acute changes (maybe tidal or daily) within a more slowly changing average (seasonal) temperature signal. The capacity of an organism to cope with and respond to acute changes in environmental variables may then be just as important as their capacity to adjust through acclimation to seasonally driven cycles.</p>
