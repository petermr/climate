<p>The rural transport sector in the Western Cape province is already under stress, and development planning has negatively impacted the sector in that communities are being established further and further away from economic nodes (Department of Environmental Affairs and Planning, Western Cape 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The sector is a significant contributor to provincial GHG emissions, and growth in demand will exacerbate this problem. In addition, local air quality is impacted by transport. Options for mitigation in the sector include introducing cleaner fuel programmes in the provincial fuel mix and commercialising innovation in the province such as the development of South Africa’s first ‘home-grown’ electric car, being developed in Cape Town (

A bundle of measures is required to address the challenges. Options to adapt include integrating climate risks into development planning and approval processes; enhancing the emergency services and integrating climate risk into disaster management processes and systems; and maintaining livelihoods (such as rural livelihoods) as far as possible to minimise population stress in urban centres (World Bank
