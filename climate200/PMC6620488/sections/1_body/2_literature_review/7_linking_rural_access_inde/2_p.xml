<p>Although the transport acknowledgement in the SDGs is much clear in the context of urban infrastructure and resilience in cities (which is however not enough), this is however viewed as a good starting point. Similar inroads regarding the acknowledgement and strategic positioning and leadership role being granted for rural transport will lead to a complete inclusion of transport in seeking to promote and support the realisation of the SDGs. As an example, Target 9.1 of the SDGs seeks to develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. In the short term, enhancing one aspect of decent infrastructure (i.e. rural road connectivity) reduces transport costs and improves access to markets and social facilities such as schools and hospitals. In the longer term, it elevates agricultural productivity, business profitability and employment, which reflects the aims of SDG Target 2.3 â€“ doubling the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers. Better connectivity also strengthens the resilience of rural populations to natural and human-made shocks and disasters by facilitating the movement of people and supplies for faster recovery (IPCC
