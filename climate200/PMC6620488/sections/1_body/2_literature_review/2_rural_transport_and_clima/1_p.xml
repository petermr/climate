<p>Climate change is a major threat to sustainable development in South Africa (SAEON 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Inherently, climate change poses one of the greatest threats towards the achievement of the SDGs. This is because South Africa is one of the highest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitting nations in the African continent (i.e. an average of 8.9 tonnes per capita) (Olivier et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Greenhouse gas emissions in South Africa mainly emanate from the industrial and mining hubs. These emissions are driven by a sharp increase in fossil fuel use. At the same time, South Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, including more frequent droughts, floods and other extreme events and related reductions in agricultural productivity, accessibility and mobility constraints, threats to food security and risks of conflict over scarce land and water resources (refer to works by Nhemachena 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nhemachena &amp; Hassan 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). This context highlights the compelling need to explore the climate change narrative meaning for rural transport in South Africa.
