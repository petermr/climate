<p>The third category includes climate scenario data. There is great uncertainty in the application of climate models: On the one hand, there are great differences between the simulation results of the model and the measured values; on the other hand, it is difficult to give the same changing trend of the simulation results of different models [

In addition, Shaowu et al. found that the uncertainty of the global climate model is mainly reflected in three aspects: the unpredictability of the economy, the difference of the model, and the uncertainty when using the atmospheric circulation model to drive the regional model. Among them, the difference of the model mainly manifested in that each model has its own characteristics and advantages, and the physical processes of different models are different. [
