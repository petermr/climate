<p>In this study, we use the Water and Energy transfer Process (WEP) model for the basin to simulate the hydrological cycle. The water and energy transfer processes (WEP) model [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] was developed by combining the merits of the PBSD models and SVAT models. The WEP model has the following main characteristics: (1) it combines the modeling of hydrological processes and energy transfer processes; (2) the model could directly reflect topographyâ€™s effects in runoff generation; (3) the mosaic method [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] is used in the computation unit due to the heterogeneity of landuse [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Previous studies have widely applied this model in different watersheds (especially in the Yellow basin) with various climate and geographic conditions [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Because its main characteristics are more suitable in the basin, and the model is widely used in the Yellow River Basin, the WEP model was selected for this study.
