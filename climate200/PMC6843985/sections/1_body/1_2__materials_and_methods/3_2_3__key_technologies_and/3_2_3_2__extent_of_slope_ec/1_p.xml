<p>Based on the landuse in 1980, 2000 and 2017, the forest land was extracted by the tools of “Select by attributes” and “Export data” in ArcGIS. It is assumed that the forest land in 1980 (WL80) was “natural forest land”, and the newly added forest land in landuse in 2000 and 2017 was the slope ecological restoration of 1980–2000 and 1980–2017 respectively. Assuming that forest land (WL00) was “natural forest land”, the newly added forest land in landuse in 2017 was the slope ecological restoration from 2000 to 2017. By superimposing the above slope ecological restoration in the three periods in the landuse for 1980 and 2000, respectively, the underlying surface scenarios, considering slope ecological restoration in the three periods of 1980–2000, 1980–2017, and 2000–17 can be obtained (
