<p>This study first constructed a distributed hydrological model WEP, which simulated the runoff process in the study area from 1965 to 2017. Based on the results of the slope ecological restoration, the impacts of slope ecological restoration on the runoff in different seasons were quantitatively identified. Furthermore, we selected three RCPs including RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 as representatives of high, medium and low emission scenarios. Based on the statistical analysis method, the multivariate linear regression model was established, and used to generate a set of gathered climate scenario data. Compared with the five GCMsâ€™ data, the gathered data is more suitable for the basin. The slope ecological restoration scenarios in different periods were combined with climate scenarios to explore the mitigation effects of future climate change.</p>
