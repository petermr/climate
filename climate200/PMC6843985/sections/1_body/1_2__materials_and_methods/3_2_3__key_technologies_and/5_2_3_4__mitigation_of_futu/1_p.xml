<p>In this study, the three emission scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were selected to estimate the temporal and spatial evolution trend of runoff from 2021 to 2050. Then, combining the slope ecological restoration scenarios with the climate scenarios, the influences of the three periods of slope ecological restoration on future runoff were analyzed under each climate scenario. The differences were then compared in the runoff variation under different climate scenarios, and then were explored whether slope ecological restoration had a greater mitigation effect on the extreme value process. By comparing the differences of the runoff change under different climate scenarios, we explored whether slope ecological restoration had a greater mitigation effect on the extreme value process.</p>
