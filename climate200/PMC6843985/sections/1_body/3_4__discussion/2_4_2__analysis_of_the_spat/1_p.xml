<p>Compared with S80, the results of S8000, S0017, and S8017 showed an increase in the runoff variability in Shiyazhuang and Xiachuan which was located in the upper reaches above Xining, but the Qiaotou and Chaoyang showed an increasing trend. Therefore, the change of the CV in Xining was not obvious. The CV of Baliqiao located in the downstream basin below Xining Station, increased significantly, which led to a slight increase in Minhe. According to the results in the different seasons, the results of the wet season showed the same trend as the whole year, while the results in the temperate season and dry season showed a decreasing trend in the CV. Comprehensively, the increase in the annual CV of Qiaotou and Chaoyang were mainly due to the impact of the wet season, which may be due to the fact that grassland accounts for the majority of the landuse categories in the Qiaotou and Chaoyang watershed. Moreover, the forest land proportions were relatively small, so the effects in the wet season were weak. In addition, there are many factors affecting the CV, such as precipitation, ice and snow melt water. Upstream of the Beichuan River, where Qiaotou and Chaoyang are located, is in the transition zone between the Loess Plateau and the Tibetan plateau. It has hydrological characteristics of the alpine regions and snow cover. The problem, however, is more complicated. Studies have shown that after forest disturbances, greater snow accumulation is estimated (melting earlier and faster [

Therefore, from the perspective of runoff variability, slope ecological restoration has the effect of “eliminating peak and replenishing dry” and presents a certain spatial heterogeneity.
