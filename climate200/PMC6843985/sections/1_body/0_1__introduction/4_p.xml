<p>The overall objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of slope ecological restoration and future climate change on runoff process for Huangshui River basin. This objective was achieved by performing the following four steps: (1) Based on the law of forest land variation, the scope of slope ecological restoration in different periods (1980, 1980–2000, 2000–07, and 1980–2017) was quantitatively identified; (2) a runoff simulation was performed for the period from 1965 to 2017 under different slope ecological restoration scenarios using the Water and Energy transfer Processes (WEP) distributed hydrological model, as well as an exploration of the impacts of slope ecological restoration on the runoff process; (3) a runoff simulation was done for the period from 2021 to 2050 under different slope ecological restoration scenarios, as well as three RCPs, the RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) are the three representative pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); (4) examining the impacts of slope ecological restoration on future runoff process (2021–50) under future climate scenarios. The results of this study should improve our understanding of variations in runoff under slope ecological restoration, and the potential of slope ecological restoration to mitigate future climate change. It will provide reference for better water resources management of the Yellow basin in the future. This management will be vital for building an ecological civilization and restoring key ecosystems to strengthen the quality and stability of the ecosystems in China.</p>
