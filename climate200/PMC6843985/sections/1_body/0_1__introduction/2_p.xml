<p>Scholars have done considerable research on the impact assessments of climate change on regional runoff. The research has mainly focused on contribution rate analyses of historical meteorological data to runoff [

Field experiments usually investigate the effect of forest changes on runoff through long-term planting. Hatma investigated the effects of vegetation changes on the rainfall-runoff response in different types and periods of pine forest plantation based on their respective forestry treatments by experiments in pine forest and mixed-plant forest catchments. Chu et al. carried out an experiment on a eucalyptus plantation in South China to assess the effects of the enriched planting of native tree species on the surface water, soil erosion, and nutrient losses. However, the field experiments take considerable time and are limited by site scales [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The analysis of historical data is usually based on a regression analysis of long-term data, and a high accuracy is required for the data [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In recent years, there have also relevant studies that simulated the responses of different afforestation scenarios to runoff through the establishment of hydrological models [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but most of these studies did not follow the law of forest land variation, and the definition of slope ecological restoration scope is still lacking.
