<p>Climate change and human activities (e.g., slope ecological restoration) are important factors that have affected the hydrological cycle of river basins in recent years [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and they are also major research issues in the field of hydrology at present [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rising temperatures caused by climate change are accelerating the processes of global and regional water cycles, thereby leading to changes in atmospheric circulation, precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, and river runoff, as well as temporal and spatial change of water resources [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, due to the implementation of slope ecological restoration, the vegetation scale has increased, followed by the changes in surface roughness, which also directly or indirectly affect the above process [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, because of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate change, vegetation plays a vital role in maintaining the climate stability of the terrestrial ecosystem [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the interaction of various factors on the watershed scale may have compounding effects, resulting in changes of the surface runoff process [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-04017" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, considering future climate conditions, how slope ecological restoration will affect the temporal and spatial distribution of runoff and the variability of runoff process deserves further exploration.
