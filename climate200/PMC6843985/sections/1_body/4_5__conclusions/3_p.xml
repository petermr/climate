<p>The slope ecological restoration in different periods has an obvious impact on the runoff process. The slope ecological restoration significantly reduced the runoff for the whole year, the wet season, and the temperate season but increased the runoff during the dry season. From the perspective of the CV value, the influence of slope ecological restoration on the runoff variation is spatially inconsistent. Overall, the slope ecological restoration effectively reduced the variability of the surface runoff process in the temperate and dry seasons.</p>
