<p>By comparing the runoff changes of the key sections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04017-f014">Figure 14</xref>), under the same RCP, except for Xinachuan, the annual average runoff and the runoff in the wet season both increased compared with that of S80, while the runoff in the temperate season and dry season decreased. Under the same slope ecological restoration scenario (S8000, S8017, and S0017), the annual runoff of the three RCPs was similar, but the runoff in different hydrological seasons was different. In the wet season, the runoff of the three climate scenarios showed a trend of S45 &lt; S26 &lt; S85, S26 &lt; S85 &lt; S45 in the temperate season, and S45 &lt; S85 &lt; S26 in the dry season, which were basically the same as the results of S80.
