<p>Furthermore, the study calculated the runoff CV in different seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-04017-f016">Figure 16</xref>). The results of the wet season were similar to those for the whole year. Under the same RCP, slope ecological restoration reduced the CVs of Chaoyang and Qiaotou effectively, and also slowed the trend of increasing CVs for Xining. Under different RCPs, in the S8000, S8017 and S0017, the CVs presented in the following orders: CV45 &gt; CV26 &gt; CV85, which are the same as the results of S80. According to the results for the temperate season, the slope ecological restoration increased the variability of the runoff process under the same RCPs, and the results of S8000, S8017, and S0017 under different RCPs were the same as those of S80, as well. The results for the dry season were also more diverse. Under the same RCPs, the slope ecological restoration increased the CV of the runoff process of every section (except for Baliqiao). Under different RCPs, the results under S8000, S8017 and S0017 were quite different from those of S80, and the arrangement of CVs of Minhe from small to large was: CV85 &gt; CV45 &gt; CV26, while other sections were: CV45 &gt; CV85 &gt; CV26. Overall, during the next 30 years, slope ecological restoration may have a greater impact on the runoff variation process in the dry season and have less of an impact on runoff variability in the wet season and the temperate season.
