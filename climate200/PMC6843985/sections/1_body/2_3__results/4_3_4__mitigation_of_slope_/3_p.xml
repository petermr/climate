<p>In addition, the study calculated the CV of the annual runoff (

Under the same RCP, overall, the slope ecological restoration scenarios increased the variability of the runoff process, especially S0017 and S8017. However, the Qiaotou and Chaoyang on the Beichuan River had the opposite result, that is, the slope ecological restoration scenarios reduced the variability of the runoff process. It reduced the runoff variability of the main stream Xining Station to some extent. Under the different RCPs, no matter what kind the slope ecological restoration scenarios were, except for Minhe, the arrangement of the CVs of other sections presented a trend of CV26 &gt; CV45 &gt; CV85, which was the same as the results of S80 (no slope ecological restoration). According to the Minhe, the CVs of S0017 and S8017 were different from those of S80: CV85 &gt; CV45 &gt; CV26. The results revealed that slope ecological restoration has affected the hydrological rhythm under the future climate scenarios to some extent.
