<p>In this section, the study compared the effects of slope ecological restoration in different periods on the runoff under climate scenarios, assuming that the responsive relationship between the climate variables and runoff will remain the same [

Overall, under the same RCPs, the annual average runoff of the S0017 and S8017 both increased by 20%, compared with that of S80, while the slope ecological restoration reduced the average annual runoff under historical climate conditions. Thus, under the same slope ecological restoration scenarios, the runoff evolution was different due to changes in climate conditions. Therefore, the future runoff evolution in this study area was mainly affected by climate change. According to the different seasons, the runoff of S0017 and S8017 increased by more than 50% compared with that of S80 in the wet season and dry season, and reduced by about 55% in the temperate season. Therefore, under the climate scenarios, the slope ecological restoration scenarios mainly affected the runoff in the temperate season, while in the wet season and the dry season the runoff was still mainly affected by climate change.
