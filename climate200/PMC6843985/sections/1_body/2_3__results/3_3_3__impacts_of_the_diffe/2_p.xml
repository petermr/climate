<p>Furthermore, we analyzed the CV of different periods of the slope ecological restoration scenarios for the seven key sections. For the annual and wet season results, compared with the CVS80, the CVS8000, CVS8017, and CVS0017 of Shiyazhuang and Xinachuan showed a decreasing trend. The CVs in Qiaotou and Chaoyang showed a slightly increasing trend. These had effects on the downstream in Xining, resulting in no significant changes in its CV. Moreover, compared with CVS80, CVS8000, CVS8017 and CVS0017 of Baliqiao on the downstream tributary showed an increasing trend. Therefore, the CV of the Minhe near the exit of the mainstream showed a slightly increasing trend. According to the results of the temperate season, compared with CVS80, CVS8017 and CVS0017 of Baliqiao showed a slightly increasing trend, while the trend of the other sections was decreasing. Similar trends were also found for the dry season (
