  <p>Projected changes in precipitation (in %) over the twenty-first century under a high climate forcing scenario (RCP8.5). Stippling indicates where the multi-model mean change is large compared with natural internal variability in 20â€‰year means (greater than two standard deviations) and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change.
