<p>Lack of agreed upon theoretical predictions is related to the fact that different drivers of change can act in opposite directions, so the result is often a small difference of large terms [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Lack of detection in observations is related to the small signal-to-noise ratio of forced circulation changes, reflecting the fact that climate variability is primarily a dynamical phenomenon [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Lack of model agreement is related to both these issues, and to the fact that circulation changes are often quite sensitive to model biases, which can be substantial [
