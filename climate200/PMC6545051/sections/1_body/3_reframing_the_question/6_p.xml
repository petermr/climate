<p>Reframing the climate risk question in this way increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the climate information by explicitly accounting for the correlated nature of epistemic uncertainty. An example is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F2">figure 2</xref>. The Mediterranean region receives most of its precipitation during the winter season, so the predicted wintertime drying of the region, which is a robust feature of climate model projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F1">figure 1</xref>), has important consequences. The extent of the drying will depend on the global warming level, and it is relevant to ask, for instance, what would be the difference between 1.5°C and 2.0°C of global warming. However, the extent of the drying will also depend on the pattern of circulation change in the region—an epistemic uncertainty—which can be characterized by physically coherent storylines [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Considering just the range between the low-impact and high-impact storylines shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F2">figure 2</xref>, the difference in drying between 1.5°C and 2.0°C of global-mean warming under the standard probabilistic framing is the difference between 0.09 [0.04 to 0.15] and 0.12 [0.05 to 0.20] mm d

 <italic>a</italic>), which would be considered indeterminate within the stated uncertainties. The storyline framing of the difference is, by contrast, a deterministic 0.04 versus 0.05 for the low-impact circulation storyline, 0.09 versus 0.12 for the median storyline and 0.15 versus 0.20 for the high-impact storyline (

 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to a change that is statistically detectable, and 0.19 to one standard deviation of the interannual variability—quite a large change, probably requiring significant adaptation measures. The distinction between the two approaches is analogous to that between accuracy and precision; sometimes, the latter is all that is needed for decision-making.
