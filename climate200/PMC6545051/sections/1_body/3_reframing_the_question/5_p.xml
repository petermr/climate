<p>This representation of the climate risk problem provides a natural framework for storyline approaches. For example, from the perspective of the Paris Agreement, one may ask the question of what the climate impacts would be at different levels of global-mean warming, and what different mitigation pathways would lead to those warming levels [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The epistemic uncertainty in climate sensitivity now no longer affects the estimation of climate impacts, but is instead relevant to the carbon budget allowed by the given level of warming. The epistemic uncertainty in future dynamical conditions (for a given level of global-mean warming) can then be managed via storylines, the simplest of which is that the changes in hazard are dominated by the thermodynamic effects arising from the regional temperature changes, with the forced changes in dynamical conditions assumed to be negligible. Given the large uncertainties in the forced dynamical changes, this can be considered a reasonable null hypothesis for climate change [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and it is far from uninformative. It is in fact the basis for all of the predicted changes in extremes shown in table SPM.1 of the IPCC WGI Fifth Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It also underlies the ‘surrogate climate change’ (also known as ‘pseudo-global warming’) methodology [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which is widely used in extreme-event attribution. However, specific storylines of forced circulation change can also be considered [
