<p>Storylines are ideal vehicles for quantifying the impacts of climate change and adaptation measures. They provide a way of dealing with singular historical events, which within the probabilistic framework are merely accidents within a phase space of unrealized possibilities, yet often provide benchmarks for resilience; and with the local context, where the human element becomes part of the analysis rather than a confounding factor. For example, rather than seeking to determine the recurrence likelihood of a particularly damaging storm (an inherently fuzzy question since every storm is unique), one can ask how much worse the flooding would be in a warmer, moister climate [

Such conditioning of the question enormously reduces the dimension of the problem and thereby allows the use of much more realistic modelling tools, which users of climate information can relate to. In this way, the storyline approach addresses the needed reframing of the climate risk problem while representing the epistemic uncertainties in a traceable manner.
