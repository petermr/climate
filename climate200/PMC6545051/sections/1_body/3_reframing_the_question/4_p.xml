<p>The different uncertainties that are relevant to climate risk, and the different human decision points, can be broadly represented as follows. There is uncertainty in the future climate forcing, which is mainly anthropogenic in origin, and represents the mitigation options. This combines with the epistemic uncertainty in climate sensitivity to determine the global-mean warming level. While there is some aleatoric uncertainty in the global-mean warming, it is small compared with the forced response on decadal or longer time scales. A given global-mean warming level will be associated with distinct patterns of regional warming (e.g. land warms more than ocean, the Arctic warms more than lower latitudes during the winter season), including changes in lapse rate [

These regional warming patterns are largely explainable from thermodynamic principles and thus are fairly well understood, though they have substantial quantitative epistemic uncertainty (including the possibility of tipping points). A given global-mean warming level will also be associated with particular dynamical conditions in any specific region (including the circulation effects of coupled atmosphereâ€“ocean variability), which have a very large aleatoric component but whose forced changes are also highly uncertain. The regional warming patterns and dynamical conditions together produce hazards such as weather or climate extremes, which then combine with the non-climatic anthropogenic factors of vulnerability and exposure to create climate impacts.
