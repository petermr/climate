<p>The uncertainty in the climate response to forcing is conceptually very different. It is not a property of the physical climate system; rather, it is a property of a state of knowledge, or degree of belief, and it 
 <italic>can</italic> be reduced as knowledge improves. In contrast with aleatoric uncertainty, which is objective, such epistemic uncertainty is 
 <italic>subjective</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, treating epistemic uncertainty as if it were aleatoric, with a focus on the multi-model mean as a best estimate, has no epistemological justification. This has been recognized for some time [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but the practice continues to be normative (e.g. as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPA20190013F1">figureÂ 1</xref>). It is interesting to consider why this is so, since, in most areas of science, the essential distinction between systematic and random sources of uncertainty is well recognized. One of the reasons may be that the extent of the epistemic uncertainty is not particularly well known. First, climate models are imperfect representations of reality and share many deficiencies, thus they may exhibit a collective bias and fail to explore important aspects of climate change. Second, even within the world represented by climate models, the forced circulation response of any particular model is obscured by internal variability.
