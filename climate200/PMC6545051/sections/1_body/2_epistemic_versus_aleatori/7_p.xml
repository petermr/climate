<p>Another conceptual challenge in dealing with the epistemic uncertainty of climate change is that the concept of ‘error’ is not well defined. Although in principle there may be one truth, it is not knowable: there will never be sufficient observations to define all relevant aspects of future climate; future climate will in any case be non-stationary; and model projections are based on climate forcing scenarios that will not be the ones actually realized. Thus, there has been interest in trying to understand the relationship between model errors in observable aspects of climate and the forced response simulated by that model—so-called emergent constraints (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, there is a danger that any such relationship is merely statistical and not causal, and many published emergent constraints have been subsequently debunked (see [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). In any case, subjective choices are required in the application of any such constraints.
