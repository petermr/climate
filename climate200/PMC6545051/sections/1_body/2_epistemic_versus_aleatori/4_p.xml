<p>The concept of internal variability is not without ambiguity since climate has various sources of non-stationarity, and what is meant by internal variability is conditional on any non-stationary influence, including climate change itself. Furthermore, knowledge of internal variability is limited by the finite observational record, and there is uncertainty in how internal variability will respond to global warming. Nevertheless, in most cases, the main uncertainty in what climate conditions will be experienced at a particular place and time arising from internal variability can be considered to be aleatoric, and thus amenable to a straightforward (i.e. frequentist) probabilistic interpretation. The reliability of model simulations of internal variability can be similarly assessed, at least in principle.</p>
