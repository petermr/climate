<p>This perspective also involves an acknowledgement that climate-relevant decisions, especially at the local scale, are not usually made on the basis of climate change alone but involve many other changing factors, most of which are highly uncertain. If climate impacts 
 <italic>I</italic> are a product of hazard 
 <italic>H</italic>, vulnerability 
 <italic>V</italic> and exposure 
 <italic>E</italic>, then, conceptually, the anthropogenic changes in 
 <italic>I</italic> can be represented as

 </disp-formula> It may well be that the largest terms on the right-hand side of (6.2) are the first two, where it is the combination of climate and weather 
 <italic>variability</italic> with changing vulnerability and exposure that is the main determinant of climate risk [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this case, the decision framework is not so much that of dealing with climate change as it is that of bringing climate information into decisions that need to be made in any case. There are calls for this sort of complex-systems thinking in other areas of science, such as public health [
 <xref rid="RSPA20190013C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, p. 2602]: ‘Instead of asking whether an intervention works to fix a problem, researchers should aim to identify if and how it contributes to reshaping a system in favourable ways’.
