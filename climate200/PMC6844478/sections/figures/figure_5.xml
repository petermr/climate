 <caption>
  <p>Temporal trends in sea-surface temperature in regions 1–5 (a-e, respectively) at the 20-30m depth contour and for all depth contours over the study area between 1992 and 2015. Annual averages of sea-surface temperature are presented ± standard error (SE). Box and whisker plot (f) showing variations in sea-surface temperature measured from all depth contours and at the 20-30m depth contour in regions 1–5. Confidence Limits: box limits = 25th and 75th percentiles, whisker limits = 5th and 95th percentiles.</p>
