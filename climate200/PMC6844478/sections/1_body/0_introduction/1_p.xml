<p>Fisheries management requires stock assessments to account for variations in the life history traits of fish populations that alter the way they respond to fishing pressure [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The size at onset of sexual maturity, herein referred to as size at maturity, is a key population parameter used to guide the setting of minimum legal size limits in fisheries worldwide, yet may vary spatially and temporally in response to factors such as age, growth rate, temperature, population density, food availability or their interaction [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In lobster fisheries, minimum legal size limits are routinely set using the average length (carapace lengthâ€”CL) at which 50% of females are mature (L
 <sub>50</sub>), based on the assumption that this affords juvenile stages protection from fishing mortality and allows at least 50% of females to spawn at least once before being harvested [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While minimum legal size limits are often set, understanding spatial and temporal variations in size at maturity across a fished stock is crucial to fisheries management because the relationship between minimum legal size limits and size at maturity is intrinsically linked to the fraction of mature biomass that is harvested, and resulting egg production, larval settlement and recruitment [
