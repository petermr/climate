<p>The presence of ovigerous setae on female spiny lobsters is often used as a cost-effective diagnostic tool for assessing size at maturity in stock assessment, but has been criticised for having potential bias towards larger estimates of size at maturity if setae are not retained during the moult phase [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] detected no loss of ovigerous setae in Southern Rock Lobster following moulting. However, the study did identify a seasonal (within year) component to size at maturity estimates, which the authors attributed to factors that may affect catch composition (e.g. Southern Rock Lobster movement, catchability), and recommended that sampling occur outside major biological events of moulting, mating and larval release. We consider that there is limited potential for this bias to exist in our study because our analyses was restricted to data collected during the fishing season between October and May, and therefore outside the breeding and moulting period for female Southern Rock Lobster in South Australia [
