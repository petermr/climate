<p>That withstanding, it is important to consider the overall limitations of using fishery-dependent CPUE as a measure of abundance in our study, as catch rates can also be influenced by factors such as gear selectivity, changes in fishing patterns, fleet efficiency or fleet dynamics over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Within the South Australian Southern Rock lobster Fishery, two lines of evidence suggest that catch rate trends largely reflect overall lobster abundance. Firstly, trends are highly consistent across large spatial scales. For example, across regions 1 to 3 of this study, catch rate simultaneously decreased from 1991 to 2008, increased briefly to 2011, before again decreasing over the next four seasons. In addition, catch rate trends are shown in this study and others [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] to be are consistent with depth in South Australia. Overall, these observations suggest recruitment in the fishery occurs across large spatial scales with any changes in CPUE sufficiently captured in the high level of seasonal and spatial coverage (&gt;1 million potlifts annually) used in catch rate estimation.
