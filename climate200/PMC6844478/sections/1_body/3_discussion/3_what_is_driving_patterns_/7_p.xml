<p>No significant change in size at maturity or sea-surface temperature was detected in region 4 since 1991. Region 4 is also influenced by upwelling events that originate to the south east in region 5, where along-shore wind stress from predominating south-easterly winds in summer and a narrow shelf leads to upwelling of water from depths of 250m that may be transported up to 400km over a 10 day period [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The intrusion of upwelled water onto the shelf in these regions is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g008">Fig 8</xref>. No bottom temperature measurements are available from region 4 so the nature of the relationship between upwelling, sea-surface temperature, bottom temperature and size at maturity remains largely unknown. In region 5, corresponding increases in size at maturity and sea-surface temperature since 1991, and bottom temperature since 1998, support temperature as a key factor determining size at maturity in this region. Similar to region 3, region 5 is also influenced by upwelling. However, unlike region 3, upwelling more regularly reaches the surface in region 5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], resulting in a well-mixed water column across the shelf, and as a consequence, trends in sea-surface temperature in this region are likely to be a good proxy for trends in bottom temperature. It should also be noted that bottom temperature data derived from loggers in region 5 have previously been shown to be strongly correlated with a semi-global ocean circulation model [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] indicating that data recorded from loggers are representative of actual bottom temperatures across the region.
