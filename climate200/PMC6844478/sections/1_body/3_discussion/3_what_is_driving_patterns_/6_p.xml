<p>Although bottom temperature data recorded in our study from region 3 are only available since 2008, observations indicate that between 2013 and 2016, a total of 43 days recorded bottom temperatures of &lt;12°C. This contrasts with bottom temperature data recorded between 2008 and 2012, when only 5 days recorded bottom temperatures of &lt;12°C. These observations indicate the existence of temporal variations in the frequency and intensity of upwelling in this region with a decreasing trend in bottom temperature apparent since 2008, and negative bottom temperature anomalies observed between 2013 and 2016. Consequently, there is evidence that upwelling has been more intense in region 3 since 2013, and is acting to lower bottom temperatures, and decrease growth rates and size at maturity of lobsters in this region. Longer time series of bottom temperature data are required to draw better conclusions as to the nature of trends in upwelling frequency and intensity in region 3, and any resulting effects on size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster, however it is worth noting that upwelling events are predicted to intensify under global climate warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. If so, it is possible that estimates of size at maturity of Southern Rock Lobster in this region could decrease further.
