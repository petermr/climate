<p>Our data did not allow comparison of size at maturity in fished versus unfished components of the population. We hypothesised that size at maturity was driven by either temperature or density (CPUE), and the results of our best fitting GLM indicate that neither hypothesis could be rejected, with our most well supported model including the significant factors of region, CPUE and a region*sea-surface temperature interaction. Standardised beta coefficients within our best fitting GLM also did not help explain which factor, CPUE or regional SST trends, most contribute to the variations in size at maturity observed. The declining trends in fishery CPUE across all five regions of the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery since 1991 indicate a widespread decrease in the density of Southern Rock Lobster. Catch rate is regularly used in crustacean stock assessments [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as an indicator of relative abundance and the trends in CPUE reported in our study are similar to those reported in other Southern Rock Lobster fisheries across south-eastern Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The significant negative relationship between CPUE and size at maturity within our GLM is supportive of the hypothesis that a lower density of Southern Rock Lobster is increasing growth rates, resulting in increases in size at maturity, and could help explain the increases in size at maturity observed in regions 1, 2 and 5 since 1991 under declining trends in relative abundance. However, the significant declining trends in size at maturity in region 3 since 1991 and lack of temporal responses in size at maturity in region 4 under similar declines in relative abundance, are at odds with the hypothesis that size at maturity is being shaped by density-dependent processes.
