<p>The low genetic diversity of Southern Rock Lobster across southern Australia is ascribed to a long planktonic phase and wide ranging larval dispersal, and points to the spatio-temporal differences in size at maturity recorded across the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery as being phenotypic rather than genotypic [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Of the abiotic and biotic processes likely to influence growth and resulting size at maturity in lobster populations, climatic and density-dependent factors have received the most attention. However, attributing changes in size at maturity to either environmental and/or density-dependent factors is made difficult by the need to experimentally control for the influence of each factor. Neither temperature nor density could be attributed to decreasing temporal trends in size at maturity in female American Lobster (

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In Southern Rock Lobster, estimates of size at maturity in fished versus unfished areas in Tasmania were found to be similar despite large differences in lobster density [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], indicating that size at maturity is regulated by factors other than density. In contrast, a study of size at maturity in the Spiny Lobster (
 <italic>Palinurus elephas</italic>) recorded smaller estimates of size at maturity inside a marine reserve characterised by relatively high densities of lobsters, but also noted that the patterns in size at maturity observed may have been environmentally driven [
