<p>The declining gradient in size at maturity estimates from north to south recorded in our study support the hypothesis that water temperature is a key factor determining growth rates and resulting size at maturity in Southern Rock Lobster populations. The observed increases in size at maturity since 1991 in regions 1, 2 and 5 are also consistent with the increasing sea-surface temperature measured in these regions. However, the decreases in size at maturity observed in region 3, near western Kangaroo Island (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g001">Fig 1</xref>), are at odds with the increases in sea-surface temperature recorded in this region. The depth to which satellite derived sea-surface temperature measurements represent sub-surface temperatures in the benthic environment is likely to be dependent on local oceanographic conditions and is acknowledged as not being spatially or temporally consistent [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Comparison of data relating to sea-surface and bottom temperatures derived from bottom loggers in our study is made difficult by the temporal and spatial mismatches over which the data has been collected in each region. An understanding of the physical oceanographic characteristics occurring in each region gained from previous studies, coupled with information relating to the annual sea-surface and bottom temperature data presented, provides insight into the processes that may be shaping the patterns of size at maturity observed.
