<p>Marine climate research in Australia indicates that ocean temperatures have increased in the last century and that rates of warming have risen each decade. Average sea-surface temperature around Australia measured between 1992 and 2011 was 0.68°C higher than measured for period 1910–1929, and rates of warming also rose from 0.08°C/decade in 1920–2011 to 0.11°C/decade in 1950–2011 [

 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The 0.02–0.03°C per year increases in sea-surface temperature recorded in our study since 1992 are the first documented for the region and are nearly double that reported for the Australian region on average, highlighting the importance of examining biophysical relationships at spatially relevant scales.
