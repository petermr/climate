<p>How current harvest dynamics, management rules, and changes in size at maturity interact to influence Southern Rock Lobster populations is a key question for fisheries management. Any excessive removal of immature Southern Rock Lobster has the potential to lead to less egg production, less yield per recruit, and growth overfishing [

Future management would benefit from research that assesses the sensitivity of Southern Rock Lobster populations and fishery economic yield to the changes in size at maturity predicted in our study under varying minimum legal size limits and harvest rates. Ongoing collection of spatially relevant growth and size at maturity data is also recommended to refine the inputs of stock assessment models and inform future management strategies in the future. As ocean temperatures are predicted to warm further, our study highlights the need for the collection of better oceanographic information for integration into stock assessment models. Collection of bottom temperature data from spatially representative sites for incorporation into oceanographic models is seen as a priority and would enhance the understanding of environmental processes affecting a range of benthic fisheries. Such information could be integrated into future stock assessment models to enhance harvest strategy development, allow timely adaptive management decisions and increase the resilience of fisheries to the impacts of climate change.
