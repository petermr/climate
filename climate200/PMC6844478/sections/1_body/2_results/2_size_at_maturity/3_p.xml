<p>Regions 1, 2 and 3 comprise a large proportion of the Northern Zone management area, which has been the subject of two adjustments in the minimum legal size limit over the period of our study (1995: 98.5 to 102 mm CL; 2000: 102 to 105 mm CL). The increasing temporal trend in size at maturity in region 1 is highlighted in that over 70% of all annual estimates of size at maturity measured from all depth contours and at the 20–30m depth contour since 2000, are higher than the current minimum legal size limit of 105 mm (
