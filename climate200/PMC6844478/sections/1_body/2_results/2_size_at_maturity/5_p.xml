<p>Comparison of estimates of size maturity between regions indicate pronounced north to south spatial variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). For lobsters sampled at all depths in region 1, size at maturity averaged 110.5±2.2 mm CL (range: 82.1–136.7 mm CL) between 1991 and 2015 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Spatial trends in size at maturity were similar for lobsters sampled at the 20–30m depth contour, averaging 107.7±2.1 mm CL (range: 88.4–122.9 mm CL) between 1991 and 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) in region 1, and 94.3±0.7 mm CL (range: 87.2–103.4 mm CL) in region 5 over the same period (
