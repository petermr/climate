<p>Region 5 comprises a large proportion of the Southern Zone management area, where the minimum legal size limit is lower than in the Northern Zone, and has remained constant over the period of our study (98.5 mm CL). Since 1991, over 80% of all estimates of size at maturity measured from lobsters sampled at all depth contours and at the 20–30m depth contour have been lower than the minimum legal size limit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). However, the increases in size at maturity recorded in this region since 1991 now result in all estimates of size at maturity in the last 10 years being within ± 7.7% of the minimum legal size limit, with size at maturity estimates since 2010 among the highest on record.
