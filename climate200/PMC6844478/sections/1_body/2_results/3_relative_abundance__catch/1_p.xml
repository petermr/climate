<p>Catch per unit effort (CPUE), a measure of the relative abundance of legal-size Southern Rock Lobster, generally declined across the fishery since 1991 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Since 1991, CPUE measured from all depth contours targeted by fishing operations declined significantly in regions 1–4 (ANOVA results: F = 13.5–38.8, p≤0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>) at a rate ranging between 0.02±0.004 kg/potlift per year (region 4)(

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In region 5, no significant trend in CPUE was evident likely due to a period of historically high levels of CPUE recorded between 1999 and 2006 (ANOVA: F = 0.33, p = 0.57) (
