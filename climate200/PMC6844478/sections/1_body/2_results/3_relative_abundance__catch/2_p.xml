<p>Temporal trends in CPUE of Southern Rock Lobster caught at the 20–30m depth contour resembled those measured from all depth contours in each region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Significant declines in CPUE were recorded at 20–30m in regions 1–4 (ANOVA: regions 1–4, F = 11.1–49.3, all p ≤0.05). In all regions, annual estimates of CPUE recorded from relatively shallow inshore areas of 20–30m depth were slightly lower than estimates of CPUE measured from all depth contours. Differences were most pronounced in regions 1, 4 and 5, where annual estimates of CPUE measured at the 20–30m depth contour were an average of 5.1 (region 1) to 8.6% (region 4) less than annual estimates of CPUE measured from all depth contours fished in each region (
