<p>Analyses of temporal trends in fishing depth indicated that fishing operations in all five regions have moved from deeper offshore areas to shallower inshore areas since 1991 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g002">Fig 2A–2E</xref>). Between the period 1991–98 and 2008–15, decreases in the average depth of fishing operations were recorded in nearly all Marine Fishing Areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225144.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Changes in the depth of fishing operations of greater than 15% were recorded in Marine Fishing Areas 6 and 18 (region 1), Marine Fishing Area 27 (region 2), Marine Fishing Area 38 (region 3), Marine Fishing Area 51 (region 4) and Marine Fishing Area 58 (region 5) (
