<p>Annual anomalies in sea-surface temperature measured relative to the average sea-surface temperature recorded between 1992 and 2015 indicate that the increasing trends in sea-surface temperature in each region in South Australia are largely a result of higher than average sea-surface temperatures (positive anomalies) recorded in the last 10 years. Since 2006, positive sea-surface temperature anomalies have been recorded in each region in at least seven years. Mapping of sea-surface temperature anomalies in 2012 indicate sea-surface temperatures in each region 0.84–1.06°C above the 1992–2015 average with positive annual sea-surface temperature anomalies widespread across regions 3–5 (
