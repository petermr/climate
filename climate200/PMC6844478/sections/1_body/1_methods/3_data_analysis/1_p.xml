<p>Previous research in the Southern Zone of the South Australian Rock Lobster Fishery identified a negative relationship between size at maturity and depth [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since 1993, fishing operations in the Southern Zone have also contracted inshore following the introduction of quota [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We considered that temporal analyses of size at maturity across the fishery could potentially be confounded by sampling biases associated with changes in water temperature linked to the movement of fishing operations inshore. To assess the need for our size at maturity analyses to account for temporal changes in fishing depth over time, we analysed data collected from the commercial logbook program since 1991 using linear regression in OriginPro®, with year as the dependent variable, to assess trends in the average depth of fishing in regions 1–5. To map the extent of any change in depth of fishing since 1991, we analysed the average percentage change in the depth of fishing operations in each Marine Fishing Area in two 8-year periods: 1991–1998 and 2008–2015.
