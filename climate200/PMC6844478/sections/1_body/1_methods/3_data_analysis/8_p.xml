<p>Available sea-surface temperature data were collated for each region (1–5) between 1992 and 2015 from a one month average of all the highest available quality values that overlapped with cells of 0.02 degree x 0.02 degree resolution over the study area bounding 128.64°E to 141.09°E, 30.96°S to 38.61°S. All sea-surface temperature data were weighted by the area of overlap [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Two approaches were used to assess temporal and spatial trends in sea-surface temperature in regions 1 to 5 between 1992 and 2015. Firstly, we estimated annual averages of sea-surface temperature recorded for all depth contours, and at the 20–30m depth contour, in each region from 1992 and 2015, and tested for significance of increase or decrease of sea-surface temperature in each region over time using linear regression and ANOVA in OriginPro® (p&lt;0.05), with year as the dependent variable. Secondly, for each region, we estimated annual sea-surface temperature anomalies at the 20-30m depth contour by subtracting the mean annual sea-surface temperature from the mean sea-surface temperature calculated over the study period (1992–2015). Annual sea-surface temperature anomalies were estimated for each year and region combination between 1992 and 2015, and contour maps for all regions at all depth contours were generated for two years with low and high sea-surface temperature anomalies (1994 and 2012, respectively).
