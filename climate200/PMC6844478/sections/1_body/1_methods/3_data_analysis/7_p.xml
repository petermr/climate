<p>We analysed trends in CPUE of legal-size Southern Rock Lobster since 1991 for lobsters caught at the 20–30m depth contour as well as for lobsters caught from all depth contours. For each region (1–5), significant trends in the CPUE of legal-size lobsters since 1991 were also tested for using linear regression with ANOVA in OriginPro
 <sup>®</sup> (p&lt;0.05), with year as the dependent variable.
