<p>Marine temperature data were derived from two sources. To assess temporal trends in sea-surface temperature, available data were obtained from the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) portal [
 <xref rid="pone.0225144.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] for each fishing season period (1 October to 31 May) between 1992 and 2015. Data downloaded from IMOS are obtained from an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument onboard the NOAA 19 polar-orbiting satellite. Temporal trends in bottom temperature data were obtained from loggers deployed in two regions of the study area (

In region 3, bottom temperature data were collected from an IMOS mooring deployed at 100m off western Kangaroo Island between 2008 and 2016. The mooring forms part of the IMOS series of National Reference Stations (IMOS platform code: NRSAKAI) that are deployed to monitor ocean climate in Australian coastal ocean waters. Time-series measures of temperature at 100 m depth were collected using FSI/Teledyne Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) instruments each sampling for 15 s at 2 Hz. In region 5, bottom temperature data were collected from onset® StowAway®TidbiT® TBI32-05+37 bottom loggers, with an accuracy of ±0.2° at 20°C and a response time of 60 min, deployed at 60m depth at Southend, Robe and Port MacDonnell between 1998 and 2016 (
