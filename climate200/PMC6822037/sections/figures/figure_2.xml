  <p>Global warming increases the vulnerability of tree species under drought conditions in different ways. For some species, high temperatures induce the reduction in stomatal conductance (
   <italic>g</italic>
   <sub>s</sub>), reducing leaf transpiration and increasing leaf temperature, which may lead to deeper reductions in photosynthesis (
   <italic>A</italic>) and increases in photorespiration (
   <italic>P</italic>
   <sub>R</sub>) and respiration (
   <italic>R</italic>) rates, further intensifying the negative carbon balance induced by drought. For other species, high temperatures increase the stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration, further increasing the tension in xylem vessels induced by drought, leading to higher vulnerability to cavitation and hydraulic failure
