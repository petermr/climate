  <p>Main physiological disorders induced by drought (DH), flooding (FL), and heat stress (HT) which may reduce plant performance and survival under a climate change scenario. Overall, tree dieback events are mainly related to impairments in water transport and/or carbon balance. Reductions in water transport capacity are associated with hydraulic failure (as a consequence of xylem cavitation) and damages to the root system (reduced expression and activity of aquaporins as well as alterations in root morphology and growth). Conversely, negative carbon balance can be triggered by reductions in photosynthesis (
   <italic>A</italic>), as a result of diffusive (lower stomatal (
   <italic>g</italic>
   <sub>s</sub>) and mesophyll (
   <italic>g</italic>
   <sub>m</sub>) conductance) and biochemical (damages to membranes and enzymes) limitations, in addition to increases in respiration (
   <italic>R</italic>) and photorespiration (
   <italic>P</italic>
   <sub>R</sub>) rates
