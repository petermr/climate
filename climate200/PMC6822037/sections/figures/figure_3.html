 <caption> The controversial role of CO 2. High [CO 2] can stimulate plant growth through the increase in CO 2/O 2 ratio inside the chloroplasts, which enhance photosynthesis ( A) and reduce photorespiration ( P R), besides contributing to the increase in water use efficiency (WUE), as a result of reduced stomatal conductance ( g s), thus minimizing the deleterious effect of some abiotic stresses. On the other hand, the fertilizer effect of high [CO 2] is not always observed or only transitory, as a result of the downregulation of A, which is related to carbohydrate accumulation, repression of photosynthetic genes, and lower availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Moreover, some morphological and morpho‚Äêanatomical changes induced by high [CO 2] may also enhance the vulnerability of tree species to abiotic stresses, as a result of increased transpiration, reduced water uptake, increased vulnerability to cavitation, and higher respiration ( R) and photorespiration ( P R) rates. High [CO 2] can also compromise the interactions between plants and their pollinators, through phenology changes </caption>
