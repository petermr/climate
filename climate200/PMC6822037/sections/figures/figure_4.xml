  <p>Climate change can induce profound transformations in forest ecosystems worldwide (a). The increase in frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events can trigger massive tree mortality, affect species recruitment (due to alterations in germination, establishment, and early seedling survival), and reduce fertility and/or change the phenology of several species (b), resulting in deep changes in species distribution and forest composition (c). This massive loss of biodiversity can reduce the resilience of several forest ecosystems, making them even more sensitive to the effects of climate change (d). Even when the extreme weather does not induce tree mortality, the reduction in carbon assimilation and the increase in carbon release, due to reduced performance, can transform the forest ecosystem from carbon sinks to carbon sources, further increasing the atmospheric [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] (e), and thus the rate of climate change itself (e). This further increase in [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] can have contrasting effects, depending on the environmental context in which tree species are inserted. For several regions, the increase in [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] can enhance the deleterious effect of drought and high temperature (see also Figure 
   <xref rid="ece35663-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which may place species in a condition that exceeds their physiological limits, resulting in even more mortality events (d). Contradictorily, for other regions, the changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to more favorable conditions to some species, which may result in an increase in performance and biodiversity on those regions (f)
