<p>Temperature and water availability are two of the main determinants of the establishment, distribution, and survival of plant species around the world (Anderegg &amp; Hillerislambers,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0228" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Thus, if climate model predictions are confirmed, the higher incidence, duration, and intensity of extreme weather can prompt profound changes in several plant communities, resulting in massive forest dieback, which can culminate in massive losses in biodiversity (Choat et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Wiens, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0242" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In fact, some studies report that climate change can trigger the replacement of several species from some biomes by those that are better adapted to extreme weather events. In tropical regions, for example, the occurrence of extreme weather events can lead to the replacement of the Amazon forest by Savannah vegetation (Lapola, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). A similar scenario of changes in species composition is also expected for several other vegetation types, such as grasslands, temperate, boreal, and Mediterranean forests (Barros, Thuiller, &amp; Münkemüller, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Boulanger et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Brusca et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0254" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, it is important to emphasize that despite the fact that these extreme weather events are expected to intensify in the upcoming decades, their deleterious effects are already being observed. Indeed, a growing body of evidence associates the increasing death of forest species with water (drought and flood) and heat stresses (Allen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0243" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Observations of these widespread mortality events associated with extreme weather conditions have been documented on plants from all functional types, from all biomes around the world (McDowell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0156" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). These observations become even more alarming when we take into account the proportion of plant species that may become extinct as a result of the intensification of such stresses (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Urban,
