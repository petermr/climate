<p>Over the last decades, anthropogenic activities such as uncontrolled deforestation and increasing greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in a series of environmental imbalances that have caused significant changes in complex climate dynamics around the world. Examples of these changes include increases in the atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] as well as the global average temperature (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In addition to the changes already observed, several climate models predict an intensification of these factors in the ensuing decades, which may result in a higher incidence of extreme weather events (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0252" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). According to these models, drastic reductions in rainfall are expected for some regions, whereas greater rainfall volumes are expected for others, resulting in more frequent and intense drought and flood events, respectively (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In addition to the changes in pluviosity patterns, alterations in thermic regimes are also expected in several regions worldwide, which may increase the intensity and frequency of extreme temperature events, such as heat waves and late‚Äêspring frost events (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
