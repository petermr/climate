<p>Another concern regarding the changes in forest composition is related to tree recruitment since drastic changes in weather conditions can directly affect germination, establishment, and early seedling survival (Clark et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In fact, some studies already showed a reduction in species richness due to reductions in seedling emergence and increased mortality following events of drought (Lucas‐Borja, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0141" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), especially when in association with high temperatures (Lloret &amp; Pen, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0136" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>; Lloret, Peñuelas, Prieto, Llorens, &amp; Estiarte, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0137" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). This disruption in seedling recruitment might be further intensified by the direct effect of environmental variations on plant reproduction, both due to reductions in fecundity (Saavedra, Inouye, Price, &amp; Harte, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0195" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Su et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0221" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) and/or for mismatches between plants and their pollinators (as discussed above for high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]) (Figure
