<p>Finally, it is important to highlight that, for some forest communities, the changes in climatic conditions can have a positive effect on plant biodiversity (Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Hisano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35663-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f). For example, the increase in atmospheric temperature, in association with higher [CO
 <sub>2</sub>], can have a positive effect for many species (Rodrigues et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0190" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Roy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0193" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Similarly, the increase in precipitation, predicted for some regions (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), can also have a positive effect on threatened species, resulting in an increase in biomass production on those forest communities (Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, these results should be analyzed with care, since this controversial beneficial effect of climate change has been observed only on a small fraction of the vast literature that covers the impact of extreme weather events on plant function and composition. All these uncertainties add new layers of complexity to the already puzzling task of predicting the impact of climate change on the composition of forest communities worldwide.
