<p>Finally, another factor that can increase the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in a scenario of reduced precipitation is the increase in the frequency and intensity of fire events. In fact, due to the increase in litter production and reduction in biomass humidity (Collins, Bennett, Leonard, &amp; Penman, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Duursma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), the effect of drought on vegetation can significantly increase the fire spread and intensity, even in those regions that would be unlike to be burned (e.g., mesic sites and poleward‐facing slopes; Collins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Krawchuk et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Leonard, Bennett, &amp; Clarke, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It is important to note that although plants may have a set of traits and strategies to allow them to survive fire episodes and/or recompose burned areas (Hoffmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Pellegrini, Franco, &amp; Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0180" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Schafer, Breslow, Hohmann, &amp; Hoffmann, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0202" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), the increase in drought intensity can significantly reduce the resilience of tree species from fire‐prone habitats (Pratt, Jacobsen, Ramirez, &amp; Helms, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0184" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Some studies already showed that the negative impact of drought on seed germination and seedling survival can drastically reduce the postfire regeneration of subalpine species (Harvey, Donato, &amp; Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), which may lead to a shift toward more drought‐tolerant species (Moser, Temperli, Schneiter, &amp; Wohlgemuth, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0162" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In addition to the negative impact on seedling recruitment, drought can also affect the regeneration of burned areas thought the increase in the vulnerability of resprouting plants (Pratt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0184" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In fact, although it was already shown that resprouting species often display a better water status in the months after the crown fire (probably due to reduced leaf area and thus higher root‐to‐shoot ratio; Clemente, Rego, &amp; Correia, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Ramirez, Pratt, Jacobsen, &amp; Davis, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0186" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Refsland &amp; Fraterrigo, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0187" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Schwilk, Brown, Lackey, &amp; Willms, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0207" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), they tend to be more vulnerable to drought than co‐occurring unburned plants (Ramirez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0186" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Saruwatari &amp; Davis, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0200" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). An example of the higher vulnerability of resprouting plants is the well‐documented increase in mortality rates of shrub species from a chaparral community when intense drought occurred in the following year after a fire event (Pratt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0184" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). This increase in postfire mortality is commonly attributed to a reduction in cavitation resistance (Jacobsen, Tobin, Toschi, Percolla, &amp; Pratt, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0107" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Pratt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0184" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) and probably is also linked to a depletion in carbohydrate reserves of the resprouting plants (McDowell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0156" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Thus, the increase in drought frequency, intensity, and duration has the potential to not only change the dynamics of fire regimes (Clarke, Knox, Bradstock, Munoz‐Robles, &amp; Kumar, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Littell, Peterson, Riley, Liu, &amp; Luce, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>), putting in risk fire‐sensitive species from regions which were unlike to be burned, but can also increase the vulnerability from fire‐tolerant species, resulting in drastic changes in forest composition and loss of biodiversity (Henzler, Weise, Enright, Zander, &amp; Tietjen, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>).
