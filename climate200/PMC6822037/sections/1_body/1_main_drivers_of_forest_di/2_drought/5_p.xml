<p>In addition to a higher tolerance against cavitation, the efficient control of water loss also represents a central component of the tree survival under drought. In fact, a recent study has shown that most of the species tend to close their stomata before the onset of the cavitation events (Martin‚ÄêStPaul, Delzon, &amp; Cochard, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0148" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Nevertheless, even after the complete stomatal closure, the plants keep losing water to the atmosphere through their cuticle (Bueno et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). This residual transpiration (

 <sub>min</sub>) varies widely across species and functional groups (Schuster, Burghardt, &amp; Riederer, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0206" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and can directly affect the time to HF (Cochard, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). However, although

 <sub>min</sub> has been recently pointed as a central component of the drought tolerance strategy (Cochard, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), several questions regarding this trait remain. For example, what are the main determinants of the variability of

 <sub>min</sub> across species? Is there a coordination between 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>min</sub> and vulnerability to cavitation? To which extent do plants are able to adjust this trait through drought acclimation? The lack of consensus regarding the answers to these questions highlights an important gap in our understanding of the strategies of water conservation, both within and across tree species. Thus, in order to better predict the impact of drought on forest communities, it is essential to unravel the uncertainties about

 <sub>min</sub> and also to widespread the integration of this trait on climate change models.
