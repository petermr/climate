<p>In addition to intensity and duration, the frequency of drought events appears to be a predominant factor in forest dieback events, yet it is rarely taken into account in climate models. In fact, few studies to date have focused on the behavior of plants subjected to cyclical drought episodes, even though this is a more common situation than isolated events (Menezes‚ÄêSilva et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0158" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Recent studies have also shown that after exposure to severe drought, years may be required for several plant communities to fully recover their physiological processes (e.g., growth rates), making them even more vulnerable to further drought episodes (Anderegg, Schwalm, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Evidence of this reduced ability to fully recover after severe drought events can be observed in plants from contrasting vegetation types, such as the temperate and continental forests (Gazol et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Thus, an increase in the frequency of drought events can significantly impair the composition of several biomes around the world. Therefore, in addition to a better understanding of the factors associated with reduced performance under drought conditions, it is vital to increase our knowledge about how plants recover from these extreme climatic events.
