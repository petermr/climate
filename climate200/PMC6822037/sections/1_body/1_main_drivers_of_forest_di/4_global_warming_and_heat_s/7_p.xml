<p>The effects of global warming are expressed not only through the increase in the occurrence of extremely high temperatures (e.g., heat waves), but also with more subtle changes, as the increase in winter temperatures. In fact, in the last century, an expressive increase in mean winter temperatures was observed in some regions (e.g., northern Europe; Mikkonen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0159" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). However, although the occurrence of extremely low temperatures is expected to decrease in the decades to come (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), paradoxically, the global warming will probably increase the vulnerability of plant species to frost‐induced injury, especially those from temperate regions (Augspurger, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Príncipe et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0185" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). The process of cold acclimation is triggered by the reduction in temperatures and photoperiod and involves a marvelous set of biochemical adjustments (e.g., accumulation of soluble sugars, hydrophilic proteins, antioxidants, and chaperones) that confers cryoprotection to the cells (Basler &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In early spring, as the temperature rises, the resistance to frost injury decreases progressively, reaching a minimum when new leaves emerge, making the plants extremely vulnerable to a “late‐spring” frost event (Lenz, Hoch, Vitasse, &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0126" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Vitasse, Lenz, Hoch, &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0235" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Vitasse, Schneider, Rixen, Christen, &amp; Rebetez, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0236" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Some studies already showed that these frost damages are related to a previous warm period, which induces precocious spring phenology (Vitasse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0236" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In this way, the phenological changes induced by the combination of warmer springs and large temperature fluctuations, predicted for the decades to come (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), may significantly increase the vulnerability to frost in several tree species (Augspurger, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Julio Camarero, Gazol, Sancho‐Benages, &amp; Sangüesa‐Barreda, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0112" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The occurrence of frost‐induced mortality events, especially those related to late‐spring frost, is considerably growing in some regions and is expected to be more frequent as the atmospheric temperature keeps changing (Augspurger, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Moreover, it is important to note that these events of frost mortality are observed not only in temperate regions, but also in tropical forests. In a recent study, it was shown that a widespread mortality event in a tropical dry forest from Mexico was related to an unusual combination of duration, intensity, and timing of a frost event (Bojórquez, Álvarez‐Yépiz, Búrquez, &amp; Martínez‐Yrízar, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Similarly, dieback events related to frost injury were also reported for species from the Mediterranean region (Jalili et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0109" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Matusick, Ruthrof, Brouwers, &amp; Hardy, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0149" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). These examples illustrate well the impact of global warming on the vegetation, since its effects, especially the large temperature fluctuations, can significantly increase the vulnerability of forest species in virtually all biomes.
