<p>Another point that is frequently debated is the potential of high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] to mitigate the deleterious effects of certain abiotic stresses. Some studies have shown that the beneficial effects of high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] can be offset by an increase in canopy leaf area (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; McCarthy, Oren, Finzi, &amp; Johnsen, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0151" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Warren, Norby, Wullschleger, &amp; Oren, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0240" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), reductions in root depth (Duursma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), and alterations in xylem anatomical properties (e.g., increase in vessel diameter; Ceulemans, Jach, Velde, Lin, &amp; Stevens, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Such morpho‐anatomical changes induced by high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] may result in increased transpiration demand and lower capacity to absorb and transport water due to reduced hydraulic conductivity of roots (Warren et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0240" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and leaves (Domec et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and higher vulnerability to cavitation in different organs (Domec, Schäfer, Oren, Kim, &amp; McCarthy, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), exacerbating the susceptibility of plants to drought events. The same scenario of uncertainties about the mitigating effect of high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] is also observed for plants exposed to high temperatures, particularly when this stress is associated with drought (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Duan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Under these conditions, increased leaf area and reductions in transpiration rates can significantly reduce latent heat loss, which may increase leaf temperature and subsequently generate a series of disturbances that may enhance vulnerability to heat stress (e.g., increase in

 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>R</sub> rates; Voelker et al.,
