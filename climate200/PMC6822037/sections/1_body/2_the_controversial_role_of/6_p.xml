<p>Finally, another matter of concern regarding plant behavior under a scenario of increased [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] is altered regulation of specific processes related to development, particularly phenology (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Several studies have shown that changes in flowering time appear to be a common response of plants exposed to high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] (Jagadish et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0108" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Springer, Orozco, Kelly, &amp; Ward, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0216" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Springer &amp; Ward, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0217" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35663-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Such changes can have a devastating impact on the composition of several plant communities because changes in flowering time may, for instance, induce mismatches between plants and their respective pollinators and thereby compromise the reproduction and distribution of several species (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Polce et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0183" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Springer &amp; Ward, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0217" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). These results are even more worrying when we also consider the increase in global average temperature, another factor that has been directly associated with phenological changes in many species (Bock et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Legave, Gu√©don, Malagi, Yaacoubi, &amp; Bonhomme, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Mulder, Iles, &amp; Rockwell, 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0163" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Thus, it is clear that the effect of high [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] on the performance, survival, and distribution of species worldwide represents one of the greatest uncertainties related to climate change because its effects are extremely variable and also depend on a range of other factors.
