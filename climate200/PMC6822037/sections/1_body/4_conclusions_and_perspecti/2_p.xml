<p>As discussed in the previous sections, there are multiple ways by which factors associated with climate change can increase the vulnerability of, as well as place at risk of extinction, numerous forest species distributed in the most diverse biomes around the world. Given this alarming scenario of potential changes in the composition of several plant communities, it is essential that more studies seek to elucidate the factors associated with climate change that may lead to plant mortality. Furthermore, more important than characterizing the factors related to plant vulnerability to a particular stress is determining how the interaction between multiple stressors can influence the survival of such species. In situations of exposure to multiple stressors, it is also of paramount importance to better characterize the real role of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, as well as the influence of variation in nutrient availability, in the mitigation or intensification of the deleterious effects of other stressors. In this sense, free‐air CO
 <sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) and open‐top chamber (OTC) studies that simulate the concomitant occurrence of other stresses, such as drought and high temperature, are key to better characterizing the impact of climate change on plant behavior (Becklin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35663-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In addition, the use of integrative approaches from genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, as well as those techniques used to monitor physiological changes in different organs (e.g., OV and micro‐CT methods), is of pivotal importance to trace a broader picture of the main limitations to plant performance under extreme weather events. The results obtained from such studies may provide valuable information for the optimization of models to monitor and predict the impact of climate change on the survival and distribution of plant species and public policies on forest management and reforestation.
