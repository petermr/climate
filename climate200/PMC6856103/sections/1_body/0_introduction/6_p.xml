<p id="Par7">Here we explore new terrestrial PTB sections in Shanxi, North China, which confirm the environmental transition from meandering to braided rivers and the development of desert-like aeolian conditions in the earliest Triassic. The deterioration and fluctuation of the palaeoclimate are confirmed by δ
 <sup>13</sup>C, δ
 <sup>18</sup>O, and geochemical proxies of weathering intensity, while the ecological collapse is confirmed by a dramatic reduction or disappearance of dominant plants, tetrapods and invertebrates and a bloom of microbially-induced sedimentary structures (MISS)
