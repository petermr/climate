Although palaeotemperatures calculated from the main elements might be affected by local conditions and changes of sediment provenance, they may play an important role in identifying palaeoclimate fluctuations when sampling is appropriate and combined with other indicators

 </sup> though it is different from most views that indicate a rapid increase in palaeotemperature across the PTB. However, in models for the outcomes of a massive volcanic eruption, such as that of the Siberian Traps, release of massive volumes sulphur dioxide when mixed with atmospheric water may produce a transient cooling phase before the warming, driven by CO
 <sub>2</sub>, methane and water vapour. Such cooling can be localised around the volcanic source, or can spread worldwide and last for 1–2 years

 </sup>. Whether the conflicting findings of either global warming or cooling following the PTB eruptions can be explained by these differing consequences of the eruption, perhaps acting in sequence, or whether these differing temperature changes reflect latitudinal or regional regional effects cannot at this stage be determined.
