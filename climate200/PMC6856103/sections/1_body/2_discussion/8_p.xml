 </sup>? It is not purely a question of palaeogeographic or palaeoclimatic locale, as noted. The PTB sections in which massive conglomerates are absent, for example in South China, India and Antarctica lie in equatorial, subtropical arid, hot, and humid climate belts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). One hypothesis is that the fan conglomerates were there but were lost through incomplete preservation. This might apply in some sections, but it is unlikely that such massive, coarse-grained units could be entirely removed from hundreds of sections in these regions. If the mass wasting model is correct, then the enhanced erosion following stripping of vegetation and increased aridity would be expressed in different ways in different sedimentary basins. Alluvial fan progradation can occur without tectonic uplift in the source area, and in such cases the progradation is largely controlled by a decrease in subsidence rates in the basin

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>
 </sup>. However, for substantial alluvial fans to develop as a result of plant and soil stripping requires a developing imbalance between source and receiving basinal areas, with tectonic uplift of upland areas round the basin, or subsidence of the basin. Perhaps at the PTB, in the face of worldwide mass wasting, as suggested by offshore records of terrestrial sediment flux
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, those locations without conglomerates were simply in basins without surrounding mountainous source areas, or where the relative uplift-subsidence activity was inappropriate. In South China, for example, an abrupt shift in sedimentation is seen immediately following the disappearance of coal beds (beginning of the coal gap), with colour and grain-size changes in the sediments, together with indicators of a dramatic collapse of soil systems

 </sup>. Besides, most dramatic shifts of fluvial deposits are distributed in areas of similar latitude. Comparison with the distribution of modern deserts along the equatorward margins of sub-tropical basins which are climatically sensitive
