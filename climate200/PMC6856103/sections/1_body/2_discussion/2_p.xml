<p id="Par17">The negative excursion of weathering intensity proxies such as Ba/Sr, CIA, ∆W, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca support the reduced weathering in the latest Permian, especially at the fossil horizons and the PTB interval, but increasingly intense weathering in the Early Triassic. The apparent increase of Rb/K at the fossil horizons and the PTB interval indicate a brief episode of drier and more arid conditions
