<p id="Par24">In this study, the terrestrial Permian-Triassic transition in North China is well constrained by multiple lines of evidence, namely sedimentology, carbon and oxygen isotopic results, geochemical proxies, and detrital zircon ages. In the near future, more integrated work on PTB sections in North China needs to be done in order to make a high-resolution regional stratigraphic comparison at regional and global scale.</p>
