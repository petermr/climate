<p id="Par22">The distribution of climate zones near the PTB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) shows polar zones of cold, cool, and temperate humid climates, and a broad equatorial belt of tropical to subtropical semi-humid to humid climates, extending from Canada, Russia, and North China to central Africa, and the southern margin of Tethys

 </sup>, brown overbank mudstones with plant remains in the late Permian are replaced by highly oxidised red mudstones in the Early Triassic, often reworked into coarse braided river deposits. Our new evidence from North China is located at a similar latitude to the Russian red beds with PTB conglomerates, differing considerably from the successions 1200 km south, in South China.
