<p id="Par26">Fifty-seven mudstone samples were selected to conduct whole-rock major and trace element compositions analysis at the National Research Center for Geoanalysis, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing. The analysis procedure is similar to Zhai

 </sup> Major elements were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and analytical uncertainties were commonly better than 1% for all elements of these samples. Trace element concentrations were analyzed using an Agilent-7500a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Sample preparation followed usual protocols. We dissolved about 50 mg of sample powder in an equal mixture of sub-boiling distilled HF and HNO
 <sub>3</sub> in a Teflon digesting vessel (high-pressure bomb) retained on a hot-plate for 48 h. We then evaporated the dissolved sample until dry, refluxed it with 6 N HNO
 <sub>3</sub>, and re-heated it to incipient dryness. We then redissolved the samples in 2 ml of 3 N HNO
 <sub>3</sub> in high-pressure bombs for an additional 24 h to ensure complete dissolution. After digestion, we diluted the samples with Milli-Q water (18.2 mega-ohm) to a final dilution factor of 2000. We used the rock reference materials AGV-2 (US Geological Survey) and GSR-1 (National Geological Standard Rreference Materials of China) to monitor the analytical accuracy and precision. We found that analytical accuracy, as indicated by relative differences between measured and recommended values, was better than 5% for most elements. We list the calculated results of the whole rocks and trace elements used in this study in Table
