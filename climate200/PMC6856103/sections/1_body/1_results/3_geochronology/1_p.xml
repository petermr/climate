<p id="Par12">Two detrital zircons yield youngest ages of 269 ± 3 Ma and 251 ± 4 Ma respectively, from the Sunjiagou Formation (sample 2015BDSJG-1, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>) and the Liujiagou Formation (sample 2015BDLJG-1, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). They constrain the age of the Sunjiagou Formation as Guadalupian–Lopingian and the Liujiagou Formation as lowermost Triassic. Combined with previous biostratigraphic data and the mass extinction at the uppermost Sunjiagou Formation, as well as the sedimentary environmental transition from the Sunjiagou Formation to Liujiagou Formation, these dates convincingly constrain the terrestrial PTB in North China. Moreover, the detrital zircon age results from the Sunjiagou and Liujiagou formations in this study show nearly the same characteristics of age groups and peaks (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Combined with similar age populations of detrital zircons from the Late Permian-Early Triassic strata nearby

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, it is therefore compelling to infer that the Sunjiagou and Liujiagou formations in northern Shanxi, North China share the same source area, originating from the Yinshan–Yanshan Orogenic Belt and Northern Qinling Orogen.
