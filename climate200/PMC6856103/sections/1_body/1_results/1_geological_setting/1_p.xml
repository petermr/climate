<p id="Par8">Terrestrial Permian-Triassic strata are widely distributed in North China, and show similar terrestrial fluvial-lacustrine sedimentary facies through the Permian-Triassic transition, against a background of regional regression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The sedimentary succession through the Upper Permian and Lower Triassic in North China generally comprises, in ascending order, the Guadalupian-Lopingian (Middle-Late Permian) Sunjiagou, Early Triassic Liujiagou, and late Early Triassic Heshanggou formations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The age of the Sunjiagou Formation is confirmed by finds of the typical Lopingian plant 
 <italic>Ullmannia</italic> in its upper part in the Dayulin and Sugou sections (Supplementary Tables

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. The PTB is identified at a horizon about 20 m below the top of the Sunjiagou Formation by the occurrence of the 
 <italic>Lundbladispora-Aratrisporites-Taeniaesporites</italic> assemblage
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>, which represents typical earliest Triassic palynomorphs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. The PTB is confirmed by the last appearance of bioturbation (higher than the last appearance of the pareiasaur 
 <italic>Shihtienfenia</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>) and a synchronous negative excursion of δ
 <sup>13</sup>C, δ
 <sup>18</sup>O and geochemical proxies at a horizon about 15 m below the top of Sunjiagou Formation. The mixed fluvial-aeolian Liujiagou Formation is characterized by the abundance of cross-bedding and rare fossils
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Only rare species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) like the plant 
 <italic>Pleuromeia</italic> (a typical Early Triassic element
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>) were found in the upper part of the Liujiagou Formation. Moreover, a variety of MISS, most of which were formed after the mass extinction, were recognized in the Liujiagou Formation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. The late Early Triassic Heshanggou Formation mainly consists of red siltstones and mudstones with abundant and increasingly diverse trace fossils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The stratigraphy of two well-exposed outcrops in northern Shanxi Province were measured at high resolution, using the newly found pareiasaur 
 <italic>Shihtienfenia</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> assemblage in the Baode section as biostratigraphic evidence to identify the age as latest Permian.
