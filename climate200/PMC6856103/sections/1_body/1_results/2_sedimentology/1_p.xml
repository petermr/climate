<p id="Par9">Three distinct facies associations were identified. Below the PTB (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), lithostratigraphic associations in the Sunjiagou Formation are characterized by sequences of light grey greenish pebble-bearing coarse sandstones up to 25 m thick interbedded with sequences of fine sandstone and dark red mudstone up to 20 m thick. Each sandstone sequence typically overlies a sharp, undulating erosion surface cut into dark red mudstone (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Internally the sequences comprise multiple storeys bounded by low-angle erosion surfaces, often overlain by reworked dark red mudstone clasts, and thin mudstone interbeds. Storeys are composed mainly of metre to decimetre thick sets of planar–tabular and trough cross-bedded sandstone, horizontal lamination and asymmetrical ripple cross-laminated sandstone. These erosively amalgamated units of cross-bedded sandstone represent the deposits of bars within a fluvial channel or channel belt where there were multiple episodes of deposition and erosion. A predominance of point bar deposition with a meandering channel belt is suggested by the occasional preservation of upper bar deposits which show well-developed lateral accretion surfaces composed of alternating inclined beds of dark red mudstone and fine-grained sandstone with climbing ripple cross lamination or horizontal lamination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). These upper bar deposits are diagnostically important, but have a relatively low preservation potential within a fluvial belt where channel migration and reworking is rapid relative to tectonic subsidence. The dark red mudstones and thin fine-grained sandstones represent the deposits of floodplains adjacent to meandering channel belts. Calcareous nodules occasionally occur scattered or in layers within the mudstones and probably represent calcretes formed within floodplain soil horizons subject to extended periods of subaerial exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The pareiasaur 
 <italic>Shihtienfenia</italic> fossils and the PTB itself are found within floodplain deposits characterized by thick dark red mudstone or pebbly mudstone with a few calcareous nodules.
