<p id="Par10">The facies association above the PTB is dramatically different. Mudstone layers are poorly developed in the Liujiagou Formation, and there is a much higher proportion of sandstones, which shows evidence for both fluvial and aeolian depositional environments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Fluvial sandstones show trough and planar cross-bedding ranging from low-angle to high-angle. Irregular scour surfaces are common and are locally overlain by maroon mudrock clasts. The well-developed thick and coarse interchannel sequences in the lowermost Triassic Liujiagou Formation suggest an overall higher rate of sedimentation

 </sup> compared with the Sunjiagou Formation. Aeolian sandstones sharply overlie fluvial units on sand-drift surfaces

 </sup> and show characteristic sedimentary structures such as pin stripe lamination

 </sup> which may have formed on low-relief aeolian sand sheets or around the flanks of dunes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The complex lateral and vertical stacking of fluvial and aeolian facies indicates that the lowermost Triassic Liujiagou Formation was deposited in an environment where ephemeral sandy braided rivers interacted and alternated with aeolian processes. Comparable mixed fluvial-aeolian deposits have been identified in the Jurassic Tianchihe Formation of Ningwu-Jingle Basin, North China
