<p id="Par3">Surprisingly, the influence that life-history adaptations exert on species responses to climate change has only occasionally been addressed. In fact, although parity-mode transitions (from live-bearing to egg-laying) have been suggested to play a key role in accelerating extinction risks under rapid climate warming

Given that life-history traits underlie reproductive success (“fitness”), and that climate change operates as rapid natural selection on fitness via its impact on environmentally-sensitive traits, the conceptual disjoint between both dimensions creates a major gap in our understanding of biodiversity declines via anthropogenic effects. In fact, selection arising from climatic pressures have been shown to generate predictable patterns of evolution and distribution of reproductive traits (e.g., parity mode
