<p id="Par4">An emerging idea, the ‘cul-de-sac’ hypothesis, predicts that the evolution of viviparity – a key life-history adaptation believed to have facilitated the radiation of reptiles into cold climates

 </sup> – is driving reptiles to extinctions due to climate change, relative to oviparous reproducers
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Thanks in part to evolving viviparity, reptiles have successfully proliferated across extreme high elevations and latitudes, where low temperatures create strong natural selection against multiple components of fitness via thermal demands on ecological (e.g., embryo survival and development
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup> and life-history (e.g., limitations on reproductive output for viviparous species) functions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. In contrast, these pressures are relaxed in warm climates, where oviparous reptiles dominate. In viviparous squamates, embryo retention in the maternal body acts similar to an incubator to counteract the lethal effects that low and fluctuating environmental temperatures impose on egg development

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>. However, cold-climate reptiles may be approaching an evolutionary dead-end in the face of climate change
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Given that most cold-climate reptiles are viviparous

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>, that the oviparity-to-viviparity transitions are largely irreversible (thus, fundamentally unidirectional)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, and that live-bearing parity (relative to oviparity) entails high fitness costs (e.g., reduced reproductive frequency, increased pregnancy-burden, prolonged basking time)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>, the cul-de-sac hypothesis suggests that, as climate warming advances towards higher elevations and latitudes, viviparous reptiles will remain trapped in rapidly retracting cold environments
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, while oviparous species are expected to colonize previously cold sites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. As viviparous species progressively run out of suitable environments as they approach mountaintops and continental edges, populations are expected to experience demographic collapse that will lead to extinctions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. So far, evidence consistent with this hypothesis remains limited to a few studies that have approached the question in a preliminary fashion

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. However, a replicated, large-scale macroecological test assessing the responses of species to climate change as a function of life-history adaptations proposed by this hypothesis remains lacking.
