<p id="Par13">Overall, this study shows that life-history adaptations, favoured by natural selection, can turn into determinant factors pushing species to decline under contemporary climate change. Life-history traits, given their direct effects on fitness, are therefore primary candidate traits to disentangle factors that contribute to extinction, and thus must be incorporated into empirical and theoretical studies aiming to develop estimations of climate change effects on life on earth.</p>
