<p id="Par9">Compared with the current range overlap between the geographic areas covered by oviparous and viviparous species combined regardless of taxonomy (currently 15.3%), our analyses suggest that climate change-driven range shifts are likely to cause an increase in the current levels of overlap between species with both parity modes. More specifically, range overlaps are projected to increase with the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions (RCPs): while under the minimum climate change scenario (RCP 2.6), range overlap was observed to remain as today (~15% of overlap, relative to the modern 15.3%), under the maximum scenario (RCP 8.5) the predicted overlap is projected to increase up to 3%, leading to ~18% of overlap between both parity modes (Supplementary Table
