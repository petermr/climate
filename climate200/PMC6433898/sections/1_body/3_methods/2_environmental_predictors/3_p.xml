<p id="Par17">To estimate impacts of climate change on distributions of species, we employed two models of future climate conditions, the GISS-ER and the MIROC5 general circulation models for the period around 2070 (2061â€“2080). Each model consists of two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) versions representing a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6, which predicts magnitude of climatic variation for the parameters of the model) and one scenario assuming high anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (RCP8.5, which predicts the highest magnitude of climatic change for the parameters of the model) as alternative scenarios of climate change
