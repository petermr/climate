<p>Simulated climate change data on monthly scales in baseline experiments (1976 to 2005) and future experiments (2021 to 2050) were obtained from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-data distribution center (DDC) website. The future experiments were included four RCP scenarios (RCP8.5, RCP6, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6), which in the present study, we used two of the RCP scenarios, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 (with a relatively high and low future pathway). In this study, ten global climate change model outputs (France IPSL-CM5A-LR, Japan MIROC5, Canada CanESM2, USA CESM1-CAM5, Australia CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, China FIO-ESM, South Korea HadGEM2-AO, UK HadGEM2-ES, Germany MPI-ESM-MR, China bcc-csm1-1) were applied to project the future climate. ArcGIS10.2 was utilized to display and transfer Net-CDF (network common data form) files to excel. Monthly average of all variables (baseline and future) were calculated and graphed separately. Then, the above-mentioned data of the two selected groups in 10 models were compared. Furthermore, change factor method was used to select the most appropriate GCMs.</p>
