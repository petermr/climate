<p>In the present study, the software package Neuro-Solutions for Excel, version 7 (Neuro-Dimension, Inc. 3701 NW 40th Terrace, Suite 1 Gainesville, FL 32606, NeuroSolutions for Excel) was applied. The observed climate datasets in the study area were tagged as inputs and the number of cholera disease was tagged as desired in an ANNs model for training, cross-validation, and testing. MLPs algorithm was used to create a neural network model and predict cholera disease number, due to climate change. MLPs are structured of three layers of input, hidden, and output and two steps of input feed-forward network and back propagation. After randomization of the datasets, for training, cross-validation, and testing the network, 60, 15 and 25% of the inputs and outputs datasets were applied, respectively. In this study, to evaluate the prediction success, we assessed the accuracy of the estimate by using MSE, correlation coefficients (R-values), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized mean square error (NMESE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Finally, the future (2021â€“2050) trends of cholera disease were estimated under two RCP scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) using the projected climate datasets in the optimized ANNs.</p>
