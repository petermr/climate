<p>In evaluation of future trend of cholera disease, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g007">Fig 7(A)</xref> was prepared to show the trends of cholera cases for years of 2021–2050 under the two scenarios of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Also, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224813.g007">Fig 7(B)</xref> shows monthly average of cholera cases during 2021–205. Accordingly, there is an increasing trend in cholera cases under RCP8.5 by the year 2050. The seasonal trend of cholera will change in the future qua the highest cholera cases will observe in spring and summer over next 30 years, while the highest monthly average of cholera cases in baseline period was in August. These conditions will occur when social factors such as availability of health and sanitation facilities and also safe water do not either change or become worse through the time. Modeling by ANNs and sensitivity analysis of the mean of three inputs show that precipitation had the highest effect on the incidence of cholera with sensitivity of 0.54, while T
 <sub>min</sub> and T
 <sub>max</sub> had sensitivity of 0.07 and 0.018, respectively (
