<p>In the first step of analysis, GT results including gamma statistics and other relevant measures were calculated for 3 inputs and one output in five time series data (NL, 7DL, 14DL, 21DL, 30DL). Furthermore, different combinations were analyzed to assess their influence on the cholera disease modeling (

As shown in the Table, the minimum value of Gama (0.123) was observed when we used 21DL dataset with just precipitation (pr) as input combination. The best input data combination has a set of low values of gradient (0.22), standard error (0.03) and V-ratio (0.37) and selected as a best lag time for simulation in the next step. Interesting findings of the present study shows that the three input variables combination has a higher gamma statistic, compared with the other combinations.
