<p>The cause of cholera is 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic>), which is categorized as a gram-negative bacterium. Its natural habitat is brackish water. The disease is a severely contagious acute bacterial infection, which is caused by colonization and multiplication of

 <italic>cholerae</italic> inside the intestine. High risk individuals get the infection when they ingest an infective dosage of bacteria from contaminated water, vegetables and foods [

 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With growing concerns about global climate change, the role of climatic factors in cholera incidence has been investigated in the last decades. Weather conditions such as increasing ambient temperature were known as a key parameter for cholera incidence [

 <xref rid="pone.0224813.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several studies have shown a significant correlation between either high or low rainfall and incidence of cholera cases. So, either increasing or decreasing the average rainfall could lead to flood and droughts which can affect the concentration of bacteria and also human health [
