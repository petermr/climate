<p>According the results of our study, just precipitation (pr) was known as the most effective input combination which means a built model by a combination of all input variables was not suitable to estimate cholera disease. On other words, the most important weather factor was only precipitation. Wang et al., used six weather input variables to estimate the evapotranspiration and their model using the combination with four input variables (maximum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). They have shown that these variables have a better performance to estimate evapotranspiration and this model with more input variables could be developed more easily with less model complexity [

A study has reported that three contributing weather factors including daily wind speed (W), relative humidity (RH) and daily saturation vapor pressure deficit (Ed) were the best input data combination between four weather factors based on the gamma value (0.0216) [
