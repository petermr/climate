<p>One limitation of the present study was lack of long-term monitoring data on cholera and diarrhea disease especially in details of patient data such as age and sex categories and social and economic classes. Another limitation of our study was lack of hygienic, social and demographic information in the modeling process. Addition of some determinants affecting cholera such as availability to safe water, wastewater collection system, sanitation access, consumption of raw sewage in irrigation, hygiene in restaurants and other food providers and etc. can promote the potential of model to predict incidence of cholera with more accuracy. However, it may also require more effort, cost, and time. For further work, these impact factors can add to model and it may be helpful to use this approach to other waterborne infectious diseases.</p>
