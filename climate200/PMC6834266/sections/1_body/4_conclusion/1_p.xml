<p>Cholera outbreaks and diarrhea disease can be linked to climatic variables and climate change. After establishing a surveillance system and recording cholera data in Qom, the information showed that the first cholera epidemic started in July 1998 and continued over the 15 years. To project the future climate using outputs from GCMs under two scenarios of the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, we used statistical downscaling by LARS-WG as an efficient tool. Results of this study demonstrated a warmer and wetter climate pattern in our studied area by 2050. Based on the feedforward MLP type ANN technique, this study indicated that annual cholera cases will increase under both RCP scenarios during 2021â€“2050.</p>
