<p>The study has shown that agricultural activities of peasant farmers depend on rain-fed water. This suggests that agricultural activities are impacted negatively; livelihoods and food security in general are at threat. Zimbabwe is one of the most vulnerable countries and the exposure of climate change is widely exacerbated by poverty, unstable economy and limited mechanism put in place to cope effectively with the changing climate. If we are to closely look at preconditions that determine adaptive capacity, it is clear that Zimbabwe as a country is vulnerable because adaptive capacity is lacking. Adaptation strategies to climate change are supposed to be centred on the needs of peasant farmers. Peasant farmers are supposed to be encouraged to diversify to other economic activities as these strengthen household’s adaptive capacity. Other diversification activities complement each other and they ensure that food security at the household level remains good. Diversification is an important resilience tool and must be encouraged at all cost. The Zimbabwean climate change policy must recognise the applicability of IK and its value. Therefore, IK should be tapped and an inventory should be created for future use. IK indicators are useful and essential for crafting of frameworks related to climate change. The designing and implementation of adaptation activities are supposed to be based on social dimensions and perceptions of peasant farmers and not much on technical aspects. The integration of household’s perception ensures that there is an exchange of climate change information which is useful and important between donors and other stakeholders involved in the implementation of adaption projects. The study noted that there are peasant farmers who are still ignorant to climate change. Therefore, the study recommends the need of climate change campaigns informing communities about the impacts of climate change and possible adaption strategies they can carry out. Campaigns will also help to promote already adopted strategies.</p>
