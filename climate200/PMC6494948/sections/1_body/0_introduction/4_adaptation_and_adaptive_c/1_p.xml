<p>Adaptation is the process through which societies increase their ability to cope with an uncertain future, which involves taking appropriate action and making the adjustments and changes to reduce the negative impacts of the changing climate (Brazier 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The International Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report indicates that countries have the potential of reducing the impacts of climate change through effective adaptation measures (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Adaptation should be a concern to African countries as climate change impacts already have and will continue to negatively impact on needs of human beings that includes food, water and shelter. The World Bank (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) asserts that vulnerable populations and societies such as the indigenous people, elders and children in the developing world will suffer more because of climate change. Africa’s adaptive capacity to climate change is undermined by several factors that range from limited understanding of the nature and consequences of climate change, farm members’ health status (particularly in relation to human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and/or acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]), unemployment that is supposed to both complement and supplement agricultural incomes and poor rural infrastructure (Mutekwa 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Limited awareness about the nature and magnitude of climate change starts with researchers and academics. There are several climate change issues that have not yet been established with certainty that are important for agriculture, such as the time of onset of summer rainfall and the prevalence of dry spells within the rain seasons in southern Africa (Mutekwa 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It is against this background that adaptation involves changes to behaviour that includes planting of drought-resistant crops and changes to infrastructure. All stakeholders both at national and global level can contribute to climate change adaptation. Studies on adaptation point that each community has distinct levels of vulnerability and resilience and that each situation is different. Therefore, a blanket, top-down approach is not going to be successful (IIED 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The extended and complexity of climate change issues in Zimbabwe has seen organisations working together to better coordinate knowledge and helping communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change. In 2014, the Global Environmental Facility handed a grant of $3.9 million to scale-up climate change adaptation (UNDP 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In 2015, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate launched a project (scaling up adaptation in Zimbabwe), with a focus on rural livelihoods. The mentioned project seeks to scale-up climate change adaptation measures of rural communities and it targets to reduce the vulnerability of women (UNDP 2016). More to the above, Zimbabwe created the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to climate change, which seeks to improve the resilience of cities to climate change impacts and ensures climate smart urban investments (UNDP 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). National Adaptation Plan is a flexible process that builds on the country’s existing adaptation activities and helps integrate climate change into national decision-making (UNDP 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Zimbabwe’s vulnerability is related to lack of adaptive capacity and coping with additional stress posed by climate change. Adaptive capacity is typically limited by poverty, poor public and environmental health, weak institutions, lack of infrastructure and services, marginalisation from decision-making processes and planning procedures, gender inequality, lack of education and information, natural disasters, environmental degradation, reliance on rain-fed agriculture and climate-sensitive resources, and insecure tenure (IIED 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, there is need for external support from national government agencies, to poor people who possesses the lowest levels of adaptive capacity.
