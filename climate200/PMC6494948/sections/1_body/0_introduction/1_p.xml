<p>Climate change is real and its occurrence in Zimbabwe is no longer debatable. Climate change is evident, the effects and impact are being felt and threaten sustainable human development (Kurjia, Nanja &amp; Stern 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Studies have shown that climate change is a global externality that negatively impacts households and communities and that its potential to disorganise economies is real; thus, its challenge at globe, national and local levels can no longer be denied (Mashizha et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2017b</xref>; Sultan &amp; Gaetani 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Zimbabwe is already experiencing the effects of climate change, notably rainfall variability and extreme events and these conditions combined with warming trends are expected to negatively impact the economy and the livelihoods of the poor as they depend mostly on rain-fed agriculture (IIED 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that Africa will experience increased water stress, decreased yields (because of the reliance on rain-fed agriculture), increased food insecurity and malnutrition as a result of the changing climate. As such, adaptation to climate change is crucial for sustainable food security and economic development. To reduce the economic and social impact of climate change in Zimbabwe, focus has to be on adaptation to the changes that are necessary to thrive in changing climatic conditions (Chikonzi, Murwendo &amp; Simba 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Adaptation strategies assist smallholder farmers to achieve their food, income and livelihood security and it allows them to maintain livelihoods in the face of climate change. Therefore, farmers can reduce the potential damage by making tactical responses to climate change (Tabbo &amp; Amadou 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). It is in this context that this study was conducted to establish impacts of climate change and how subsistence farming communities are coping or adapting to associated climate change risks. It is vital to build adaptation capacities amongst subsistence communities to minimise the effects of climate change. This paper sought to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the impact of climate change and variability on subsistence farming communities and the adaptation strategies devised by peasant farmers in Zvimba, Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe.
