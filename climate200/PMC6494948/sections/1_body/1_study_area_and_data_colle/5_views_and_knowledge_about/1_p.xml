<p>In Zvimba District, people’s perceptions on climate change are based on the assessment of two components, that is, temperature and precipitation events experienced within the locality. It was important for the researcher to understand farmer’s perception on their local climate as it determines their adaption decisions. Changes in the local climate help’s households to make decisions at the right time to either change their practices to accommodate themselves to the changes or to otherwise to adapt. From the number of the selected respondents, 38 of those who noticed changes in climate indicated that rainfall patterns are now unpredictable and 35 indicated that there is an increase in dry spell. Interestingly, all respondents highlight that normal rainfall is becoming more frequent. The majority of respondents indicated that rain season used to begin in late October, and by Christmas time, households would be consuming green maize. However, the ongoing trend clearly shows that rain season is now beginning in early December as indicated in

With respect to temperature, peasant farmers observed that temperature is on an increasing trend, as evidenced by the high rate at which surface water sources dry up and the wilting of crops after the occurrence of a precipitation event occurs. Whilst climate change knowledge could help the farmers to be more innovative and receptive of the advice that they get from government and private institutions, the thrust is to assist the farmers to adapt to drought conditions that have always been affecting the farmers (Mutekwa
