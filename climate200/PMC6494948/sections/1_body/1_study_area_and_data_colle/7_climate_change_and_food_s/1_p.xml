<p>Respondents from the study area reported that agricultural productivity has declined. Of the respondents, 33 respondents indicated that agricultural yields have declined and this is particularly caused by unpredictable weather patterns. However, seven respondents shared a different view as they blame the government for not planning properly for farming seasons and for corrupt activities. Farming inputs are distributed late and farmers cannot plan properly because of that. In fact, this jeopardises the timing and planting date of most peasant farmers. The agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change yet it contributes immensely to the economy. Prevalence of crop pests and diseases was also reported to have increased and this poses further challenges to agriculture. The study findings show that a diverse set of crops have been abandoned and farmers now grow small quantities of other crops. Participants’ interviews with agric-extension workers in the area of study indicate that the decline in the growing of maize as a cash crop is associated with drought conditions. Although NGOs introduced mulching to reduce water loss and increase yields of maize, 11 of the selected respondents abounded the crop citing that the yields of the crop have declined over the years because of a decline in soil fertility and droughts. Scientific evidence supports peasant farmer’s views as it argues that warmer temperatures lead to phenology and shortening the growing season which contributes to a reduction in crop yield. The phenomena experienced in the study as noted and discussed suggest that food security and nutritional status of households is at threat. To strengthen food security and nutrition status of households in Zvimba, the government and other private stakeholders are supposed to initiate irrigation programmes which are sustainable and not short lived. Introducing of drip irrigation plays an important role in strengthening food security and at the same time saving water which focuses on the principles of sustainable development. This also strengthens household adaptive capacity when agriculture is negatively affected.</p>
