<p id="Par44">We assume that the construction of our models considered all the relevant climatic variables for 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> species; however, at this point we cannot discard that relevant variables for these SDMs were overlooked. Future studies on these vector species should also consider physiological data to predict species ranges. In this study, we used two approaches to assess potential suitability areas in the future. The lower risk situation is a conservative approach, because it would not overestimate but could underestimate the future potential distribution of both species. Conversely, the higher risk situation could show the opposite limitation. Furthermore, current weather observations (of 30 years as minimum) have not been compared with the baseline of the GCMs, at least for Chile, to assess which model fits better for this region. To account for this caveat, we included the results of five different GCMs for each RCP. Currently, species of the genus 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> seem to be constrained by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes mountain range to the east. In these areas, several different climates are present in short stretches of land. For example, the area from 18° to 25°S is subdivided into three types of climates: coastal desert, interior desert and high desert [
