<p id="Par37">Regarding the suitability areas shown in the model, the current potential distribution of 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> showed two main areas: one limited to semiarid areas from 27째 to 34째S, and another from 8째 to 27째S including the Atacama Desert and some areas of Peru. The first area includes most of the known distribution of this species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In the second main area, no 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> occurrences have been notified, but it is a suitable climate zone to invade according to our model. The arid diagonal of the Atacama Desert has probably prevented its colonization. Given that 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> colonized houses in this northern area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and considering that these two species have been detected coexisting under the same sylvatic environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it is plausible that 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> could be currently present but undetected or could eventually invade this area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In fact, our current potential distribution model for 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> in Chile is very similar to that recently modelled for 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> in this country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].
