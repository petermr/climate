<p id="Par36">Mean temperature of the warmest quarter is probably relevant because 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> inhabits areas with marked seasonality that affects this ectothermic species, forcing reproduction during the warm season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Temperature is related to triatomine dispersal to locate hosts and mates, and diapause induction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The maximum suitability for this variable was at 24 °C; however, under 10 °C and above 24 °C, suitability drops abruptly. The suitability maps for 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> in Chile and Peru [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] are quite similar to ours for 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic>. Temperature annual range, mean diurnal range and mean temperature of the coldest quarter also contributed to 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> model, showing similarities to the models reported for several triatomine species, including 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
