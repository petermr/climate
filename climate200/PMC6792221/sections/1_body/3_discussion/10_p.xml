<p id="Par43">The areas indicated as suitable in the current potential distribution could be inspected to evaluate if these species are currently present. However, the lack of species presences could be the result of constraints in their connectivity to present or past populations, parameter directly dependent on dispersal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>Mepraia</italic> species present adult alary polymorphism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], so their ability to surpass unsuitable areas to reach further suitable ones would be impaired, compared to other winged triatomine species. This would prevent colonization when suitable patches are not contiguous unless they are passively transported, as occurred with 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. An additional constraint to occupancy is microhabitat quality. These sylvatic species require rocky outcrops, bromeliads or rock crevices to establish, with the appropriate vertebrate feeding sources to maintain triatomine colonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. One last consideration when sampling to detect vectors in the field is the sensitivity of the used methods. Assuming detection is imperfect, areas could be determined as negative when in fact they may contain triatomines, so this should also be considered for model validation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. This was not an issue in the construction of our models, because Maxent only requires presences as input. However, occurrencesâ€™ sampling bias may have partially influenced our results, as we cannot assure that the whole accessible areas were sampled to obtain the input occurrences for this study, and we did not explicitly model the probability of sampling a location in the calibration areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Future studies should consider all these biases when projecting species distributions.
