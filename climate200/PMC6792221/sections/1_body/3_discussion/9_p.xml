<p id="Par42">A limitation of our models relates to their validation. To construct the SDMs, we used all the occurrences reported in the literature and all those provided by colleagues and the Ministry of Health; therefore, we were unable to validate them with additional independent occurrences (locations not used for modelling). Instead, we relied on the species identification accuracy, ensuring no false positive records were included as occurrences. Even though the performance of our models was evaluated by the AUC, a controversial metric for climatic niche modelling, we consider our results are relevant in terms of current and future public health risk. In addition, MESS and MOP analyses were used to minimize extrapolation errors to assess predictions [
