<p id="Par23">We performed multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS), which represents how similar a point is to a reference set of points with respect to a set of predictor variables. MESS provides an index of environmental similarity between each pixel and the median of the most dissimilar variable in M [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. We also performed mobility-oriented parity (MOP) analysis, which identifies areas of strict extrapolation and calculates environmental similarity between the calibration (M) and projection regions. MOP calculates multivariate distances from environmental variables associated with points across the projection region to a user-specified proportion of the environmental variables associated with points in the calibration region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]; in our case, we used 50%. Both MESS and MOP analyses were performed in NicheToolBox [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].
