<p id="Par18">We used climate data from WorldClim v.1.4 because it includes both current and future climate conditions (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We selected a subset of five of the 19 available climate variables within the WorldClim dataset, based on expert knowledge of the biology of these vectors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the models, we included annual trends (Bio12: annual precipitation), seasonality (Bio7: temperature annual range) and limiting or extreme environmental factors (Bio2: mean temperature diurnal range; Bio10: mean temperature of warmest quarter; Bio11: mean temperature of coldest quarter) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We used the data at 30 arc-second spatial resolution (approximately 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> at the equator).
