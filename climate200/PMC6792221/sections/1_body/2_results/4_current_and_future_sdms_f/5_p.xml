<p id="Par33">The potential higher risk situation in the distribution of 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> in the future showed some new suitable inland areas near the coast that seem to be consistent among RCP, and other potential future distribution areas further south of its known distribution by the coast. In general, the potential future distributions in the four scenarios were similar to the current potential suitable area but showed retraction in the potential areas by the coast of Peru, especially in the most pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5). In the lower risk situation, this retraction tendency in Peru was evident, even in the most optimistic scenario (RCP 2.6). An overall reduction trend of potential suitable Chilean areas was detected in all scenarios in the lower risk situation (with different magnitudes regarding RCP), showing a substantial loss of suitable areas in both countries in the most pessimistic scenario (Figs.Â
