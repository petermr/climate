<p id="Par32">For 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> in the future higher risk public health situation, the different RCPs showed similar potential distributions, maintaining most of its known distribution, but with new areas expanding this species range to the north to the arid diagonal of the Atacama Desert (between 24° and 27°S) and to the south (
 <italic>c.</italic>36°S), with some retraction in the coast of Peru. On the other hand, the lower risk situation showed a retraction of potential suitable areas, with higher losses in the 6.0 scenario (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Retraction occurred to the south in all scenarios modelled, losing more areas while increasing the scenarios’ severity. The arid diagonal area appears to be a barrier to dispersion, showing retraction areas in all scenarios except for RCP 2.6. The current potential distribution in Peru was reduced in all scenarios but in different magnitudes (Figs.
