 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> was 0.0407. All probability values above or equal to that number were considered suitable areas. The current potential distribution projected for 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> (42,727 km
 <sup>2</sup>) included its known distribution but extended through the coast of Peru. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows that it is a coastal species, with some inland suitable areas, but always near the coast, ranging from 8° to 27°S.
