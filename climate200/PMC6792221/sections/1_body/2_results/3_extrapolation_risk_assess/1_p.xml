<p id="Par27">The resulting figures of MESS and MOP analyses are available in the repository, which show that there are no areas with strict extrapolation (i.e. with climate values outside the range of those in the calibration region). Both MESS and MOP for 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> showed a thin coastal band in the projection areas of Peru similar to its calibration area. In Chile, the similarity of the projection is concentrated in the north-central part of the country. For 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic>, both analyses showed more extended similar areas encompassing the Andes not including the Peruvian Amazonia. In Chile, the similarity areas showed a restriction in the northern part related to the desert, extending its distribution further south.
