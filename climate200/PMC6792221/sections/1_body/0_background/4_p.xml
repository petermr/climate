<p id="Par15">Species distribution models (SDMs) are proper tools to examine the potential geographical distribution of species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These models correlate the georeferenced occurrences of a species with environmental information (for instance, climatic information), identifying suitable areas for the survival of its populations given its niche requirements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Climate is key to understanding the geographical distribution of species at a large spatial scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Niche conservation, i.e. the tendency of species to maintain their niche requirements over space and time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], is frequently assumed in SDMs. If the niche is conserved, it is possible to project the niche requirements to other geographical regions or to other times, past or future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Under this assumption, SDMs have been extended to the study of infectious diseases and host, parasite, reservoir and/or vector modelling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, the geographical distributions of West Nile virus vectors have been modelled [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the spatial dynamics of dengue vectors and human dengue cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], among many others. Chagas disease risk has also been modelled [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as the reservoirs of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and some of its vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. SDMs are also useful to project the potential distribution under climate change conditions, which could help to identify spatial changes of infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Modelling under future climate conditions can be important for making decisions about control and disease surveillance, anticipating appropriate measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The aim of this study is to estimate the potential geographical distribution of two wild vectors of Chagas disease in Chile, 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> and 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic>, under current and future climate scenarios.
