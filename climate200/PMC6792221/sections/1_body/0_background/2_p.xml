 <italic>Mepraia gajardoi</italic> is currently detected on the northern coastal zones where the aridÂ climate is common, whilst 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> can be found in valleys in the Mediterranean-semiarid climate zones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The domestic vectorial transmission by the domestic vector 
 <italic>T. infestans</italic> was declared interrupted in 1999; however, wild vectors are still a problem in rural areas of Chile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The sylvatic 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> is very abundant in stone quarries of periurban zones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] where it feeds on wild rodents, goats, dogs, cats, rabbits and humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and several home invasion complaints are notified to the authorities every year (data requested from

 <italic>Mepraia gajardoi</italic> is abundant near seaweed collector settlements, where it preferably feeds on sea birds, marine mammals, lizards, dogs, cats and humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These situations are epidemiologically relevant, especially considering that the prevalence of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in 
 <italic>M. spinolai</italic> populations can reach up to 76.1% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and 27.0% for 
 <italic>M. gajardoi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Under this scenario, it is necessary to explore potential areas where these species can be detected, increasing information on habitat preferences, niche requirements and geographical distributions.
