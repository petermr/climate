<p id="Par28">Our results are an important first demonstration that, at least in a range of bird species, adaptive phenological responses may partially alleviate negative fitness effects of changing climate. Further work is needed to quantify the extent of such buffering and to broaden the taxonomic scope to determine if this conclusion also applies to species already encountering higher extinction risk for reasons unrelated to climate. The PRC(S) datasets that we assembled should stimulate research on the resilience of animal populations in the face of global change and contribute to a better predictive framework to assist future conservation management actions.</p>
