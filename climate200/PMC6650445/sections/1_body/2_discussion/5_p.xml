  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, our datasets are heavily biased towards studies from the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the majority of the phenological traits in our datasets focus on early season (spring) events. Previous research has shown that early season phenological responses, especially at northern latitudes, are advancing with warming temperatures

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>, and therefore an advancement of phenological events was our main working assumption. Although the majority of phenological events is reported to advance, delays with warming temperatures have also been recorded

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>. For example, delay in emergence from hibernation of Columbian ground squirrels was associated with lower fitness, and thus was maladaptive

 </sup>. Similarly, in our study, the majority of maladaptive responses occurred when selection acted in the direction of earlier phenological events, but observed phenological events were delayed over the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). However, whether such delays are generally maladaptive across hemispheres and seasons is unknown. We believe that our proposed framework (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) will facilitate answering such questions in the future.
