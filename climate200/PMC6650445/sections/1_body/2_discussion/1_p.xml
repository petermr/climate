 </sup>. Our study thus makes an important contribution by focusing on the temporal dimension of species responses to changing environments. We demonstrate that some bird species analysed here seem to respond to warming temperatures by adaptive advancement of their phenology, emphasizing the possibility of species tracking their thermal niches in situ, which can occur with or without shifts in geographic ranges

 </sup>. However, we did not find evidence for adaptive change in all species, and even populations undergoing adaptive change may do so at a pace that does not guarantee their persistence. We further document variation among fitness components in the strength of selection, with the strongest negative selection stemming from individual variation in recruitment, followed by selection from variation in reproduction and survival. Such strongest selection acting via recruitment and reproduction may point to a mechanism underlying adaptive phenological responses in birds, which is the synchrony of breeding with the availability of resources
