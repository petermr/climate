<p id="Par8">Our literature search focused on studies that investigated how change in temperature, precipitation or both affects morphological or phenological traits in arachnids, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds or mammals. To assess all three conditions necessary for inferring adaptive responses to climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we selected publications reporting the following data from natural populations during at least 6 years: (1) annual values of a climatic variable, (2) annual mean values (+SE) of a phenotypic trait at the population level and (3) annual linear selection differentials measured on the trait(s). Annual linear selection differentials were measured as the slope of relative fitness on standardized trait values
