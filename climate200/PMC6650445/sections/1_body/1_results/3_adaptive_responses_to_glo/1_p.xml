<p id="Par11">We generally expected that warming temperatures would be associated with an advance in phenological events, because most studies on phenology in our PRC dataset represented early season (spring) events in the Northern Hemisphere, and such events were previously shown to mainly advance with warming temperatures

 </sup>. We defined a trait change to be adaptive in response to climate if the climate-driven change in phenotype occurred in the same direction as linear selection. For example, with an increase in temperature over the years, breeding time occurs progressively earlier, with earlier breeding conferring higher fitness (Fig.Â

 </sup>. The detected adaptive responses might be due to microevolution, phenotypic plasticity or both. As we used selection differentials that were measured at the phenotypic level, we could not differentiate among these sources.
