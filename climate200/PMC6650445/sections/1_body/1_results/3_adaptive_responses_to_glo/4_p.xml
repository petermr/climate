<p id="Par14">We then performed three meta-analyses to obtain (1) the average slope of climate on years across studies, (2) the average slope of traits on climate across studies and (3) the WMSD across studies. The purpose of these meta-analyses is to provide such average values while accounting for the uncertainty associated with each estimate and for the heterogeneity stemming from variation in study design. All three meta-analyses were performed using mixed-effects models (Methods). We also refitted these models to assess whether the relationships found depended on taxon, type of morphological measure, type of phenological measure, endothermy, fitness component used to measure selection and generation length (Methods). Finally, we compared the proportion of studies showing adaptive responses (i.e. the same sign of WMSD and climate-driven trait change over time) to the proportion of studies showing maladaptive responses (i.e. WMSD and trait change over time differ in their sign) with a binomial test (Methods). We also performed a meta-analysis of the product between WMSD and the sign of the climate-driven trait change over time using a mixed-effects model (Methods).</p>
