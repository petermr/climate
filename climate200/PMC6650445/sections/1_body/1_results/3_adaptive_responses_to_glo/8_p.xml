<p id="Par18">Across studies, we found a negative WMSD (=−0.159 ± 0.061 SD
 <sup>−1</sup>) for phenological traits (LRT between the model assuming WMSD is non-zero and the one assuming it equals zero: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 6.1, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014), reflecting higher fitness for earlier-occurring biological events. We also found an indication of the variation in the strength of selection among fitness components (LRT between the model with and without fitness component as a predictor: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.8, df = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.055), with the most negative selection acting via recruitment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We did not find a significant relationship between annual linear selection differentials and years across studies (LRT for phenological traits: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.1, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.764; LRT for morphological traits: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.497, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Contrary to selection on phenology, WMSD for morphological traits on average did not differ significantly from zero across studies (WMSD = 0.044 ± 0.043 SD
 <sup>−1</sup>; LRT: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.2, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.268). We thus did not investigate temporal changes in selection for this trait category.
