<p id="Par12">We conducted separate analyses for PRCS and PRC datasets and, within each of them, for temperature and precipitation. We first quantified the three conditions necessary to infer adaptive responses for each study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We assessed condition 1 (change in climate over years) with ‘model 1’. This linear mixed-effects model predicted the annual values of the climatic variable using the year (modelled as a quantitative variable), thereby estimating the slope of climate on years for each study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We assessed condition 2 (change of phenotypic traits with the climatic variable) with ‘model 2’. This linear mixed-effects model predicted the mean annual standardized population trait values using the climatic variable (temperature or precipitation, modelled as a quantitative variable), thereby estimating the slope of traits on climate for each study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). This model also included year as a quantitative variable to account for effects of years on phenotypic traits not mediated by climate. We assessed condition 3 (climate-driven trait changes are associated with fitness benefits) in a two-step procedure. First, we fitted ‘model 3’—a linear mixed-effects model that predicted the annual linear selection differentials (weighted by the inverse of their variances) with an intercept, thereby estimating the weighted mean of annual selection differentials (WMSDs) for each study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, see Methods for details). Second, we plotted the obtained WMSD as a function of the climate-driven trait change over time, calculated as the product of the slopes from conditions 1 and 2, that is, by

 <sub>Trait</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In this framework, a trait change qualifies as an adaptive response if both WMSD and the trait change over time have the same sign. If their signs differ, then the trait change is maladaptive. We also refitted model 3 using year as a fixed-effect (quantitative) predictor to assess a potential directional change in selection over years (Methods).
