<p id="Par10">The studies in both datasets were predominantly conducted in the Northern Hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The PRC dataset was heavily biased towards arthropods (88% of studies), with other taxa constituting only a small proportion of the studied species (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In contrast, the PRCS dataset was heavily biased towards birds (95%). We found no studies for insects and amphibians that reported annual selection data and satisfied all other inclusion criteria. Among the climatic variables used, temperature dominated both datasets (&gt;70%, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>); therefore, we focused on the effects of temperature changes in the main text and provide results for precipitation in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and Supplementary Note 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The majority of studies focused on phenological (rather than morphological) traits, with this bias being less pronounced for the PRCS dataset. The median duration of a study was 29 years in the PRCS dataset and 24 years in the PRC dataset (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).
