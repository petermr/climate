 </sup>. Fitness losses (i.e. reductions in survival or reproductive rates) can be mitigated, however, if populations respond adaptively by undergoing morphological, physiological or behavioural changes that maintain an adequate match—or at least reduce the extent of mismatch—between phenotype and environment. Such adaptive phenotypic changes—which we call ‘adaptive response’ (to climate change)—come about via phenotypic plasticity, microevolution or a combination of both, and can occur in tandem with geographic range shifts

 </sup>. Quantifying adaptive responses, or demonstrating their absence despite directional selection, is important in a biodiversity conservation context for predicting species’ abundances or distributions
