<p id="Par49">The results were qualitatively unaffected by the inclusion of abundance in the models: the rate of advancement in phenology estimated across the studies was −0.346 ± 0.102 SD per °C (LRT between the model with and without change in phenology: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 8.4, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) when including abundance and −0.335 ± 0.088 SD per °C without abundance (LRT: 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 9.19, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002; for comparison’s sake both models were fitted to a subset of studies for which abundance data were available). We also found that although abundance affects phenology, its effects were on average smaller compared to the effects of temperature (Supplementary Fig.
