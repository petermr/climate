<p id="Par44">We assessed the amount of heterogeneity among studies in our meta-analyses using commonly recommended approaches

 <sup>2</sup> and 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> (ref. 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>
 </sup>). Higgins 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> reflects the proportion of total heterogeneity due to between-study variation (i.e. random effects) and ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that heterogeneity is due to within-study variation exclusively, whereas a value of 1 indicates that heterogeneity is due to between-study variation. This metric is, therefore, comparable among different meta-analyses. 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> is a ratio showing the proportion of observed heterogeneity in relation to what would be expected under the null hypothesis of homogeneity. For example, a value of 2 means that there is twice as much variation as would be expected if no between-study variation were present (i.e. 
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 1). We found that the amount of heterogeneity differed among the two datasets and tested models, with moderate heterogeneity for models testing conditions 1 and 2 and considerable heterogeneity for models testing condition 3 (Supplementary Note
