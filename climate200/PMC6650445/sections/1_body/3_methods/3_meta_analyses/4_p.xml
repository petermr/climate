For each meta-analytic mixed-effects model, we conducted model diagnostics by inspecting whether the standardized residuals deviated from a normal distribution and whether there were any patterns in standardized residuals when regressed on the predictor. Model diagnostics were satisfactory for all models. We assessed the significance of fixed effects and intercepts with asymptotic likelihood ratio
