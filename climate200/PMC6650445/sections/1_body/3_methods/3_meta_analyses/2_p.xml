<p id="Par41">First, we assessed whether, across studies, the values of the climatic factor changed with time by using the slope of a climatic factor on year (obtained from the mixed-effects models of condition 1 for each study, see above) as response (i.e. effect size in meta-analysis terminology), and study identity and publication identity as qualitative variables defining random effects influencing the intercept. Second, to assess whether climate change was associated with trait changes across studies, we used the slope of the z-transformed trait on the climatic factor (obtained from the mixed-effects models of condition 2 while accounting for the effect of year on the trait) as response and study identity and publication identity as qualitative variables defining random effects influencing the intercept. We fitted separate models for phenological and morphological traits, because our dataset contained fewer studies of the latter compared to the former. Since morphological traits included either measures of body mass or size (e.g. wing, tarsus and skull length), we tested whether the effect of temperature depended on the type of measure by including it as a fixed-effect covariate with three levels (body mass, size and body condition index; we distinguished body condition index from the two other levels as it has elements of both of them). Analogously, we assessed whether the effect of temperature on phenology depended on the type of phenological measure used, by including it as a fixed-effect covariate with three levels, similarly to Cohen et al.

 </sup>: arrival, breeding/rearing (e.g. nesting, egg laying, birth, hatching) and development (e.g. time in a certain developmental stage, antler casting date). Third, to assess whether, across studies, traits were under positive or negative selection during the study period, we used as response the WMSD values obtained from the mixed-effect models for the first step assessing condition 3. In this model, we also used study identity and publication identity as qualitative variables defining random effects influencing the intercept. We tested whether selection depended on generation length and differed among fitness components by including these latter variables as fixed effects in the model. Generation length was extracted from the literature, mainly using the electronic database of BirdLife International. Similarly, to assess whether across studies there was a directional linear change in the annual linear selection differentials over time, we fitted a mixed-effects model using as response the slopes of the annual linear selection differentials on time (obtained with Eq. (

Finally, to assess whether responses were on average adaptive, we also ran a mixed-effects meta-analytic model using as response the product of the WMSD with the sign of the climate-driven trait change over time. We included study identity and publication identity as qualitative variables defining the random effects in this model. We fitted separate models for phenological and morphological traits to test whether both WMSD and the product of WMSD with the sign of the climate-driven trait change differed from zero.
