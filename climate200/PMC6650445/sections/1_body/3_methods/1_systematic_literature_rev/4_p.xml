<p id="Par32">The literature search returned 10,090 publications, 56 of which were retained after skimming the abstracts. Of these 56 publications, 23 contained the data necessary to assess the three conditions required to infer adaptive responses and were used for assembling the final dataset (PRCS dataset). In cases where several publications reported on the same study system (same species in the same location, measuring the same traits and selection via exactly same fitness components), we retained the publication that reported data for the longest time period. We assembled the PRCS dataset by directly extracting the data from the identified 23 publications wherever possible, or by contacting the authors to ask for the original data. Data were extracted either from tables directly or from plots by digitizing them with the help of WebPlotDigitiser or the metagear package in R

 </sup>. In the process of contacting the authors, one research group offered to share relevant unpublished data on two more species, adding two more studies to the dataset, totalling 25 publications. The PRCS dataset consisted of 71 studies containing data on annual values of climatic factors, annual phenotypic trait values and annual linear selection differentials for 17 species in 13 countries (Supplementary DataÂ
