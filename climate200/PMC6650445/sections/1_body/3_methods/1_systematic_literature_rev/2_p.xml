<p id="Par30">To assess whether trait changes were adaptive, we only used studies that measured selection on the trait(s) of interest by means of linear selection differentials

 </sup>, as the slope of the linear model, with relative fitness (individual fitness divided by mean fitness) as response and the z-transformed trait value as predictor. Only studies that reported SE estimates along with annual linear selection differentials were retained. For the majority of studies, we extracted selection differentials directly from the published studies, and for 12 studies, we calculated them ourselves using the respective individual-level data shared by the authors.
