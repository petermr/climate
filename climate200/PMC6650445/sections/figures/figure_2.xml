 <caption>
  <p>Temporal trend in temperature shown for each study in the phenotypic responses to climate with selection (PRCS) dataset. Each study is identified by the publication identity (Supplementary DataÂ 
   <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">3</xref>) and the two-letter country code. Studies are sorted by the decreasing distance of their location from the equator. Bars show 95% confidence intervals and the symbol size is proportional to the study sample size. Dotted lines extending the bars help link the labels to the respective effect sizes. The overall effect sizes calculated across studies in the PRCS dataset (including only studies with selection data, black) and the PRC dataset (including studies with and without selection data, blue) indicate temperature increase over time across studies. Source data are provided as a Source Data file
