<p>Weather changes like wind patterns, precipitation timing and intensity, increase of temperature may have an effect on the severity and frequency of air pollution. One of the effects of climate change and global warming that can threaten respiratory health is “Thunderstorm related asthma.” Thunderstorms occurring during the pollen season have been observed to induce severe asthma attacks and also deaths in pollen-allergic patients. The thunderstorm asthma of Melbourne in 2016, with the involvement of more than 9,000 persons and 10 deaths, was a major event in the Asia-Pacific region [

The thunderstorm in a pollen season led to a major rise in concentration of pollen grains, hydration and rupture of pollens by osmotic shock with release of allergen-carrying paucimicronic particles of respirable size such as starch granules and other cytoplasmic components into the atmosphere. This resulted in the inhalation of these particles by those who had seasonal allergic rhinitis to the pollen with or without comorbid asthma and resulted in the onset of asthma epidemics [
