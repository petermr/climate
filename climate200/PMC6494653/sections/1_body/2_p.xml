<p>Epidemiological and experimental studies have shed light on the relationship between various environmental factors and climate change on respiratory allergies [

 <sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO
 <sub>2</sub>), ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>), and indoor pollutants like tobacco smoke and chemicals leading to limited plant, animal and microbial life lead to immune dysfunction and impaired tolerance in humans [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Furthermore, pollen collected along high-traffic roads showed a higher allergen city and children living closer to high traffic roads has been shown to have greater symptoms of respiratory allergies. in this context, it is important to point out that air pollution can interact with allergen-carrying submicronic and paucimicronic particles derived from pollen or other part of the plants [
