<p>A global study of 9–23 million and 5–10 million annual asthma emergency room visits (ERVs) globally in 2015 was shown to be attributable to O
 <sub>3</sub> and particulate matter (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>), respectively, representing 8%–20% and 4%–9% of the annual number of global visits, respectively. Anthropogenic emissions were responsible for ∼37% and 73% of O
 <sub>3</sub> and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> impacts, respectively [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Remaining impacts were attributable to naturally occurring O
 <sub>3</sub> precursor emissions (e.g., from vegetation, lightning) and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> (e.g., dust, sea salt), though several of these sources are also influenced by humans. The largest impacts were estimated in China and India. The top 3 countries for both asthma incidence and prevalence in Asia were India, China, and Indonesia. Nearly half (48%) of estimated O
 <sub>3</sub>-attributable and over half (56%) of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>-attributable asthma ERVs were estimated in Southeast Asia (includes India), and western Pacific regions (includes China). The percentage of national pediatric asthma incidence that may be attributable to anthropogenic PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> was estimated to be 57% in India, 51% in China, and over 70% in Bangladesh.
