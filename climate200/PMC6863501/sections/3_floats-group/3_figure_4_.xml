 <caption>
  <p>Temporal haplotype network of samples from Eurasia based on 3954 bp of the mitogenome. Circles represent haplotypes and numbers represent sample sizes. (
   <italic>a</italic>) Haplotypes found in modern-day Eurasia. (
   <italic>b</italic>) Haplotypes found in the historical Scandinavian population. (
   <italic>c</italic>) Pleistocene haplotypes. Mid-latitude European samples are shown in red, Russian samples are shown in purple, whereas Scandinavian historical and modern samples are shown in dark and light blue, respectively. Empty circles represent haplotypes absent in the given time period. Haplotypes found in multiple time periods are connected with vertical lines. (Online version in colour.)
