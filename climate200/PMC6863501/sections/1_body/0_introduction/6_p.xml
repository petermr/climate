<p>Previous studies on mitochondrial DNA variation in the arctic fox have indicated a loss of unique genetic variants as the species' range contracted at the end of the last glaciation, as well as a marked loss of genetic diversity in connection with the human-induced bottleneck 100 years ago [

These studies have been based on short (less than 300 bp) DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region, and the results may thus not be representative of the overall mitogenomic diversity. However, recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have now made it possible to recover mitogenome-scale datasets from ancient specimens at a reasonably low cost and effort [
