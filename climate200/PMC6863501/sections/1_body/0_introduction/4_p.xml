<p>For Arctic species, the end of the Pleistocene was a period of dramatic shifts in habitat availability, which resulted in losses of genetic diversity and population replacements [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In general, the warming climate at the onset of the Holocene led to decreases in geographical distributions of Arctic taxa. However, it has been proposed that the underlying processes for these range contractions differed among species, either being characterized by population movements (habitat tracking; [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) or local population extinctions [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In more recent times, human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution and hunting have contributed to local population decreases and extinctions [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], including in Arctic species. Especially during the last 100 years, these have led to demographic bottlenecks and ensuing losses in genetic variation [
