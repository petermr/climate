<p>The aim of this study was to examine the consequences of both the end-Pleistocene range contraction and more recent human persecution on the mitogenome diversity in the arctic fox. A better understanding of these past processes could help refine our ability to predict the impact of ongoing changes in climate and demographic bottlenecks. To investigate these questions, we generated a temporally sampled mitogenomic dataset that spanned from the Late Pleistocene to the present day, and included samples from mid-latitude Europe, northeastern Russia and Scandinavia. Because previous results have suggested that the Late Pleistocene mid-latitude European populations did not contribute to the present-day mitochondrial DNA gene pool [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we expected to find relatively high sequence divergence between the ancient samples from mid-latitude Europe and present-day Scandinavia. By contrast, because the Scandinavian population has been proposed to originate from a postglacial expansion from Beringia [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we expected low sequence divergence (i.e. direct ancestry) between Pleistocene samples from northeastern Russia and present-day Scandinavia. Additionally, we expected that a mitogenomic dataset would permit a more accurate assessment of the loss of genetic diversity and changes in effective population size during the last 100 years, compared to previous studies on shorter mitochondrial DNA sequences.
