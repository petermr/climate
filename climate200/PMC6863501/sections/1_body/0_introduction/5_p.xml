<p>One species that both contracted in range at the end of the last glaciation and has been affected by more recent human activities is the arctic fox (
 <italic>Vulpes lagopus</italic>). The arctic fox had a wide distribution during the last glaciation [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Today, however, the arctic fox is restricted to a circumpolar distribution along the northern fringe of continental Eurasia and North America, as well as on high-latitude islands such as Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On a worldwide scale, the arctic fox is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern, but the population in Scandinavia is classified as Endangered in Regional Red List assessments. The population started declining owing to a severe demographic bottleneck at the beginning of the twentieth century [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Heavy hunting pressure fuelled by a profitable fur trade led to a decrease from several thousand to only a few hundred individuals [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Following this decline, the population has failed to recover, and the contemporary population consists of approximately 300 adult individuals [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The failure to recover could be related to the small population size, but also changes in the alpine ecosystems causing expansion of the red fox (
 <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>) as well as fading cycles of small rodents [
