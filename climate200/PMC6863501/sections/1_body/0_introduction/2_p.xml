<p>The field of conservation biology can be divided into two major paradigms [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of these, the small population paradigm, is concerned with the threats posed by small population size itself, such as genetic and demographic stochasticity. The second, termed the declining population paradigm, describes the extrinsic processes that cause small populations to become small in the first place. Ancient DNA has emerged as an increasingly popular tool to study both these paradigms. For example, the use of a temporal approach can enable quantification of changes in adaptive potential, as well as inbreeding levels and genetic load, in small populations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, the recovery of DNA from ancient remains makes it possible to sample across known past environmental changes, and consequently to identify factors that have led to population declines in wild populations [
