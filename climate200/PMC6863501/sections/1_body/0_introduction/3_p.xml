<p>The main external processes that are thought to cause population declines include overharvesting, habitat destruction, competition from invasive species, and climate change. In many species, it is likely that several of these processes have contributed to population declines, either simultaneously or one after the other. For example, the present-day population sizes in most Arctic species are likely the result of an interaction between prehistoric changes in climate and more recent anthropogenic impacts.</p>
