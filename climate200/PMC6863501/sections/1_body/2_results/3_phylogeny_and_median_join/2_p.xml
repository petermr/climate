<p>The Bayesian phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F2">figure 2</xref>) suggested that the most recent common female ancestor lived 
 <italic>ca</italic> 87 000 years BP (mean: 87 038 BP; 95% highest posterior density (HPD) = 44 571–153 339 BP). The phylogeny also revealed that all present-day, and most Late Pleistocene, mitogenome haplotypes can be divided into two separate clades with a posterior probability node support of 0.95. The split into these two clades was estimated to have occurred 
 <italic>ca</italic> 66 000 years BP (mean: 65 756 BP; 95% HPD = 33 196–122 310 BP). There was no apparent phylogeographic structure within or between the clades. Clade A included historical and modern Scandinavian, Canadian and farm arctic foxes, and Pleistocene Russian and Pleistocene western European arctic foxes. Interestingly, the mitogenomic dataset allowed us to demonstrate that historical Scandinavian and farm foxes do not share the same haplotype, meaning that free-ranging present-day foxes with the farm fox haplotype now can be conclusively assigned as having farm fox ancestry (see [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Clade B included modern and historical Scandinavian, modern Russian, Pleistocene Russian and Pleistocene western European arctic foxes (
