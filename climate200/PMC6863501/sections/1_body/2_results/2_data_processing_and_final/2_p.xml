<p>Eleven out of the 26 Pleistocene samples and 20 out of the 30 historical samples had an endogenous DNA content above 10% (electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2). Among the non-permafrost Pleistocene samples, originating from mid-latitude Europe and Russia, one-third of the samples had endogenous DNA content above 10%. The average endogenous DNA content for the Pleistocene permafrost samples was 72% (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Samples with endogenous DNA content exceeding 10% are generally considered highly suitable for whole-genome sequencing, and these results, therefore, suggest that a large proportion of our samples could be used in future studies of autosomal genetic diversity.</p>
