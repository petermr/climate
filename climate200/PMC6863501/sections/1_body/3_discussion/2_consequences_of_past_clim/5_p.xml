<p>Intriguingly, and contrary to our expectations, the Pleistocene Russian samples from Beringia were also genetically distinct from the present-day population in Scandinavia (figuresÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F4">4</xref>). It should be noted that the small sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) does not allow us to exclude that the Scandinavian population originates from the Beringian Late Pleistocene population. However, although speculative, these preliminary findings could suggest that the postglacial recolonization of Scandinavia originated from another, yet unsampled, Late Pleistocene population of arctic foxes, which in turn could also imply that a local extinction/recolonization event may have taken place in Beringia at the end of the last glaciation. This hypothesis is consistent with earlier findings of end-Pleistocene population turnover in several other Arctic taxa in Beringia [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
