<p>An alternative hypothesis is that the mid-European population did in fact recolonize the Scandinavian Peninsula during the early Holocene, when previously glaciated areas became suitable habitats, but that it subsequently went extinct later in the Holocene. Subfossil records of arctic foxes in Norway suggest a gap in the fossil record between 
 <italic>ca</italic> 9000 BP and 
 <italic>ca</italic> 5000 BP, coinciding with a warm period in the mid-Holocene. It has been hypothesized that the arctic fox disappeared from the Scandinavian Peninsula during this period, and that another recolonization event occurred around 5000 BP [

Although this scenario would also imply that the arctic foxes failed to track the climate-induced changes in habitat, it is thus uncertain whether this occurred during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition or during the subsequent Holocene warm peak. To examine this further, genetic data from postglacial Scandinavian samples that are older than 9000 BP would be needed.
