<p>The two ancient western European samples, which are approximately 12 000 years old, were not closely related to any of the modern or historical samples (figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20190212F4">4</xref>). While these two samples do not by themselves permit a comprehensive assessment of the mid-latitude European population's genetic diversity, when combined with the results from Dalén 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] they reinforce the conclusion that the mid-latitude European population did not contribute to the present-day mitochondrial diversity in the arctic fox. Together, these studies therefore support the hypothesis that the mid-latitude European arctic fox population went extinct at the end of the last glaciation, and thus that the species' range contraction was driven by local extinction events rather than postglacial habitat tracking.
