<p>In contrast to earlier studies, the recovery of a mitogenomic dataset allowed us to generate a robust phylogeny and an assessment of divergence times among lineages. This showed that the most recent female common ancestor of the arctic fox probably lived less than 100 000 BP (

 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our results also showed that the mitogenomes in present-day arctic foxes can be divided into two distinct clades, which diversified approximately 60 000 years ago. The reason for this diversification into two clades remains to be investigated, but could be related to the onset of rapid stadial-interstadial fluctuations in temperature during Marine Isotope Stage 3 [

 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Even though the large ice sheets covering much of northern Europe and North America probably were a poor habitat for arctic foxes, these animals are capable of long movements over the polar pack ice [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. They would therefore still have been able to disperse and admix throughout the circumpolar area during the Late Pleistocene [
