<p>Finding only 10 haplotypes in the pre-bottleneck population may seem relatively low, even when taking into account that further sampling probably would have revealed additional haplotypes (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Such a low number of haplotypes could be a consequence of Scandinavia being an isolated peninsula with a recent glaciation history. Populations on peninsulas generally have less genetic diversity than mainland populations [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Moreover, populations in previously glaciated regions are expected to have a reduced genetic diversity because there has not been enough time since colonization to reach mutation-drift equilibrium (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). Indeed, results from studies on other historical Scandinavian carnivore populations (pre-dating recent bottlenecks) have shown that the Scandinavian grey wolf, brown bear (

 <italic>Gulo gulo</italic>) also have relatively low levels of mitochondrial diversity [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Thus, the relatively recent colonization of the region, which started with the contraction of the Scandinavian ice sheet at the end of the last glaciation, combined with a small number of founders and comparative isolation of Scandinavia as a peninsula, could explain the low diversity of the pre-bottleneck Scandinavian arctic fox population.
