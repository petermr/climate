<p>In addition to the Pleistocene and historical samples, raw genomic data were generated from 21 modern Scandinavian samples, seven farm fox samples (from fur farms), two modern Russian samples and one modern Canadian sample (electronic supplementary material, table S3). The rationale for including farm foxes was partly that these originate from, and thus represent, wild populations in Svalbard and North America. In addition, an earlier study had found a control region haplotype shared between farm and historical Scandinavian foxes [

DNA from 20 samples was extracted at NRM using the Thermo Scientific KingFisher Cell and Tissue DNA kit, while DNA from 11 samples was extracted at the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), Trondheim, using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit. The samples were subsequently sent to Sci
