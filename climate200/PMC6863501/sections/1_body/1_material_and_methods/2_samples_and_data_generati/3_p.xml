<p>DNA extractions from the historical as well as the comparatively well-preserved permafrost Pleistocene bone and tooth samples were conducted following the protocol described in Ersmark 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The non-permafrost Pleistocene samples were extracted using a method optimized for highly degraded samples [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the skin and claw samples were extracted using a method optimized to digest keratin-rich tissues [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
