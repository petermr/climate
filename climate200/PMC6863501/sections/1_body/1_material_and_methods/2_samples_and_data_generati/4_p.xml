<p>For the ancient and historical samples, DNA libraries were constructed according to the protocol by Meyer and Kircher [
 <xref rid="RSTB20190212C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but with an additional step before the blunt-end repair. Here, the samples were incubated with the uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) enzyme to remove DNA damage that is characteristic for historical and ancient samples. The DNA libraries were subsequently amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (using 12 to 16 cycles) together with sample-specific indexing primers. To purify and simultaneously conduct a size selection of the post-amplified libraries, Agencourt AMPure XP beads were used. The concentration of each library was measured on a Bioanalyzer2100 (Agilent) and the libraries were subsequently pooled in equimolar ratios before being sent to the Science for Life Laboratories (Sci
 <italic>Life</italic>Lab) in Stockholm for paired-end shotgun sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 High Output V4 platform with a 2 Ã— 125 bp setup.
