<p>The mapped mitochondrial reads were inspected manually in G
 <sc>eneious</sc> and a BLAST-search was conducted of all reads that contributed to a mutation, in order to identify potentially falsely mapped nuclear mitochondrial segments (numts). Out of a total of 119 segregating sites, only one modern sample contained a mutation that appeared to be derived from a numt (at site 55; sample 5963; electronic supplementary material, table S3). This site was therefore deleted in all samples. Ten samples showed a heterozygote pattern within a tandem repeat region in the D-loop. All samples had equal ratios of G and C in the 13th position of the 14 bp tandem repeat. Owing to this, the tandem repeat region (252 bp) was excluded from the subsequent data analyses.
