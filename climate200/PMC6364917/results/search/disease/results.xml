 <result pre="paper and its Supporting Information files. Introduction The ecology of" exact="malaria" post="is markedly complex, involving two different replication cycles of"/>

 <result pre="especially air temperature and humidity play an important role in" exact="malaria" post="transmission through influence on mosquito abundance, development, biting rate,"/>
