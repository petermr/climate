<p>The impacts of global warming on malaria transmission, however, remain a subject of intense debate [

Moreover, several works have reported evidence for the increase in the altitude of malaria distributions in warmer years and predictions of widespread increases and geographical shifts in distribution of malaria in the highlands of Africa and South America under climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] used statistical modeling to show the opposing effects of warming climate and socio-economic development on the global distribution of malaria. While malaria risk could be limited by economic growth, changes in climate suitability in poor areas remain a big challenge for malaria control [
