<p>The goal of this study is to investigate the combinatorial impacts of climate change on malaria transmission dynamics through modifications in the: (i) sporogonic cycle of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> induced by air temperature increase, and (ii) gonotrophic cycle of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vector triggered by changes in the natural breeding habitat arising from the acclimatory responses of vegetation under elevated [CO
 <sub>2</sub>]. We hypothesize that changes in ecohydrologic fluxes induced by vegetation acclimation will affect vector habitat structure and distribution, thus influencing the vector abundance and malaria dynamics. Malaria transmission will be further complicated by air temperature change that affect moisture fluxes, life cycle of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors, and sporogonic cycle of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites. Our hypothesis is tested through the use of a lattice-based malaria model in a coastal area in Kenya, East Africa at sub-regional scales. We address the uncertainty of malaria transmission in response to climate change in this region through a meta-population and stochastic modeling approach.
