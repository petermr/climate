<p>Climate-driven hydrological changes under global warming are considered explicitly in SLIM for capturing mosquitoâ€™s habitat distribution. Specifically, SLIM is linked with an ecohydrologic modeling framework (
 <italic>Dhara</italic>, see ref [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) to incorporate the acclimatory responses of vegetation on soil moisture and breeding habitat of vectors under climate change. The 
 <italic>Dhara</italic> framework includes a well-tested canopy process model (MLCan, see refs [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]) and a benchmarked physically-based surface-subsurface flow model coupler (GCS-flow, see ref [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) designed for capturing the coupled dynamics of moisture transport on the land surface and in the below-ground systems. It incorporates vegetation acclimation to elevated [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] and the retention of moisture flow dynamics associated with microtopographic variability. This integration provides the predictive capability to capture the impacts of environmental changes on the formation and persistence of breeding habitat.
