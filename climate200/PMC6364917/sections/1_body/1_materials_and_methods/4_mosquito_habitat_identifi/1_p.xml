<p>Moisture index in a particular grid cell represents water availability that serves as breeding habitat for mosquitoes. Previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] have shown that soil moisture index implicitly combines multiple weather parameters and anthropogenic features to substantially improve malaria prediction. However, a large fraction of the breeding habitat is at scales that are not detectable by currently available topographic data. As a result, there is a probability that ponding exists in small-scale topographic depressions inside a particular non-saturated cell that hydrologic modeling at 30m Ã— 30m cannot capture. To address this scale mismatch, we incorporate the fractal structure found in topographic depressions to the estimation of moisture index. Specifically, we utilize the result that topographic depressions exist at all sizes on the landscape and follow a power-law scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We use available topographic data to find the scaling relationship of topographic depressions (see ref [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for details) in the study domain and assumed that this relationship remains unchanged at smaller scales for estimation of the moisture index. Topographic depressions and their distribution in the study area are identified using a topographic depression identification (TDI) algorithm (see details in ref [
 <xref rid="pone.0211258.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). Depressions can be merged or split as water level changes, which alter the level of the depressions. Specifically, depressions of higher level
