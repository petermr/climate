<p>Stochastic simulations are performed to investigate the uncertainty of climate change impacts on malaria transmission. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g009">Fig 9</xref> shows the comparison of malaria incidence (exposed and infected) between simulations under present [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] conditions (S0) and future climate change projections (S1, S2, and S3). Under the elevated [CO
 <sub>2</sub>] condition (S1), we find that the increase of soil moisture due to the changes in water-use efficiency of vegetation resulting in lowered evapotranspiration led to a higher habitat index for 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors. As a result, we generally observe an increasing trend of both exposed and infected cases under S1 scenarios (Δ
 <italic>E</italic> ≈ 5%, Δ
 <italic>I</italic> ≈ 4.5%).
