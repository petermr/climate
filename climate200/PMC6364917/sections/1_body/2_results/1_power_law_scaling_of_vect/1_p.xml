<p>Moisture index on the land surface is expected to control vector habitat and malaria dynamics. Characterizing distribution of moisture dynamics associated with topographic depressions is thus critical to understand the life cycle of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors and the transmission of malaria under a changing environment. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the distribution of topographic depressions and moisture index identified in the study area. We find that topographic depressions are ubiquitous and exist across many sizes in the area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004">Fig 4a</xref>, red polygons). This feature is expected to result in the heterogeneity of breeding habitat distributions and vector abundance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004">Fig 4b</xref> shows the exceedance probability on a log-log scale for the surface area 
 <italic>A</italic> of topographic depressions found at four different levels in the study area. We fit least square linear regression lines to these distributions at each level (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.93−0.96). The results show that the probability distribution approximates the power law fits 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>X</italic> ≥ 
 <italic>x</italic>) ∝ 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>−
  <italic>α</italic>
 </sup> with slope 
 <italic>α</italic> ranging from -2.26 to -2.06. Here, the slope 
 <italic>α</italic> also represents the likelihood of having smaller size topographic depressions that are below the resolution observed by topographic data in the area. Water and material accumulated in these depressions provide potential habitat for mosquito’s breeding, thus affecting vector population. The mean 
 <italic>α</italic> is used for moisture index estimation in the SLIM model (see details in ref [
