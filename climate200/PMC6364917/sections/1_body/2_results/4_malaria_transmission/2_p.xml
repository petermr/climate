<p>The dynamics of malaria in host and mosquito populations in the study area are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g008">Fig 8</xref>. The results show that, similar to the vector population, the variation of malaria incidence, including both exposed and infected cases, in the region is sensitive to climatic factors as it is directly dependent on vector density. The transmission of malaria in the study region is year-round. The largest values of exposed human cases (

  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub>) are usually found after the start of the rainy season and when air temperature is high. The peaks of 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub> are also followed after several days by the largest values of infected human cases (

 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub>, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g008">Fig 8c</xref>). During the peaks and troughs of the season, the rates of infected cases are about 2.5% and 1.0%, respectively. These results are in agreement with observations of
