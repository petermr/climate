 <caption> Estimation of power-law scaling of topographic depression. (a) Map of topographic depression (red polygons) identified from digital elevation model using TDI model [ 64]. The gray background represents hillshaded topography. (b) Scaling law relationship of topographic depressions at different ponding levels. Lines are fitted to the distributions using least square linear regression. R 2, α, β represent the coefficient of determination, intercept, and slope, respectively, for each curve. </caption>
