  <title>Schematic of SLIM model for predicting malaria dynamics under climate change.</title>
  <p>SLIM consists of two time-continuous space-discrete models (S-ELPAs and S-SEIR) that considered the nonlinear relationship between temperature and 
   <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development inside 
   <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors for estimating the EIP. SLIM is linked with an ecohydrologic modeling framework (
   <italic>Dhara</italic>) to incorporate the acclimatory responses of vegetation on soil moisture and breeding habitat of vectors under climate change. Solid arrows represent direct impacts of temperature increase on malaria. Dash arrows represent the indirect impacts of ecohydrologic acclimation under climate change on malaria.
