 <caption> Comparison of malaria incidence rate modeled by SLIM and observed data. Vertical line represents Â± standard deviation. Malaria incidence data are collected in 3 elementary schools in the area and from the Malaria Atlas Project. The high uncertainty of observed incidence in Oct 2008 comes from the variability and small sample size of the data collection. </caption>
