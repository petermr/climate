<p>Thus, we propose the preservation of two areas with high haplotype diversity, identified by ecological niche modeling in the Mexican Plateau and on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range that will have suitable climate conditions in the future (these areas are indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). Despite the apparently large number of reserves in the Mexican system of natural areas that are located in the Chihuahuan Desert, only four large biosphere reserves are well managed: Barranca de Meztitlán, Mapimí, Sierra Gorda and Tehuacán-Cuicatlán. The others fall under a different designation, and some of them are small and not actively protected.
