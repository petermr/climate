<p>Forecast showed that global warming would favor an expansion mostly in the western range for the five studied species, under the two models RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>). RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 are sets of predictions that exclusively consider the components of radiative forcing, forecasting how energy is transmitted between grids using the laws of thermodynamics, allowing to estimate dozens of environmental variables (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Moss et al., 2010</xref>). The RCP 2.6 scenario is the best case for limiting anthropogenic climate change in which global CO
 <sub>2</sub> emission peak by 2020 and decline around 2080. The RCP 8.5 scenario is the worst because it considers that emission continue to increase rapidly and by 2,100 will stabilize. This scenario is highly energy intensive continuing to grow until the century reaching approximately three times current levels. Even though the latter model is based on higher emissions projecting more elevated future temperature, the ecological modeling did not predict marked differences in range of the studied species.
