<p>Results show that ecological resistance for the majority of species is similar in present and future conditions with the exception of 
 <italic>B. trifoliolata</italic> and 
 <italic>E. aspera</italic> where the ecological resistance will increase in future conditions. Ecological resistance can reduce functional connectivity and gene flow between populations (

 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Spear et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Peterman et al., 2014</xref>) and might affect genetic structure. Likewise, lower resistance leads to higher dispersal for individuals (
