<p>For the five species, most of the populations with high genetic diversity are located in unprotected areas, with the exception of the Tehuacán Valley Biosphere Reserve, and the southernmost area of the Chihuahuan Desert (

 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for information on protected areas, their designation and their surface area). In the central area of the Chihuahuan Desert, populations with high genetic diversity lie between two protected areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>, protected area 11 Los Mármoles and 12 Sierra Gorda). In the central-eastern part of the desert there is a high diversity of populations in an area specifically protected for wild wolves, not for the biota in general (

In summary, two zones in the Chihuahuan Desert have the greatest haplotype diversity: the southern region of the Sierra Madre Oriental (between protected areas 42 Sierra Santa Marta de Abajo and 54 Zona de Restauración Ecológica del Lobo Mexicano Potrero de Zamora,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5C</xref>).
