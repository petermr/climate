<p>Understanding how future climate variation influences ecological and evolutionary processes in organisms is crucial to conservation decision-making. Furthermore, estimating genetic diversity among populations and their spatial distribution is valuable for determining their degree of vulnerability (
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Sgr√≤, Lowe &amp; Hoffmann, 2011</xref>); areas with high genetic diversity should have priority for conservation owing to is importance for building resiliency in populations (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Forester, DeChaine &amp; Bunn, 2013</xref>). Often, genetic variability has already decreased where vulnerability to changes in climate is highest, and will deteriorate further precisely in the areas where diversity may be most needed for future persistence (

Complementary approaches to the assessment of genetic variation include methods that identify the ecological resistance of populations given that data on dispersal and gene flow are essential for conserving species in fragmented landscapes (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">McRae &amp; Beier, 2007</xref>). It has been demonstrated that gene flow rates in plants vary enormously depending on the species and populations involved (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Ellstrand, 2014</xref>); moreover, the effect of gene flow might still be significant at distance of thousands of meters acting as a connecting force for local selection of populations (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Ellstrand, 2014</xref>). Thus, identifying genetic polymorphisms leading to population differentiation depending on genetic flow in populations and their connectivity in future climate scenarios will be practical for setting conservation planning (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Ellstrand &amp; Elam, 1993</xref>). An additional instrument for estimating the effect of future climate conditions on species is ecological niche-based modeling, which can provide useful ways to integrate future climate scenarios into conservation (

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Forester, DeChaine &amp; Bunn, 2013</xref>). Ecological niche and gene flow are causally interrelated with the potential for one to impact the other, thus studying both simultaneously should provide stronger predictions of future species distributions.
