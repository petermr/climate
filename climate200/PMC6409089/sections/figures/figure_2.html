 <caption> Haplotype diversity of the studied species. Landscape distributions of chloroplast haplotype polymorphism in the five species studied. (A) Berberis trifoliolata, (B) Ephedra aspera, (C) Leucophyllum laevigatum, (D) Lindleya mespiloides, (E) Setchellanthus caeruleus and (F) the average of all species. Dark gray shaded areas represent suitable areas for the distribution of each species based on the projection of ecological niche models onto future climate scenarios. Black dots represent species populations. Light gray shaded areas in (F) indicate protected natural areas. </caption>
