<p>Over the past decade, the health impacts of climate change have been keenly felt and will become even more pressing over the decade to come. There has been progress in all of the essential service areas across the core public health functions but in many ways public health has been “playing catch-up” compared to sectors with more experience in climate change planning. To meet the urgent needs of the next decade—decarbonizing the economy and creating resilience for more extreme climate conditions—the public health community must build on this progress. An updated CFES model with strong governance, implementation and dynamic adjustment activities will ensure that the public health field fulfills its potential as a highly valued and proactive partner in climate policy planning and action.</p>
