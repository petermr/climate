<p>Progress was also made in the policy development function compared to 2008, although it was more mixed. In terms of mitigation policy, co-benefits to health have attracted substantial research attention, particularly related to air pollution and active transport. However, this has not yet carried over as fully as needed in practice into communication of health benefits to the broader GHG reduction policy debate or policy choices. Regarding adaptation, the public health field is increasingly included in broader climate resilience planning efforts, but there remains a surprising shortage of evaluation studies on adaptation effectiveness (suggesting in part practitionersâ€™ limited time to document or evaluate their work). Meanwhile, our review suggests modest achievements in partnerships, with public health playing a growing role in providing needed data and indicators (e.g., on vulnerability) in multi-disciplinary teams. Public health is poised to take a substantially greater leadership in this domain. However, comparatively less progress seems to have been made in communicating climate and health messaging. Climate health literacy remains low, even among the trusted health care professional population. </p>
