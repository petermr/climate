<p>Information gathered from our review presented an opportunity to re-consider some aspects of the CFES model. As noted above, we identified several concepts emerging from the literature which are not addressed in the CFES model. Aligning the CFES model with the steps common to the adaptive risk assessment framework increasingly used in climate and health is helpful in illustrating this (

In particular, we found that three key ideas were missing from the CFES model: First, several of the essential service areas within the assessment and policy development functions overlap with the concept of governance—the institutions, arrangements, funding and mandates to accomplish policy tasks—which has become more prominent in the public health and climate change literatures over the last decade. For example, future needs identified in many of the ten essential services included fuller funding and clearer institutional arrangements. Second, implementation of public health policy and practice is implied rather than explicit in the CFES model, although actual carrying out of activities is a key aspect of both the policy development and the assurance functions. Climate change has brought increased implementation responsibilities to public health agencies (e.g., HEWS), and this is likely to continue. Third, the CFES model inadequately reflects the iterative step of dynamic adjustment, the feedback loop of adaptive learning needed to address complex problems like climate change, and essential in closing the circle from assurance back to assessment. In particular, as evaluation studies and better-quality data improve knowledge, this information will need to be fed into assessments. We propose that these three concepts—governance, implementation and adjustment—be more fully integrated into the CFES model. One way to do so would be to consider them “connector” concepts linking the three core functions.
