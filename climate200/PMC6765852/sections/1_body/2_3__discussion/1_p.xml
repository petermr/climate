<p>In this review, we found evidence of progress in terms of climate change-related public health activities and active use of specific climate and health tools in each of the ten essential services areas (summarized in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-03232-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the evidence of most substantial progress was apparent in the assessment functions of monitoring health status related to climate change hazards, and diagnosing and assessing public health challenges from climate change. In these areas, the public health field is effectively deploying and increasingly refining available tools and methods. We observed a shift from perceived need for enhanced climate-health data and data harmonization (across data sources, as well as spatially and temporally) in 2008, to having relatively robust national and international initiatives and tools to support development of data (international and local climate services, multiple health and climate-related vulnerability indices, enhanced global, national and local surveillance and monitoring). Risk assessment frameworks used in the climate and health field are now increasingly iterative, reflecting uncertainty and the complexity and dynamic nature of climate change. Among the assessment challenges going forward are working out financial sustainability and scaling-up of promising approaches, further data harmonization and refining of methods.
