<p>To achieve these aims, we carried out a “review of reviews” of research in each of the ten essential service areas. We performed a targeted search of the English-language literature published between end-2008 and end-2018 to capture developments after publication of the CDC work mentioned above. Both PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant climate and health and climate science and health literatures, respectively. Search terms were related to each of the essential services as well as terms for climate change and health. We also scanned bibliographies of recent reviews for relevant papers and agency reports. Given the large literature available, we limited inclusion in our synthesis to review papers; however, when no (or limited) reviews were available we relied upon recent non-review articles. Separately, we identified climate and health practice examples using online sources.</p>
