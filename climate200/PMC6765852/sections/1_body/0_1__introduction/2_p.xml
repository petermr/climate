<p>While the causes of climate change are global, health impacts are inherently local—they happen where people live, work, learn, play and travel. Due to geography, exposure, and sensitivity to health effects, some local populations are substantially more vulnerable than others [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, cities are often on the front-line of climate impacts due to their densely concentrated populations, the urban heat island effect which can make them substantially warmer than outlying regions, their frequent proximity to coasts and waterways, and reliance on ageing physical infrastructure networks [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Local sub-national governments in many regions have been initiators of climate change policy due to this proximity to impacts, as well as slower national-level action on climate policy in some cases [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Public planning and policy-making for climate change has appropriately focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by energy, transport, industry and land use/agriculture, often leaving public health somewhat on the margins of climate action planning [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, because the goal of much climate-adaptive policy is to protect human wellbeing at the local level where impacts occur, public health is a natural leader of adaptation efforts [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, as noted by Woodward and Samet, “the public health consequences of climate change are a critical element of the rationale for [climate] action,” making them a potential driver of GHG reductions as well [
