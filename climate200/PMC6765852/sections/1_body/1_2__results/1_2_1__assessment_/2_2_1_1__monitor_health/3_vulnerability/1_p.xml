<p>Identifying population vulnerability is a key component of assessment frameworks supporting climate change adaptation (see Investigate and Diagnose, below). Since 2008, recognition of the importance of vulnerability factors and how they differ across populations has increased; one author referred to a “new landscape of inequality” [
