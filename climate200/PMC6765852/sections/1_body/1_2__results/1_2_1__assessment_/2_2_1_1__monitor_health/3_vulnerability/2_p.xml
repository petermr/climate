<p>A decade ago, vulnerability indices for flood risk were flagged as a key tool for targeting those at greatest risk. Since that time, the literature reflects broader use of such indices. For example, the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the US CDC (based on census data for factors such as socioeconomic status and available infrastructure), has been adjusted for climate-specific risks; linkage to GIS mapping helps to visualize climate-related health risks and can be used to target emergency response [

Other hazard-specific indices and their geospatial mapping have increasingly been integrated into adaptation planning toolkits, particularly for flooding and extreme heat. A good practice example is the San Francisco health department’s heat vulnerability index (HVI), which identifies and maps six factors (socioeconomic status and isolation, air quality, urban density, lack of vegetation and being elderly) responsible for 70% of variability in risk of heat-related illness [
