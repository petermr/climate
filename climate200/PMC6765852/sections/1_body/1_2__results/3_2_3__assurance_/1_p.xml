<p>Assurance is the third phase of the core functions cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03232-f001">Figure 1</xref>); it is an implementation phase that grows out of policy development, where policies are put in to practice through regulations, programs, workforce training, and other activities. Assurance also completes the direct feedback loop through evaluation to the monitoring and diagnosis done under the assessment phase. This latter link provides the iterative opportunity for dynamic adjustmentâ€”needed for integrative, adaptive management in the complex context of climate change and human health. When integrated with the ten essential public health services from a climate-risk perspective, assurance involves: (i) enforcing laws related to climate-susceptible diseases and impacts; (ii) linking to and providing care in the context of climate hazards; (iii) assuring a competent workforce to respond to climate-related health threats; and (iv) evaluating climate health interventions.
