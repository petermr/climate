<p>Ten years ago, the challenge was seen as planning for emergency medical capacity at all levels in preparation for more frequent and intense weather-related disasters, as well as the need to strengthen mental health capacities for such crises [

There has been substantial work on the topic of delivering physical health care to populations affected by climate change, particularly in response to extreme weather events. Rataj et al. found increased burden of injuries and mental health impacts related to extreme weather events in Latin America and Asia, highlighting the need for enhanced public health infrastructure from prevention to treatment [
 <xref rid="B111-ijerph-16-03232" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Phua envisioned how national health care systems could be redesigned to respond to climate-related threats by focusing on human resources, facilities and technology and health information systems [

Balbus et al. identified five features of successful implementation of sustainable health care systems: (i) an understanding of costs and benefits of climate-sustainability; (ii) an inclusive stakeholder process; (iii) a trained workforce to implement new sustainable systems; (iv) linking sustainability and resilience; and (v) recognizing that community facilities may need to provide shelter and services to neighbors as well as patients in a crisis [

Regarding physical weather disaster preparedness, Bostonâ€™s Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital is an example of a climate-resilient health care facility built based on learning from major coastal storms, with features such as roof-based electrical systems, HVAC redundancy, and natural flood protection berms at its waterfront site [
