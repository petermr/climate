<p>Since 2008, the number of universities and schools of public health with climate change centers, or climate-related education and research missions, has increased to include most major schools of public health.

Substantial research has called for incorporating climate change into medical school curricula, though implementation challenges remain [

Cross-fertilization with other fields (such as climatology and ecology) to help understand fully the health impacts of climate change, and working with local groups and/or governments to specifically understand the risks to certain geographic areas are suggested strategies for medical work force training [

Other authors discussed the awareness of public health sector employees already engaged in climate related work; cross-disciplinary partnerships and collaboration within the medical field was stressed as a goal of many health institutions in responding to climate change, but remains in short supply in practice [
