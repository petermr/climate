<p>A decade ago, research needs included developing the relationship between climate hazards and health outcomes, forecasting of health impacts, identification of population vulnerability, and defining strategies to reduce risk, including their effectiveness and cost [

In 2009, the WHO identified five areas of research needed to protect health from climate change: (i) assessing health risks; (ii) identifying the most effective interventions; (iii) guiding health promoting mitigation and adaptation in other sectors; (iv) improving decision support with appropriate tools; and (v) estimating the costs of protecting health from climate change [

Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum carried out a scoping review to assess the evidence base in these five WHO priority research areas, finding substantial research had been conducted in the association of climate hazards and health outcomes however noting in particular a lack of intervention effectiveness studies [

Climate and health literature increased substantially over the period but lags compared to other sectors such as transportation and energy. These authors found that malnutrition, non-communicable diseases and mental health in particular were understudied, (as were impacts in low- and middle-income countries) and recommend research capacity-building particularly in the global South [
