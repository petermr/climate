<p>Data were collected in 10 100 × 100 m (1 ha) plots, covering local (1–10 km) and habitat (10–1,000 m) scales. Five of the studied plots had never been logged (hereafter unlogged plots), while the other plots experienced uncontrolled selective logging until 1955 or 1987 (hereafter early‐logged and recently logged plots, respectively). A detailed analysis of the plots and their histories can be found in Souza et al. (

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Plots were originally laid down avoiding steep slopes and water courses, and were thus physiographically similar (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In 1999–2000, all tree species with dbh ≥ 9.5 cm were tagged and identified to species level, totaling 7,979 trees, distributed in 148 species, 91 genera, and 46 botanical families. Trees were remeasured for survival, ingrowth (new trees with dbh ≥ 9.5 cm), and dbh annually from 2001 to 2009. In 2010, data on total height, stem slenderness, crown depth, wood density, specific leaf area, leaf and seed length were measured for the 66 most abundant species. Stem slenderness was the species‐specific expected tree height for a standard dbh of 15 cm and was regarded as a measure of light‐demanding ecological strategy (Poorter, Bongers, Sterck, &amp; Wöll, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Based on these multi‐trait data, (Souza, Forgiarini, Longhi, &amp; Oliveira, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) statistically identified six functional groups of tree species: Araucaria, Pioneers (fast‐growing, small‐seeded, light demanding), Large Seeded Pioneers (fast‐growing, large‐seeded, light demanding), Wind‐Dispersed Large Trees (tall trees, wind‐dispersed trees, slow growing), Large Shade Tolerants (tall trees, slow‐growing, shade‐tolerant), and Small Shade Tolerants (slow‐growing, shade‐tolerant treelets).
