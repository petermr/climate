<p>The studied forests are located in the São Francisco de Paula National Forest, Rio Grande do Sul state, Southern Brazil (29°25′S, 50°23′W). The studied forests are diversity‐rich Atlantic forests (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) and represent a floristic transition between the tropical floras of eastern South America and the temperate floras of the southern parts of the continent (Eastern Mixed Forests sensu Gonçalves &amp; Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The National Forest consists of 1,600 ha and contains most of the tree diversity present in the heavily logged and grazed region (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The forests are dominated by 
 <italic>Araucaria angustifolia</italic>, a long‐lived pioneer species that establishes in seminatural grasslands or in forest edges and multiple treefall gaps after large‐scale disturbances, but fails to regenerate underneath the closed canopy formed by angiosperms (Souza, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Climate is Köppen–Geiger type Cfb, which is humid subtropical with temperate summers with no true dry season (Alvares, Stape, Sentelhas, de Moraes Gonçalves, &amp; Sparovek, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Monthly temperatures remain under 15°C for up to 8 months of the year and mean annual rainfall is 2,252 mm. Soils are derived from volcanic rocks and altitude is ca. 900 m. Although Southern Brazil in general has not experienced significant mean temperature changes in the last century (Rosenblüth, Fuenzalida, &amp; Aceituno, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>), the annual frequency of cold nights has diminished (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The region experiences strong ENSO effects, with excess rain (including extreme floods) and temperatures during El Niño years, and droughts and cooler temperatures during La Niña years (Garreaud, Vuille, Compagnucci, &amp; Marengo, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Grimm, Ferraz, &amp; Gomes, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). Furthermore, rainfall has consistently increased in southern South America during the second half of the XXth century due to more El Niño‐dominated conditions (Haylock et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), with the greatest increases occurring in Southern Brazil (Penalba &amp; Robledo, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>).
