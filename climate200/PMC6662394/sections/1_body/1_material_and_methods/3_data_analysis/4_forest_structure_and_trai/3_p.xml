<p>We calculated the community‐level weighted means (CWM, Lavorel et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) and the Functional Dispersion index (a measure of functional diversity) of trait values using the “FD” package (Laliberté &amp; Legendre, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The Functional Diversity index is the weighted mean distance in the multidimensional trait space of individual species to the weighted centroid of all species, where weights correspond to the relative abundances of the species. It has the desirable properties of not being sensitive to outliers, considering species relative abundances, and being only weakly influenced by species richness (Laliberté &amp; Legendre,
