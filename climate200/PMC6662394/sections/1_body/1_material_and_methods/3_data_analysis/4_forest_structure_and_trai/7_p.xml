<p>The set of best models (models equally supported) were considered as those with ΔAICc ≤ 2 (Burnham &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). The residuals of the set of best models were evaluated for spatial autocorrelation using spatial correlogram of Moran's 
 <italic>I</italic> coefficients using 10 distance classes. No spatial structure was detected in the residuals (
 <italic>I</italic> = 0.00093, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.372). Before running the GLM models, multicollinearity between explanatory variables was evaluated through variance inflation factor before analysis (seven variables retained, VIF &lt; 3.0, Zuur, Ieno, &amp; Elphick, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). In order to decide whether a random term was necessary, we compared the second‐order Akaike information criterion (AICc, used for small sample sizes) between a full model using generalized least squares without a random term (i.e., containing fixed terms only) and a mixed model using plot identity (10 different 1‐ha plots) as a random intercept term (Zuur et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Both models were fit by maximizing the restricted log‐likelihood. The random effect in the mixed model accounted for the possible lack of independence of the biomass values estimated for the 20 × 20 m of plots within the 1‐ha plots. The AICc values were very close (1,285.684 and 1,285.774 for the fixed and the mixed models, respectively), and we thus discarded the mixed model since its increased complexity did not represent an improvement relative to the fixed model.
