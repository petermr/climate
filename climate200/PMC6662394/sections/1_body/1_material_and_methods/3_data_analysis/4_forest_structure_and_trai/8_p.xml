<p>For the GLMs used to evaluate the biomass drivers, variables selected using the VIF were management history (categorical), functional dispersion index, subplot basal area, subplot tree density, and the CWMs for tree height, leaf size, SLA, and wood density. The excluded variables were the CWMs for crown depth and seed size. The second‐order Akaike information criterion (AICc) was calculated using the package MuMIn (Barton, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The full model using generalized least squares without a random term (i.e., containing fixed terms only) was fit using the gls function of the nlme R package (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, &amp; Sarkar, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and the mixed model was fit using the lme function of the same package. Both models were fit with option method = “REML.” The spatial correlogram of Moran's 
 <italic>I</italic> coefficients was run using 10 distance classes and the correlog function of the pgirmess package (Giraudoux,
