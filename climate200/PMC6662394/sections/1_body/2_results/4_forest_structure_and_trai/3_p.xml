<p>During the 9‐year census interval, overall stem density did not change significantly (initial value = 1,342.4 ± 446.27/stems ha in 2000; bootstrapped 95% CI change = −0.06–2.30 stems ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, this resulted from significantly different tendencies between forest stands with different logging histories (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35289-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, ANOVA, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 21.48,

 <sup>−9</sup>). Unlogged stands showed a significant mean increment of 4.76 stems ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1 </sup>(bootstrapped 95% CI = 3.23–6.29 stems ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup>), increasing from 1,160.80 ± 127.37 stems/ha in 2000 to 1,203.6 ± 97.21 stems/ha in 2009. Stem dynamics in early‐logged stands did not differ from zero (bootstrapped 95% CI = −3.88–0.17 stems ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup>). Recently logged stands, however, showed negative stem density net change (bootstrapped 95% CI = −6.17 to −0.83 stems ha
 <sup>−1</sup> year
 <sup>−1</sup>), decreasing from a density of 1,750.00 ± 120.21 stems/ha in 2000 to 1718.50 ± 116.67 stems/ha in 2009.
