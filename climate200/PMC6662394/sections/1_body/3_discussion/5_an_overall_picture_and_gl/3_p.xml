<p>Treefall gap disturbances and trait‐mediated secondary succession in forest ecosystems are ubiquitous (Grime &amp; Pierce, ; Lohbeck et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Pickett et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>) and important for the maintenance of native plant communities (Davies et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Yet, it is likely that the response of plant communities to them depend on other disturbances like climatic change, as argued by Davies et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Although unsustainable selective logging represents a milder disturbance type than other forms of human activity (i.e., agriculture), it can lead to long‐lasting functional (Both et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and biodiversity degradation of logged populations (Chazdon, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Ter Steege, Welch, &amp; Zagt, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). In wet subtropical South America, logging altered CWMs of several traits that are important for forest productivity and functioning like SLA, wood density, and seed size (Díaz &amp; Cabido, 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Díaz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Forgiarini et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Logging reduced the overall functional diversity relative to unlogged forests, and this reduction did not show signs of recovery after more than 60 years logging operations stopped. This functional impoverishment was due to the lack of natural regeneration of ecological groups targeted by logging, mainly long‐lived pioneers that depend on large‐scale disturbance and slow growing and large‐sized Wind Dispersed Large Trees. Our results suggest that active management is therefore needed in order to restore the full functionality and ecosystem services like increased aboveground biomass accumulation in large tracts of logged subtropical mixed Atlantic forests in Southern Brazil and Argentina, since long‐lived pioneers like Araucaria and Large‐Seeded Pioneers will probably not recover their typical dominance in these forests by natural succession. We suggest the creation of planned canopy openings in order to create regeneration opportunities for the long‐lived pioneers (Peña‐Claros et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), accompanied by the direct plantation of species of this group in logged forests when surrounding seed sources are not available.
