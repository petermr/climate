<p>In an intermediate position between unlogged and recently logged stands, the dynamics of early‐logged forests seemed to be dominated by a combination of both recovery from past disturbances and increased rainfall/treefall gap dynamics. As in unlogged forests, the increased basal area and aboveground biomass of early logged forests could be partly caused by increasing CO
 <sub>2</sub> and temperature, global climatic processes that have been shown to affect forests worldwide (Lewis et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, these forests did not show any changes in tree density, and their overall structure, including sapling and pole densities, approached that of unlogged stands (Souza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Their community‐weighted leaf length and crown depths approached the levels found in unlogged forests, while their reduced CWM seed size and height, and increased crown depth and SLA indicate functional relevance of fast‐growth resource‐acquiring strategies (Forgiarini et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Grime &amp; Pierce, ; Wright et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), although SLA may not be much influential for canopy trees (Falster et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>; Wills et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The logging of Wind Dispersed Large Trees and the long‐lived pioneers probably set subtropical Atlantic forests on a successional trajectory that proceeds without these functional groups (Edwards et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35289-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Logged forests are growing with angiosperm dominance instead of the typical araucaria dominance, and lack other common taxa like

 <italic>Maytenus aquifolia</italic> (Gonçalves &amp; Souza,
