<p>Here, we evaluate the implications of future climate change on air quality and human health in China using dynamically downscaled climate and air quality modeling (North Carolina State University’s modified Community Earth System Model [CESM-NCSU] downscaled with the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality [WRF-CMAQ] model; cf. refs. 
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) combined with an epidemiological model. Details of our approach are provided in

In summary, we compare climate variables and daily air quality in the years 2006 to 2010 with future climate and air quality in the years 2046 to 2050 under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5; a scenario likely to avoid mean global warming of 3 °C relative to the preindustrial era) (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, we are able to assess both multiyear average changes between these periods as well as extreme events that occur more frequently in the modeled future. Air pollutant emissions are held constant at current levels in all model runs so that the effects of climate on pollution concentrations and mortality can be isolated.
