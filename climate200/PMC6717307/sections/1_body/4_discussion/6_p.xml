<p>This study provides quantitative assessments and important insights regarding the links between climate extremes, future air quality, and public health. Our finding that extreme weather events may be an important mechanism by which climate change will affect air quality, which provides improved understanding of the impacts as well as the underlying mechanisms, has implications for those studying climatic influence on such extreme events, for air quality modelers, and for policy makers seeking to mitigate future harms. Our results bear out the suggestion that increasingly frequent extreme events such as atmospheric stagnation and heat waves could negatively impact air quality, especially during extreme air pollution episodes. Policy makers and the public are not primarily concerned with average air quality, but with periodic episodes when air pollution is especially bad, which may have disproportionate impacts on human health, and are thus a major focus of clean air policies. For policy makers, one of the most important aspects of air quality management is therefore the mitigation of extreme air pollution episodes. If, as we find, climate change will significantly worsen such extreme pollution episodes, and thus increase risks to public health, then clean air policies will be relatively less effective, and the level of pollution management required to meet future air quality targets will be even greater than what may now be anticipated. In this way, the interests of regional air quality managers and public health officials are closely aligned with efforts to mitigate climate change, because doing so will avoid climate effects on air quality, especially climate-driven increases in extreme events. The extreme diagnostics we calculate and report, which have not been a focus of previous studies, may therefore be valuable to policy makers and the public, and may be a worthwhile area for further research. The results and methodology reported here may be used in other regional or global studies to comprehensively improve the understanding of air quality and health impacts of climate change and extreme events, and they may also be applied in the investigation of the climate mechanism driving air quality change. For Chinese policy makers working to improve current air quality and protect public health, our finding is a daunting conclusion, and one that underscores the need to tackle the challenges of both climate change mitigation and air quality at the same time.</p>
