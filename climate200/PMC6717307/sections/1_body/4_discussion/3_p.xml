<p>Our findings here are subject to several important limitations and sources of uncertainty. First, given the high-resolution and computationally intensive methodology, our simulations are limited to a single climate-chemistry model. However, our finding that future climate change is likely to exacerbate China’s air pollution is broadly consistent with numerous previous studies (

In particular, several studies have indicated that weather conditions conducive to extreme haze will likely occur at a higher frequency in China under climate change as a result of large-scale circulation changes caused by the Arctic sea ice decline and the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon (
