<p>Thus, climate change is likely to increase air pollution mortality in China, and given demographic trends, our estimates of actual deaths may be an underestimate. The climate penalty effects on air quality and human health would be larger under a high climate scenario (e.g., RCP8.5 in 2100, which could be analyzed in future studies). They are more pronounced in densely populated and already polluted areas of China and in heavily polluted winters. Our results indicate that climate change is likely to increase the risk of severe pollution events in China, and thus alter the level of pollution control required to meet air quality targets.</p>
