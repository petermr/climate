<p>Our results also go beyond previous studies in revealing the outsized role of more intense climate extremes in future climate-driven air pollution mortality in China. In total, increases in future atmospheric stagnation events contribute 68% to the climate-driven increase in PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentration and 39% to the increase in air pollution-related mortality (incorporating a much smaller effect on ozone concentrations) (

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although less important than stagnation due to fewer event days, increases in future heat waves have a large effect on ozone concentrations, totaling 14% of the climate-driven ozone increase we project and 6% of the increase in air pollution-related mortality (

 </ext-link>), indicating that PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> increases dramatically under extreme conditions, while the ozone increases might be prevalent under both extreme and mean conditions due to climate warming. Given the substantial contribution from extreme weather events to the modeled increase in air pollution (especially PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) and mortality, as well as the dominant role that extreme weather events play in the increase in extreme haze events, we suggest that extreme weather events may be an important mechanism by which climate change will affect air quality, and especially PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>.
