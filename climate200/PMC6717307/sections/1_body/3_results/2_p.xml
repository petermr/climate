 </xref> shows the changes in fine particulate matter (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone concentrations that result from East Asian climate change from 2006–2010 to 2046–2050 in RCP4.5 (holding current emissions constant). Mean annual PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations increase by up to 9 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> on the North China Plain and in the Sichuan Basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>), and ozone season (April to September) averages of daily 1-h maximum ozone concentrations increase by 2 to 8 parts per billion (ppb) over large areas of eastern China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>). Further, the changes in PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentrations are greatest in the heavily populated north and east regions of China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2 
  <italic>A</italic> and 
  <italic>B</italic>
 </xref>), where aerosol loadings and ozone precursor emissions have been the highest in recent years. Increases in winter PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are both larger (e.g., increasing by 10% in the north region) and more widespread (

 </ext-link>). PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are also projected to decrease in some areas of the northwest region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref>) due to reductions in windblown dust (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1812881116/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2
 </ext-link>). Ozone concentrations are projected to decrease in areas such as the Tibetan Plateau, where precursor emissions are low and ozone destruction is accelerated by increased water vapor in the atmosphere (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, these improvements are exceptions; we project adverse air pollution impacts of climate change over 55% of the land area of China, areas that encompass roughly 85% of China’s current population. Thus, population-weighted average PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and ozone concentrations increase by 3% and 4%, respectively.
