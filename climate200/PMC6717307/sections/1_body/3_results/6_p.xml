 </xref> summarizes regional changes in air pollution deaths due to climate change, showing the large fraction of deaths associated with extreme events as opposed to changes in mean climate state (excluding extremes). As can be seen, atmospheric stagnation events (dark green) represent a particularly powerful mechanism for climate-induced air pollution mortality: 39% of all additional deaths (8,100 deaths, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6,900 to 9,300; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4

 </xref>). Increases in heat wave events (yellow) account for 6% of all additional deaths (1,200 deaths, 95% CI: 300 to 2,000; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4

 </xref>). In contrast, increases in heavy precipitation events (light green) act to decrease air pollution deaths somewhat in the future, especially in the north and south regions, as the precipitation increases the wet removal of aerosols and reduces the formation of ozone (

 </xref>). A relatively small fraction (less than 1%) of the additional deaths are associated with compound extremes because there are very few days when different types of extreme events occur simultaneously (
