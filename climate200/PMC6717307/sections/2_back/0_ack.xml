 <p>The CESM simulations were conducted by Tim Glotfelty (NCSU). We thank Khairunnisa Yahya (NCSU) and Tim Glotfelty for their help during generation of the initial and boundary conditions from the CESM for WRF-CMAQ simulations. We also thank Youhua Tang and Daniel Tong (both at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) for their help on the WRF-CMAQ boundary condition processor and also on the revised dust emission scheme. We acknowledge high-performance computing support from Yellowstone (ark:/85065/d7wd3xhc) provided by the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Computational and Information Systems Laboratory, sponsored by the NSF and Information Systems Laboratory.
