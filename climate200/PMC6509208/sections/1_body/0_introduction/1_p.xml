<p id="Par2">The initial human colonisation of South America was a rapid process that led to the dispersal of hunter-gatherer populations to every major biome on the continent within a few millennia, starting at the latest around 14 k calendar years before present (cal BP). Colonising groups successfully adapted to a broad range of environments during the Terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, from the Amazonian rainforest and Patagonian grasslands to the high Andes

 </sup>. In parallel, a growing body of archaeological evidence from several regions has suggested that climatic transitions acted as a driver of significant regional depopulation during the mid-Holocene. Discontinuities in archaeological records have specifically been linked to increasingly unpredictable climatic regimes around this transition. Abandonment or retreat to refugia is suggested to have occurred in central Amazonia
