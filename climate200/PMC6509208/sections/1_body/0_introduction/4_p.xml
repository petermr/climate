<p id="Par5">We also disaggregate the data into three regions for further analyses, comprised of: (a) the northern and central Andean Highlands, foothills, and foreland basin, (b) the tropical Lowlands of Amazonia and circum-Amazonia, and (c) the Southern Cone, incorporating the southern Andes, Pampas, and Patagonia. These subdivisions target variation in the structure of the archaeological data within broad topographic, biogeographical, and climatic realms. With reference to the systems driving rainfall variability across South America (Supplementary Information), these regions respectively approximate areas principally influenced by moisture transportation from the Atlantic, areas influenced by the Atlantic and potentially Pacific sources, and predominantly South Pacific/South Atlantic-influenced zones

 </sup>. We take consistent patterns in the radiocarbon data to reflect robust and independent trends in human population across regions rather than specific archaeological cultures. These patterns permit identification of demographic sensitivity to climatic variability on a scale below that of the continent as a whole (Methods). We discuss the behavioural and social consequences of climatic variability during the mid-Holocene for the pre-Columbian population of South America based on the available archaeological data, as well as the role of climate as a driver of cultural change in general.
