<p id="Par4">We initially test the radiocarbon record of South America against the same null hypothesis of exponential growth for the period 12–2 k 
 <sup>14</sup>C years before present, based on an assessment of curve shape and goodness-of-fit. Following the detection of statistically significant negative departures from this model starting at ~8.2 k cal BP, we expand our approach through a two-phase demographic model with the goal of pinpointing where a demographic regime change is most likely to start (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Next, following preceding research
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>, we define our mid-Holocene demographic expectations with reference to prevailing dynamics prior to the phase of decline in order to condition our expectations of what constitutes a significant departure against the prevailing trend identified in the prior regime.
