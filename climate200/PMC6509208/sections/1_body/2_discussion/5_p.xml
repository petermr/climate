<p id="Par14">Understanding mid-Holocene demographic patterns is predicated on our consideration of climatic variability, as well as against the backdrop of developments in cultivation practices. We follow recent research in noting that the scale of anthropic environmental legacies is necessarily linked to relative population over time

Our examination of the archaeological and climatic record of South America provides a continental-scale framework for understanding the interplay between population dynamics and food procurement diversification over the mid-Holocene, as well as questioning at what point climate change or instability demands alternative pathways be adopted by human populations. In this regard, the broadening of the trophic niche of humans through the adoption of a greater proportion of plant resources may have functioned as a buffer against environmental unpredictability

These demographic processes were not uniform in either time or space and likely encompass substantial variation below the spatial scale we have adopted here. In particular, previously-identified local responses to mid-Holocene climate change require further investigation in the context of our findings.
