<p id="Par10">An initial period of high climatic variability spans the transition from the early to the middle Holocene. Three steps (8.4k, 8.2k, and 8.1 k cal BP) have an exceptionally high frequency of anomalies and the ramping up of frequent anomalous events shown in our index (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) correlates with the initial drop in relative population observed across South America at and after 8.6 k cal BP. Archaeologists have repeatedly pointed to mid-Holocene aridity across South America as a mechanism driving occupational hiatuses in multiple localities, indicative of abandonment or logistic range reductions tethered to more predictable resources

 </sup>. As illustrated by our archaeological summed probability distributions, significant departures from the quasi-stable Early Holocene regime occurred at least until 6 k cal BP, in the form of several protracted periods of population decline. A second, attenuated phase of anomalous climatic events following the initial extreme phase reveals the continuing impact of climatic variability on human populations. Our results indicate that precipitation variability, as well as absolute reductions in moisture, may have acted as joint drivers of demographic change in leading up to and in the first half of the Middle Holocene
