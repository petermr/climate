<p id="Par13">Amidst the geographically-variable effects of climate change, South American populations themselves enacted modifications to local ecosystems through the deployment of plant management and cultivation practices

 </sup>. The precocious use and dispersal of comestible and useful plants began in the Early Holocene in South America, and the long-distance translocation of crops such as peanut (

 <italic>Zea mays</italic>) by the mid-Holocene

 </sup> highlights the deep antiquity of cultivation practices in the Neotropics. These and other species were integrated into diversified and likely regionally-specific multi-crop procurement systems at various times after 8.2 k cal BP

 </sup>. The deliberate and incidental use of fire to modify local ecologies also influenced and shaped the environmental niches of which these crops were a part

 </sup>. We suggest that the development of these intertropical systems is a crucial development in the context of significant population reduction relative to earlier periods. Under the stresses induced by both demographic and environmental conditions, anthropic ecologies that already incorporated cultivated or managed resources before the mid-Holocene may have become proportionately more important to subsistence strategies in the face of an unstable climate

 </sup>. The increasing visibility of cultivated plants in the palaeobotanical record from the mid-Holocene could suggest that climate change may have promoted the incorporation of a greater proportion of managed plants into tropical forager subsistence systems

 </sup>. Population recovery during the second half of the mid-Holocene (after 6 k cal BP) is consistent with a florescence linked to a diversified and more stable resource base following climatic stabilisation to a drier yet steady phase

 </sup>. A possible outcome of these cultural and environmental trajectories was the emergence, in some regions, of population aggregation and social institutions for the coordination and control of previously-unprecedented population densities among South American populations by the Late Holocene
