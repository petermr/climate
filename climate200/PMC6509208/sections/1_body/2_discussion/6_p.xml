<p id="Par15">The demographic signals highlighted on a broad scale in this work are composites of local archaeological records. Statistically significant deviations, whether negative or positive, invite further investigation into the trajectories adopted by human populations at a variety of spatial scales and settings. We anticipate that more research, ideally combining computational vegetation reconstructions and landscape modelling, will help to formally characterise how the demography of South America was shaped by, and in turn shaped, environmental conditions in the long term. Systematic assessments of cultural and biotic resilience to hydroclimatic variability are necessary to understand the development of both domains in the millennia following the human colonisation of South America.</p>
