<p id="Par18">We initially perform the analysis on the entire South America dataset. However, the global trend may mask significant regional variation in potential subsets of the data. With reference to spatial structure, sites tend to be highly clustered in, for example, the desert coast of Peru, while being diffuse in the central Amazon basin, rendering a single clustering metric inappropriate for discovering viable subdivisions. Formal methods for grouping spatial point patterns such as k-means or density-based clustering are, respectively, unable to adapt to the arbitrary shape of the point pattern and the high variation in the spatial density of sites. For the purposes of the analysis, we choose to partition the South American radiocarbon data into three to investigate human population patterns and capture variation in the structure of the data within broad biogeographical and climatic realms, rather than any specific archaeological cultures or phenomena. The appearance of consistent patterns in the radiocarbon data should therefore reflect robust and independent cross-regional demographic trends. An objective of our study is to consider coeval shifts in demographic and climatic regimes at and around the transition to the Middle Holocene (8.2â€‰k cal BP).</p>
