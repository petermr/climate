<p id="Par19">We have opted to divide all sites located above the 300 m elevation contour into northern and southern subsets along the Peru-Chile border, to form the core of the Highlands and Southern Cone datasets. Both sets include Pacific coast sites located to the west of the elevation cut-off point. We assigned dates from Bolivia in La Paz, Oruro, and Cochabamba departments to the Highlands, and those located in Chuquisaca, Tarija, and Potosí to the Southern Cone. The remainder of the Southern Cone consists of dates from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, and the Brazilian states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina. Sites located below 300 m above sea level and outside of the abovementioned elevation boundaries form the Lowlands dataset. These criteria produce three subsets of the data that group lowland Amazonia with the Guianas, the Orinoco basin, and northeast Brazil (here the Tropical Lowlands), the northern Pacific coast and Andes with the Amazonian foreland basin and foothills (here the Tropical Highlands), and finally the southern Pacific coast and Andes with the Pampas, Patagonia and the southern Brazilian highlands (the Southern Cone). With reference to the climatic systems that drive rainfall variability across South America (Supplementary Information), our subdivisions correspond approximately (in order) to areas principally influenced by moisture transportation from the Atlantic, areas influenced by the Atlantic and potentially Pacific sources, and predominantly South Pacific/Atlantic-influenced zones
