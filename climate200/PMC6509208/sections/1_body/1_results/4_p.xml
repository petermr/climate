<p id="Par9">In summary, we performed a parameter sweep on a broad range of possible null models for the Early and Middle Holocene. This indicated a critical breakpoint occurred at 8.6 k cal BP. To investigate the degree of departure from this stable (weakly linear) post-colonisation trend, we conditioned our null model on this data. When tested against simulated radiocarbon data generated with Monte Carlo methods, our results show a repeated and statistically significant downturn of varying duration and intensity after 8.6 k cal BP, concurrent with increasing climatic variability from this point in time. These phases last until at least 6 k cal BP, at which point a second regime shift appears likely

 <sup>14</sup>C record are present across highly diverse environmental and cultural settings, revealing widespread population decline during the mid-Holocene. Regional differences are detected through comparison with the structure of the continent-wide dataset (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and identifies separate phases of downturn in the tropical Highlands and Lowlands data. In contrast, the Southern Cone remains largely above or within the continental confidence envelope. In statistical terms, the tropical Highlands and Lowlands reveal approximately equivalent demographic trends with some local differences, while the Southern Cone is significantly different from both. Significant positive divergences from the continental trend suggests that this region apparently did not suffer the same degree of downturn during periods of high climatic variability. Accounting for time-dependent site loss and spatial variability in preservation and research intensity (Methods), the weight of the statistical evidence suggests that the depth of the mid-Holocene downturn reflects much more than an oscillation of local population levels around a stable mean

 </sup>. Rather, our results indicate that a phased demographic contraction over a period of several centuries took place across South America. Strong synchrony is evident between all three regions following peak climatic variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After the initial mid-Holocene, however, regional demographic responses diverge. Below we discuss possible impacts and consequences of this pattern in terms of the social and bioclimatic changes experienced by indigenous South Americans during this period of interest.
