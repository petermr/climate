<p id="Par6">Our results show that the demographic trend for South America falls significantly below expectations for population growth after 8.6 k cal BP. After this point in time, periodic and statistically significant population deflation in the archaeological 
 <sup>14</sup>C record is apparent on a continental level, lasting at least until 6 k cal BP (p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, left). This indicates that exceptional deviations from early Holocene demographic regimes occurred. The millennial-scale downturns associated to the initial Middle Holocene can be subdivided into three phases beginning with the initial dip in the demographic proxy at ~8.6 k cal BP, followed by ~7.7 k cal BP and finally ~6.9 k cal BP. These are bracketed by brief periods of recovery lasting two centuries or less. After the initial mid-Holocene, there is a return to model expectations, which are exceeded by ~5.3 k cal BP, likely marking the transition to a new demographic regime after ~6 k cal BP

 </sup>. Our index of variability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, right) is derived from a robust outlier analysis of multiple palaeoclimatic records that together provide spatial coverage of precipitation patterns across South America. Our summary index shows a rapid increase starting at 8.6 k cal BP, concurrent with the first phase of downturn, peaking more than two standard deviations above the dataset mean at ~8.4 and 8.2–8.1 k cal BP. Following a short hiatus coincident with recovery, a second spike prefaces a second bout of demographic reduction after ~7.7 k cal BP. A third (~6.9–6 k cal BP) phase of sustained population decline spans the transition to more arid conditions that are typically recognised in the mid-Holocene of South America

 </sup>. This is visible as a trough in our variability index punctuated by less intense yet above-average variability around 7.2 k and 6.5 k cal BP. Placing the frequency of hydroclimatic anomalies before and during the mid-Holocene transition alongside our demographic proxy illustrates the extent to which these patterns are coeval in time.
