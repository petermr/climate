 <caption> Test of summed probability distribution of calibrated archaeological 14C dates against a null model (grey shading) and climatic variability index. Left: Starting at 8.6 k cal BP South America experiences three phases of significant population deflation (blue shading). By the end of the mid-Holocene, the continental summed probability curve exceeds the null model (red shading). Right: (I) Exceptionally high climatic variability characterises the beginning of the mid-Holocene, with three time steps within 200 years of 8.2 k cal BP having an incidence of anomalies more than two standard deviations (light blue dashed line) above the mean (dark blue dashed line). (II) A second phase of cyclical high variability persists in the early mid-Holocene until 6.5 k cal BP. </caption>
