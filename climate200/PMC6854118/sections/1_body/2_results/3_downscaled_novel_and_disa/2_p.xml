<p>Disappeared climates were defined as LGM climates that did not exist during the modern era. Seven of the eight downscaled climate surfaces contained disappeared climates across Alaska, with rain being the exception. Overall, disappeared climates covered 55.9% of Alaska from the LGM to modern era.

Ecoregions most affected by disappeared maximum temperature climates were the Coast Mountain Transition (85.0%) and Pacific Mountain Transition (82.5%). The Coastal Rainforest ecoregion displayed the largest amount of disappeared snow climates in the state, covering 40.0% of the region (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Western Alaska also experienced disappeared climates in the Aleutian Meadows and Bering Taiga ecoregions due to disappeared PET climates; however, the fraction of disappeared climates were not as high as the southern portion of the state at 37.1 and 43.9%, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The Bering Tundra ecoregion contained the least amount of disappeared climates for all climate variables, containing &lt;10% of disappeared climates for the entire region. All other ecoregions and climate variables contained varying amounts of disappeared climates across Alaska (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
