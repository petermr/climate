<p>As spatial resolution becomes coarser, the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates generally increases, while the fractional area of shared climates generally decreases. All disappeared climate surfaces, except minimum temperature, had moderate (0.40–0.59) to very strong (0.80–1.00) Spearman's rank correlations between spatial resolution and fractional area, indicating that as the spatial resolution of climate becomes coarse, the fractional area of disappeared climates increases (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). All novel climate surfaces had a strong (0.60–0.79) to very strong (0.80–1.00) Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between spatial resolution and fractional area, indicating that as spatial resolution of climate becomes coarser, the fractional area of novel climates increases as well (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). All climate variables had a negative relationship between fractional area of shared climate and spatial resolution, as expected. The strengths of Spearman's rank correlations varied from moderate (−0.40 to 0.59) to very strong (−0.80 to −1.00; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35511-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).
