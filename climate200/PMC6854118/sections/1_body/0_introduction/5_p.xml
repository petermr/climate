<p>A key aspect of quantifying climate, including the identification of novel and disappeared climates, is the choice of spatial resolution. Spatial resolution has the potential to complicate the prediction of ecological impacts of climate change because climate varies dramatically at local scales and this variation is undetectable in coarse resolution climate data (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp,

Long‐term climate patterns observed across the globe are a result of a combination of many different processes that occur at varying spatial scales. Most modeled climate data (regional and general circulation models) are coarse scale (&gt;50 km), and these datasets are unlikely to incorporate many spatial features known to influence climate at finer scales (e.g., elevation gradients, coastal effects, temperature inversions, and rain shadows; Daly,
