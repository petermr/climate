<p>Postglacial climate change provides a useful context and natural experimentation for assessing biotic responses to global climate change (Davis,

The late quaternary, which includes the last glacial maximum (LGM) 21,000Â years ago, matches the magnitude of predicted anthropogenic climate change and contains the largest manifestation of natural climate change preserved in the geologic record (Mix, Bard, &amp; Schneider,

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). Our awareness and understanding of past ecological responses to climate change is important as it enables ecologists to predict the potential responses of ecosystems to anthropogenic climate change now and in the future.
