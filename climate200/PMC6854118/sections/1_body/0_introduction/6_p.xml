<p>Spatial variability in climate can be nested into macroclimates (global), mesoclimates (regional), topoclimates (landscape), and microclimates (local; Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Geiger, Aron, &amp; Todhunter, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Macroclimates are the broad patterns of atmospheric circulation across &gt;50 km scales, such as the North–South rainfall gradient along the state of Alaska (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Mesoclimates are variations at 1–50 km reflecting marine air and mountain range properties, such as rain shadow effects (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Topoclimates include landscape scale effects such as aspect, slope, elevation, and terrain that affect surface radiation, wind, and cold‐air drainage at the 10‐m to 1‐km scale (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Lastly, microclimates have the finest scale variability and are determined by vegetation cover and fine‐scale surface features (&lt;10 m; Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Finer spatial scales (topo and micro) create unique combinations of climate variables within a very limited area (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) and can provide significant processes that buffer against larger regional and global climate trends (e.g., temperature inversions; Randin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Willis &amp; Bhagwat, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). For example, mesoscale PRISM mean global temperature variability is limited to 3°C, while a finer toposcale mean global temperature surface at 30 m found a global temperature variability as high as 8°C (Ackerly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Daly, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>).
