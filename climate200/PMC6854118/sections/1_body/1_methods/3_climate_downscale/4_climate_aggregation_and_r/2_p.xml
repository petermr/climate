<p>To understand how climate grid resolution can potentially affect the distribution of novel and disappeared climates in Alaska, we aggregated each 60 m annual climate surface to coarser resolutions. Aggregation surfaces were created using a standard average pixel aggregation of each 60 m annual climate surface using the following resolutions: 120, 240, 800 m (e.g., PRISM), 1 km (e.g., NASA Nex &amp; WorldClim), 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 12 km (e.g., CMIP; Daly, Gibson, Doggett, Smith, &amp; Taylor,
