<p>The locations of novel and disappeared climates were summarized by computing the fractional area of novel, disappeared, and shared climates for the entire state of Alaska, as well as the fractional area among nine “Level 2” Alaskan ecoregions defined by the U.S. Geologic Survey (Gallant, Binnian, Omernik, &amp; Shasby, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). We used modern AK ecoregions for both the modern and LGM eras, since, to the best of our knowledge, no LGM ecoregion boundary datasets currently exist. We quantified the amount of novel, disappeared, or shared climate at a given spatial resolution and used a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to determine whether the relationship between novel, disappeared, or shared fractional climate and spatial resolution was positive, negative, or no apparent relationship.
