<p>The interactions of PET and available water can be described with additional water balance parameters: actual evapotranspiration (AET) and water deficit (DEF). AET and water deficit are biologically meaningful parameters that are well correlated with the distribution of vegetation types compared to other parameters such as temperature and precipitation (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). PET (i.e., evaporative demand) represents the total amount of energy available in the environment; essentially, the evaporative water loss from a site with unlimited water and is used to derive estimates of AET and water deficit (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). AET is the evaporative water loss given the actual water availability at a site and therefore represents the biologically usable energy and water in the environment (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). Water deficit refers to climatic water deficit, not soil water deficit, and represents the amount of evaporative demand that was not met by available water in other words: WD = PET − AET (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). While AET and water deficit are important for understanding the climatic controls of vegetation distributions, it is worth mentioning that all three parameters (PET, AET, and water deficit) are climatic products representing available water and energy at a site, not biological products dependent of specific vegetation types (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>).
