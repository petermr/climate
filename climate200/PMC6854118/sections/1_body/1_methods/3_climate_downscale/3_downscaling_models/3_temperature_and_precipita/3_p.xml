<p>Generalized linear models (GLM) were chosen to generate all downscale models. GLMs are advantageous for downscaling because they can extrapolate beyond the range of the model's training data, which is necessary when predicting LGM climates as the range of climates is likely different than the modern climate. Additionally, GLMs can handle more complicated situations; for example, they do not require a normal distribution of the response variable (Madsen &amp; Thyregod, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). A variety of tests/exploratory models were created to check that all GLM assumptions were met. To ensure that all input predictors were independent of one another, all variables were plotted against one another to verify that there were no significant relationships between each variable. A correlation threshold of 0.95 was used as a cutoff value preventing too great a multicollinearity between any pair of predictors. Additionally, an exploratory generalized additive model (GAM) was created to produce partial plots for each independent variable to verify linear behavior of all model inputs, although this method was not chosen for the final models to avoid spline interpolations on our predictors (Venables &amp; Ripley, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Lastly, each model's residuals were examined to ensure that the residuals were normally distributed. The residuals were plotted against the predicted fitted values to ensure a homogenous structure of each model's variance.
