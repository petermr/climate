<p>Plants must use energy and water to grow and reproduce; therefore, the primary effects of climate on plants are regulated by the interactions of energy and water (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">1990</xref>). Through water balance equations, energy is represented by potential evapotranspiration (PET) and available water (Stephenson, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>). PET was calculated at monthly time steps at 60 m for the LGM and modern era using the Penman–Monteith method which utilizes our downscaled temperature, elevation, wind speed, and cloud‐corrected irradiance surfaces as inputs (Allen, Pereira, Raes, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>; Monteith, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">1965</xref>; Penman, 
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">1948</xref>). This method determines a reference evapotranspiration from climate data and represents climatic water balance rather than physiological evapotranspiration. PET was calculated by using a standard hypothetical reference crop of height 0.12 m with a fixed surface stomatal resistance of 70 s/m and albedo of 0.23. Annual PET for the LGM and modern era was summarized by computing the summation of all monthly surfaces for each era.
