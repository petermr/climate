<p>Although a negative relationship between fractional area and spatial resolution occurred on only one climate surface, this phenomenon suggests it is possible to underestimate the amount of novel and disappeared climates when using coarse gridded climate products. Again, significant errors may arise when estimating postglacial climate change distributions leading to serious underestimations of novel and disappeared climate distributions, the potential impacts of climate change, and potentially propagating this error into other climate dependent analyses. However, this pattern is less likely to occur since it depends on the patchiness of novel and disappeared climates as opposed to gridded climate data's ability to capture landscape scale processes influencing climate patterns.</p>
