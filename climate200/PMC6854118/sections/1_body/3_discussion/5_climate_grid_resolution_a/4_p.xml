<p>Second, as climate data becomes coarser, there can be a negative relationship between spatial resolution and the amount of novel and disappeared climates, although this trend only occurred with our

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) reported a similar negative pattern when comparing the distribution of alpine species; however, Randin's study considered climate resolution with varying study extents. The combination of climate resolution and study extent was found to cause a negative relationship between the amount of suitable alpine species habitats and climate resolution/extent as their species distribution models were unable to capture the full environmental niche of alpine species at regional scale climate resolutions or limited study extents. Therefore, the negative pattern between alpine species distributions and climate data resolution from Randin et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) was not a product of heterogeneously complex climate surfaces.
