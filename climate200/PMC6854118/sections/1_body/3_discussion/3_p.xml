<p>Determining how climate resolution affects climate change predictions is necessary to avoid under or overestimating the potential impacts of climate change for ecological analyses dependent on gridded climate data. We downscaled climate data at 11 spatial resolutions spanning three orders of magnitude to include climate data at resolutions used for previous climate change impact projections to identify the distribution and abundance of novel, disappeared, and shared climates across Alaska, as well as how the spatial resolution of climate data used affects these estimates of climate (e.g., PRISM, BioClim, NASA Nex, CMIP; Daly et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35511-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). We found that novel and disappeared climates primarily affected Southern Alaska. Additionally, climate data generally increased the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates as the resolution became coarser; however, it was also possible, although rare, to decrease the fractional area or have no apparent relationship between the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates and climate data resolution.
