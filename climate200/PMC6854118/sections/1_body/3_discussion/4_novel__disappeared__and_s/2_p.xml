<p>All our downscaled climate surfaces, except rain, contained disappeared climates across Alaska. Rain was the only surface that did not contain disappeared climate because (a) rain values cannot reach lower than 0Â mm of precipitation (unlike temperature), and (b) environmentally, warm modern climates produce more rain and less snow, which can only extend the upper limit of possible modern rain values.</p>
