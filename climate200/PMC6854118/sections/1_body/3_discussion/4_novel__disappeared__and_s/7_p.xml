<p>While we have identified the least and most climatically vulnerable ecoregions to postglacial climate change, large variations in the abundance and distribution of novel and disappeared climates will also affect the significance of each climate variable on a refugia as specified by the optimal niche species. Situations arose where one to few climate variables contained substantial amounts of novel or disappeared climates, while many others contained low to no novel or disappeared climates. This is important for two reasons: First, if an ecoregion contained significant fractional areas of novel or disappeared climates, it does not necessarily imply that all climate variables within the same ecoregion experienced high amounts of novel or disappeared climates. For instance, the Coast Mountain Transition ecoregion in Alaska contained the largest fractional area of disappeared
