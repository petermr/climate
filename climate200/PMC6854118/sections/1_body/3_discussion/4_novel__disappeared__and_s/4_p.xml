<p>Only three of our eight downscaled climate surfaces contained novel climate distributions in Alaska. These surfaces included radiation, rain, and minimum temperature; however, novel climates were a rarer occurrence than disappeared climates. Less novel climates, when compared to disappeared climates, are likely an artifact of possible climate ranges of Alaska, since we considered only Alaska as our reference area of interest for this study, which ignores all other possible climate ranges across Earth. Additionally, as with disappeared rain climates, novel rain, snow, radiation, AET, PET, and water deficit climates are environmentally restricted. Therefore, due to natural postglacial and/or anthropogenic climate change, only the southernmost portion of Alaska could experience significant amounts of novel climates. Modern climate change has led to increasingly warmer minimum temperatures in the southern Aleutian Meadows and Coastal Rainforest ecoregions. Consequently, this has eliminated extremely cold minimum temperatures that were present during the LGM, while simultaneously increasing the amount of rainfall in the state due to more precipitation being converted to rain over snow. Additionally, these ecoregions are along the southernmost portions of the state, which are lowest in latitude and should therefore be warmer than any other region of Alaska.</p>
