  <p>Classification process for “novel,” “disappeared,” “shared,” and “both” climates. 2 km climate surfaces were used for visualization purposes for this figure, as “both” climates are almost nonexistent at 60‐m resolution. Novel climates are red, disappeared climates are blue, shared climates are black, and both novel and disappeared climates are purple. (a) Histogram of LGM and Modern radiation climate bin ranges to define novel, disappeared, and shared climate bins. (b) Novel/Shared climate locations at 10 km. (c) Disappeared/Shared climate locations at 10 km. (d) Union of maps b and c. Purple pixels are intersection locations where climate was both novel and disappeared at 10 km</p>
