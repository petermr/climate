 <caption> Coarser resolutions can decrease the amount of novel and disappeared climates in Alaska. Disappeared T min at 120Â m displays regions with patchy, but random spatial distributions, while coarse disappeared T min climates display clustered distributions. Isolated patches of disappeared T min climates at high resolutions will be reclassified to shared T min climates when upsampling T min climates to coarser scales using standard pixel aggregation methods </caption>
