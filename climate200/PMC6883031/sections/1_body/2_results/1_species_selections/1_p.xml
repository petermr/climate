<p id="Par28">Among the 449 species which breed or have bred in the Arctic
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>, 359 (80%) have a breeding range which overlaps to &gt;5% with the Arctic as defined by CAFF
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup>. Among those, 316 (88%) are migrants or partial migrants (see Supplemental Materials 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">III</xref>), and belong to 44 families (see Supplemental Materials 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">III</xref>). During winter, 29 of those species are pelagic (essentially alcids, gulls and skuas) and another 37 (mainly ducks and gulls) utilize costal marine habitats (see Supplemental Materials 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">III</xref>). Only 24 (see Supplemental Materials 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">IV</xref>) of those 66 species are likely to remain active during the polar night, and may become year-round residents to the Arctic in the future. Alcids and gulls represent 42% of those species but some ducks, cormorants, petrels, shearwaters and loons, are potential future residents. Overall, our bibliography study indicated that only 29 pelagic species (6.5% of all arctic breeding species) are potential candidates for future transarctic migrations (see Supplemental Materials 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">III</xref>).
