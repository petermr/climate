<p id="Par6">Currently, Arctic sea ice is an ecological barrier for migratory birds. Henningsson and Alerstam
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup> also rated transarctic migration as particularly difficult for birds because of navigational issues (but see
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>) and of the lack of stop-over sites. With sea ice constraining the availability of stop-over sites, more costly and risky non-stop transarctic flights are therefore unlikely. Conversely, migration along sea ice edges at the periphery of the Arctic Basin seems much more widespread

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Also, radar studies and direct observations demonstrated that several species of seabirds are capable of crossing the Arctic Basin

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
