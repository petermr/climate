<p>A more detailed analysis, strongly related to health impacts, looks at the length of extreme heat events. Therefore, the anomalies for the length of the longest heat wave per year are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Again, a similar pattern can be observed with a strong increase for the far future only for Rome for RCP8.5. For London and Luxembourg, in the near future for both RCPs a prolongation of approximately 3 days is calculated, and for the middle future 5 and 6 days, respectively. Once more, the strongest increase is observed for Rome with a prolongation of 18 days for RCP4.5 and 41 days for RCP8.5.
