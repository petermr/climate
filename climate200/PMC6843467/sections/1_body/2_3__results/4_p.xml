<p>The following four indices are based on different definition of heat waves compared to the WSDI (description in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-ijerph-16-03959">Section 2.2</xref>). For the absolute number of HWs, all thirteen ensemble members show positive anomalies compared to their individual reference periods. The boxplots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f003">Figure 3</xref> illustrates that there are no big differences in the absolute number of HWs between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. In both scenarios, there is an increase of one HW for London and Luxembourg for the near and two for the middle future. For the far future London and Luxembourg will have three more HWs for RCP 4.5 and four for RCP8.5.
