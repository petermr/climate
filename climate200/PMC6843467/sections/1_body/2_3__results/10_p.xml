<p>The last index describes the mean air temperature of all detected HWs per year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast to the others indices, here the results are less homogeneous. Especially for London, some of the ensemble members project even slight negative anomalies. However, overall a general increase for both RCPs in the mean air temperature during the heat wave can be observed for all cities and all future time spans. The differences for near future of the RCP4.5 scenario are not significant, those for the far future of the same RCPs are. For the middle future, only the differences between Rome/Luxembourg and Rome/London are significant. For the RCP8.5 in the near future the differences between Luxembourg/Rome and Luxembourg/London are significant, for the middle future all differences, and for the far future, Luxembourg/London and London/Rome.
