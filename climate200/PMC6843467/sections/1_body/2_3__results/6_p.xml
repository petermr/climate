<p>The number of days that contribute to the absolute number of HWs were analysed further (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-03959-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For both RCPs in the near future, only slight changes could be observed. Already in the middle future, differences become obvious between London and Luxembourg compared to Rome, and this effect is even more pronounced for the far future. The mean number of days that contribute to an HW in Rome amounts to 47 (RCP4.5) and 86 (RCP8.5) in the far future time span.
