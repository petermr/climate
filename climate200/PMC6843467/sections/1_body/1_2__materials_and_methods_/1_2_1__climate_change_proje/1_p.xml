<p>For the calculation of the climate change indices, long, simulation-based time series of meteorological data are necessary. We used time series derived from a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The regional climate model (RCM) data are based on simulations from the EURO-CORDEX initiative. This is the European branch of the CORDEX project. Data is made available on the data nodes of the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) model data dissemination system [
