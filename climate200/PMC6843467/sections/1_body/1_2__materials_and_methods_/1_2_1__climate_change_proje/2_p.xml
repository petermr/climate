<p>One of the EURO-CORDEX goals is the provisioning of regional climate change information [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] through a dynamical downscaling of the Global Climate Models (GCM) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], based on a coordinated multi-model, multi-physics experiment and providing transient model simulations from 1950 to 2100. Among the multiple CORDEX publications a basic analysis of climate change in the EURO-CORDEX ensemble is already available [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as well as an overview evaluation of the ensemble with respect to observations [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-03959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, the added value of the higher EUR-11 (about 12 km) EURO-CORDEX resolution versus the standard EUR-44 (about 48 km) has been already analysed [
