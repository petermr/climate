<p>The results of all calculated indices, as well as the original time series, were further analysed with SigmaPlot Ver.10 from Systat Software, Inc. The time series of the indices were grouped into four 30-year time spans (1971–2000 reference period, 2001–2030 near future, 2031–2060 middle future, 2061–2090 far future). The three future time spans (near, middle and far future) were then tested for significant differences (
