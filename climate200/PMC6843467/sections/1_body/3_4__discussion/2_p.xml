<p>In our analysis, we rely on a multi-physics and multi-model ensemble of different regional climate models forced with two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.). No weighting of the individual model results was used. To reduce the noise of the results, averages of 30-year time spans were calculated and it was these results that were finally used for the statistical analysis [
