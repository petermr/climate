      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Policymakers have had great difficulty, almost by definition, responding effectively
         to complex or what have been termed ‘wicked’ problems, many of which threaten human
         health. These challenges are a result of the defining features of wicked problems
         – their complex, numerous and sometimes undefined causes which are often globalized,
         their contested understandings and framings among stakeholders with different and
         strongly held beliefs and values, and their need for collective action sometimes on
         a global level but lack of simple planning responses [
         <a>1</a>, 
         <a>2</a>]. Climate change, biodiversity loss, persisting poverty, the growing obesity epidemic,
         and food insecurity are all examples of such wicked problems.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With obesity, for example, no country to date has reversed its obesity epidemic [
         <a>3</a>], despite a considerable amount of attention devoted to the importance of this issue
         [
         <a>4</a>], and a growing evidence base of the effectiveness of various solutions [
         <a>5</a>]. To a significant extent, this is due to the ideological debates surrounding the
         issue, often driven by industry actors and their well-funded lobbies defending vested
         economic interests and deliberately exploiting the complex or wicked nature of the
         problem, and thereby creating further uncertainty about causes and consequences. These
         debates include those of personal versus collective responsibility for action, supply-
         versus demand-type explanations for consumption of unhealthy food, the relative roles
         of physical inactivity and diet in weight gain, government regulation versus industry
         self-regulation, and treatment versus prevention priorities [
         <a>3</a>]. Similar debates and controversies surround discussions of the nature of, and how
         best to respond to, other wicked problems, and there is a documented industry strategy
         to influence country positions, create debate and confusion, and delay government
         regulatory responses [
         <a>6</a>, 
         <a>7</a>]. Given that many of these problems have a strong body of evidence in support of
         various intervention solutions for addressing them – and given the risks of not acting
         – what will it take to create the ‘tipping point’ needed for effective action?
