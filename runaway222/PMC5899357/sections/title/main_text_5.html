      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We may not have to wait for the respective apocalypses. A recent (2015) court ruling
         in The Hague, using the principles of tort law to address civil wrong-doings, held
         that the Dutch government’s stance on climate change was illegal, and ordered them
         to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020, relative to 1990 levels.
         Given the threat posed by climate change, the ruling included that cutting emission
         by a lesser among of 14% to 17% by 2020, as were the government plans at the time,
         was unlawful. Urgenda, an environmental non-profit organisation, filed the case on
         behalf of 886 Dutch citizens, suing the government for violating human rights by failing
         to take adequate action to prevent the harmful impacts of climate change [
         <a>8</a>, 
         <a>9</a>]. Thus, after two decades of international negotiations on climate change, heated
         national policy debates in many countries, and little policy change to address greenhouse
         gas emissions – and certainly not on the scale required – this judicial ruling may
         provide a way forward for addressing this and other wicked problems.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ruling uses a combination of Dutch civil law (the principle of a government’s
         duty of care) and existing human rights and climate changes treaties – a legal basis
         with potential to be used in courts elsewhere. Similar cases are in recent years being
         prepared in Belgium, Norway and the Philippines. 
         <span>The Guardian</span> speculated as to whether the Dutch judgement could inspire a global civil movement
         to address climate change [
         <a>8</a>]. However the case may also inspire civil movements and create a template from which
         to address other wicked problems.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public health experts have often suggested that addressing wicked problems affecting
         health will ultimately require government regulation and that, given governmental
         reluctance to act, and short of catastrophe, the impetus for such regulation will
         come from civil society [
         <a>10</a>]. The Dutch court ruling may be the ‘tipping point’ needed to force governmental
         regulatory change – something often hampered by conflicting stakeholder views and
         strong industry lobbies – by raising the political priority of the issue, and cutting
         through gridlock caused by institutional power imbalances by handing government a
         strong and legally binding mandate on which to act. Legal rulings ordering governments
         to address issues such as biodiversity loss, persisting policy, food insecurity or
         obesity may sound far-fetched, but are perhaps no less radical than how other important
         advances may have once been perceived, for example the introduction of sanitary law
         in nineteenth-century Britain [
         <a>10</a>]. But there are limitations. This legal strategy requires a well-functioning, democratic
         government, an effective judicial system, and a mobilised civil society. Not all countries
         have the legal system and requisite institutions within which this type of case could
         be brought against a government. It is also unclear exactly how the court will enforce
         its ruling. However the ruling does provide an example of a strategy for achieving
         domestic regulatory change that is likely to be replicable in some countries elsewhere.
