  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study took the employees working in institutional food service in northern Taiwan as the subjects. A quantitative survey was conducted using a questionnaire. With regard to the distribution of questionnaires, school dietitians in the northern part of Taiwan (Taoyuan City and New Taipei City) were asked to assist in forwarding the questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed to employees who have worked in the school lunch institutional company for 3 months and who have already spent 8 hr in the food safety courses, including chefs and kitchen workers. The subjects are anonymous and voluntary to fill out the questionnaires. One hundred questionnaire copies were distributed for the trial and 100 copies were returned; 400 questionnaires were formally issued, and 324 copies were returned. The recovery rate is 81%.</p>

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This study refers to the two leadership styles proposed by Burns (
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0013">1978</a>): transactional leadership and transformational leadership. The development of the questionnaire is for understanding the impact of these two leadership styles on the food safety and hygiene behaviors of the organizational climate and employees of institutional food services. The transactional leadership scale was adapted from Bass and Avolio (
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0008">2004</a>), with a total of five items; the transformational leadership scale was also modified from Lee, Almanza, Jang, Nelson, and Ghiselli (
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0031">2013</a>), with a total of four items.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scale of food safety and hygiene behaviors was modified from Boeck, Jacxsens, Bollaerts, and Vlerick (
    <a rid="fsn31056-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" href="#fsn31056-bib-0010">2015</a>). The items were adjusted to meet the research purposes of this study. The scale aims to measure the food safety and hygiene behaviors of the subjects with five items.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the above questionnaires were revised and adjusted to meet the research purposes of this study, the wording was revised for clarity. The measurement was based on a 5‐point Likert scale, ranging from 5 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), to measure the degree of consent of respondents to the items on the leadership style scale.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five experts confirmed the content validity of this questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha values for reliability of transactional and transformational leadership styles were 0.880 and 0.818, respectively; Cronbach's alpha value for the organization climate was 0.893; and Cronbach's alpha value for the scale of food safety and hygiene behaviors was 0.918. This study used the SPSS statistical software package as a tool for data analysis. The data analysis methods include narrative statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and regression analysis to examine the impact of leadership style on organizational climate, the impact of organizational climate on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors, and the impact of leadership styles on employees' compliance with food safety and hygiene behaviors, and to explore the mediating impact of organizational climate.</p>
