 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that policies can be classified along all logical combinations of the three examined paradigms (optimization, sustainability, safe operating space). This yields a classification of policies into eight different categories (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>).

    <p>Paradigms classification for risky and cautious policy. There exist policies in parameter space of our model for all logical combinations of paradigm classifications. 
     <span class="bold">a</span> i.e. a policy can be any combination of (not) optimal, (not) sustainable and (not) safe. Remaining parameters where chosen as 
     <span class="italic">ρ</span> = 0.2,

     <sub>min</sub>/

     <sub>h</sub> = 0.3) a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) exists, which we identified as the overlap of safe and sustainable policies

 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In particular, optimal policies are not necessarily sustainable (opt and not sus: Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, red and yellow). This is the case if the normative value threshold 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub> is too large. The cautious policy does not return enough value to be sustainable (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>l</sub> &lt; 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub>, yellow) and the risky policy at the degraded state produces too little future reward to be sustainable, due to the low chance of recovery and lack of farsightedness.
 </p>
 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nor are optimal policies necessarily safe (opt and not safe: Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, red and purple). This occurs in parameter regions where the risky policy is optimal. The risky policy cannot be safe because of the risk of collapse to the degraded state.
 </p>
 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A safe policy does not necessarily imply a sustainable policy either (safe and not sus: Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, green and yellow). When the normative threshold value for sustainability 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub> exceeds the reward from a low pressure action 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>l</sub>: 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>l</sub>, then the cautious policy is safe but not sustainable. Following a similar line of argument, the SOS concept
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>
  </span> has been extended to a Safe And Just Operating Space (SAJOS) which additionally accounts for social indicators
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>, such as the number of people living in extreme poverty. Thus, SAJOS policies can be interpreted as the overlap of safe with sustainable policies. Within our model, we can give a definite criterion for when this form of SAJOS exists: as long as the reward from a low pressure action 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>l</sub> exceeds the normative threshold value 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub> (
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>l</sub> &gt; 
  <span class="italic">r</span>
  <sub>min</sub>), the cautious policy is both safe and sustainable (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, cyan and gray).
 </p>
 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, there exist also sustainable policies outside the SOS (sus and not safe: Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, blue and purple.) These are risky policies (hence, not safe) with simultaneously high farsightedness 
  <span class="italic">γ</span> and low collapse probability 
  <span class="italic">δ</span>. At those parameter regions the degraded state is still evaluated as acceptable due to sufficient anticipated future rewards and therefore the risky policy is sustainable. The circumstance that parameter regimes exist that are sustainable but not safe and vice versa clearly stems from our definition of sustainability which resembles a form of weak sustainability
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
  </span>. By doing so we can conceptually separate issues of environmentally safe and socially just without compromising the target of a safe and just parameter space regime.
 </p>
 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note that this classification into the eight different policy paradigm combinations also applies to the case of absolute farsightedness (
  <span class="italic">γ</span> = 1; see the tops of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b–e</a>). Thus, the trade-offs between the examined paradigms do not vanish, as one might presume considering the debate about appropriate discount rates
