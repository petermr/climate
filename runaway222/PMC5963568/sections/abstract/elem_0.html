      <p>Based on lake sediment data, archaeological findings, and historical records, we describe
         rapid transformations, resilience and resistance in societies and ecosystems, and
         their interactions in the past in the North Water area related to changes in climate
         and historical events. Examples are the formation of the polynya itself and the early
         arrival of people, ca. 4500 years ago, and later major human immigrations (different
         societies, cultural encounters, or abandonment) from other regions in the Arctic.
         While the early immigrations had relatively modest and localised effect on the ecosystem,
         the later-incoming culture in the early thirteenth century was marked by extensive
         migrations into and out of the area and abrupt shifts in hunting technologies. This
         has had long-lasting consequences for the local lake ecosystems. Large natural transformations
         in the ecosystems have also occurred over relatively short time periods related to
         changes in the polynya. Finally, we discuss the future perspectives for the North
         Water area given the many threats, but also opportunities.
