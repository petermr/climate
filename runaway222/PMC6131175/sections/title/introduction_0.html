      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interannual variability in the Indian Ocean (IO) is dominated by the Indian Ocean
         Dipole (IOD) which develops in austral winter (June, July, August; JJA) and peaks
         in spring (September, October, November; SON)
         <span><a>1</a>,
            <a>2</a></span>. During the positive phase of the IOD, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are anomalously
         warm in the western equatorial IO (WEIO) and cold in the eastern equatorial IO (EEIO).
         Opposite anomalies occur during the negative phase, with cooler than normal SSTs in
         the WEIO and warm SSTs in the EEIO region. These SST anomalies (SSTAs) alter the atmospheric
         circulation over the tropical IO, impacting several countries surrounding the basin.
         The consequences of an IOD event were most widely felt in 1997 when an extreme positive
         IOD occurred
         <span><a>1</a>–
            <a>3</a></span>. This event caused heavy rainfall over parts of East Africa, culminating in widespread
         flooding and the spread of infectious diseases
         <span><a>3</a>,
            <a>4</a></span>. On the eastern side of the IO, Australia and Indonesia experienced drier than normal
         conditions, resulting in drought and bushfires
         <span><a>3</a></span>. This 1997 extreme positive IOD coincided with an extreme El Niño and the widespread
         consequences of these extreme events led to significant research on the IOD. It is
         now known that these impacts over East Africa
         <span><a>5</a>–
            <a>8</a></span>, Australia, and Indonesia
         <span><a>9</a>–
            <a>13</a></span> typically occur during positive phases of the IOD. Negative IODs impact these countries
         in an opposite manner (i.e., East Africa experiences drier than normal conditions
         whilst Australia and Indonesia are wetter), but the impacts from these events tend
         to be relatively weaker compared to positive IODs. This is caused by the positive
         skewness of the IOD where positive events tend to be stronger in amplitude than negative
         events
         <span><a>14</a>–
            <a>16</a></span>. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that an absence of negative IOD events may explain
         Australia’s recent droughts such as the Millennium Drought
         <span><a>11</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The severe and widespread impacts of the IOD highlights the importance of understanding
         its response to a warmer climate and there have been several studies examining this
         response using either a single coupled general circulation model (CGCM) or a multi-model
         ensemble
         <span><a>17</a>–
            <a>22</a></span>. Models partaking in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) tend
         to exhibit a positive IOD-like warming pattern over the tropical IO, with weaker (stronger)
         warming in the EEIO (WEIO) and an easterly wind trend
         <span><a>17</a>,
            <a>18</a></span>. This response is driven by the projected weakening of the Walker circulation in
         a warmer climate, which is behaviour displayed by the majority of models
         <span><a>23</a>–
            <a>26</a></span>. As the Walker circulation weakens, extreme positive IODs such as the 1997 event
         are projected to increase in frequency by almost three times by the end of the 21
         <span>st</span> century
         <span><a>3</a></span>. The weakening of the mean westerly winds over the equatorial IO allows reversals
         of the wind and ocean currents to occur more often, causing strong cooling in the
         EEIO.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Analysis of individual CGCMs or multi-model ensembles does not account for internal
         climate variability as each model has its own internal variability and biases. To
         understand and capture internal climate variability, a single CGCM with an ensemble
         of simulations with the same external forcings must be used. This differs from perturbed
         physics ensembles where parameters are varied in a model which in turn generates different
         responses to the climate system. Projects involving large ensembles have been performed
         previously and this has allowed studies in climate extremes, trends, and uncertainty
         in projections
         <span><a>27</a>–
            <a>30</a></span>.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of internal climate variability on the IOD and its properties has not
         been widely studied although a recent paper has examined the role of internal climate
         variability in the IOD’s response to a warmer climate
         <span><a>30</a></span>. It is suggested that the uncertainty in IOD amplitude change due to internal variability
         may account for up to 50% of the inter-model uncertainty in CMIP5. However, there
         appears to be no correlation between IOD amplitude variability and mean state change
         in the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE)
         <span><a>30</a></span>. This differs from CMIP5 where the uncertainty (or spread) of models’ IOD amplitude
         is associated with changes in the mean state
         <span><a>18</a>,
            <a>30</a></span>. Here, we examine the influence of internal climate variability on properties of
         the IOD through variations in the mean state of the tropical IO. We show instead that
         small differences in the mean thermocline depth, which arise due to internal climate
         variability, can influence projected changes in IOD properties.
