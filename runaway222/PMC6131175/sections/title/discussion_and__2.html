      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence of the mean thermocline state on IOD properties is clearly evident in
         the strong correlations exhibited in CESM-LE but it is important to remember that
         there may be biases in the model. Compared to observations, the climatological thermocline
         slope in CESM-LE is opposite, with the EEIO thermocline depth being considerably shallower
         than the WEIO region (Table 
         <a>S1</a>) whereas in reality, the WEIO is slightly shallower than the EEIO
         <span><a>32</a></span>. This bias is not unique to CESM-LE and is common amongst CMIP3 and CMIP5 models
         <span><a>32</a></span>. As a result, the mean easterly winds and the zonal SST gradient are overly strong
         in CESM-LE and thus the Bjerknes feedback is also too strong. This causes the simulated
         IOD amplitude to be considerably larger than observations. Nevertheless, this bias
         is consistent amongst all thirty-five runs examined as the parameterisations and physics
         in each simulation are identical.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As each ensemble member differs only in its initial condition, where a small round-off
         error is applied, any difference between ensemble members arises from internal climate
         variability. Over the EEIO, this emerges as small differences in climatological thermocline
         depth and in the present-day period the difference in depth between the shallowest
         and deepest simulations is approximately four metres (Table 
         <a>S1</a>). Although the spread amongst the thirty-five simulations is relatively small, the
         variations in mean thermocline depth are enough to generate significant correlations
         with IOD amplitude, skewness, and the mean zonal SST gradient. This highlights the
         importance of the mean state and the Bjerknes feedback for the IOD.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These relationships are important for projections of IOD properties and in CESM-LE
         the present-day climatological thermocline depth is significantly correlated with
         changes in IOD amplitude and skewness. It has been suggested that there is no relationship
         between the change in IOD amplitude and the change in the mean state of the tropical
         IO and this is true when examining the whole tropical basin
         <span><a>30</a></span>. However, in observations the IOD is dominated by the EEIO region where SST variance
         is largest
         <span><a>14</a>,
            <a>35</a></span> and CESM-LE also exhibits this behaviour. Over the EEIO, the climatological thermocline
         shoals considerably more than the WEIO with the multi-member ensemble median change
         of −8.3 metres in the east compared to a median deepening of 0.8 metres in the west
         (Table 
         <a>S1</a>). Therefore, by focusing on the EEIO, we are able to show that internal variability
         of the mean EEIO state and its response to a warmer climate can influence IOD properties.
