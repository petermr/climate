      <p>The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the dominant mode of interannual variability over
         the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) and its future changes are projected to impact the
         climate and weather of Australia, East Africa, and Indonesia. Understanding the response
         of the IOD to a warmer climate has been largely limited to studies of individual coupled
         general circulation models or multi-model ensembles. This has provided valuable insight
         into the IOD’s projected response to increasing greenhouse gases but has limitations
         in accounting for the role of internal climate variability. Using the Community Earth
         System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), the IOD is examined in thirty-five present-day
         and future simulations to determine how internal variability influences properties
         of the IOD and their response to a warmer climate. Despite small perturbations in
         the initial conditions as the only difference between ensemble members, significant
         relationships between the mean state of the IO and the IOD arise, leading to a spread
         in the projected IOD responses to increasing greenhouse gases. This is driven by the
         positive Bjerknes feedback, where small differences in mean thermocline depth, which
         are caused by internal climate variability, generate significant variations in IOD
         amplitude, skewness, and the climatological zonal sea surface temperature gradient.
