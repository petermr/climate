      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The authors of this paper, action researchers actively involved in the Thames Estuary
         2100 Programme and the Dutch Delta Programme, and practitioners with a central role
         in the application of the adaptation pathway approach in these programs, analyzed
         the experiences with the real life application of the adaptation pathway approach.
         In this paper, the authors reflect on the process and end results of the phase of
         strategy development. A systematic approach has been followed to collecting, compiling,
         and analyzing experiences with adaptation pathways approach (APW) to identify lessons
         learned and best practices.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main source for deriving the lessons learned from these experiences is the discussions
         between the practitioners and the action researchers. In addition, use is made (in
         the case of the Delta Programme) of four surveys and evaluations that were done in
         the period 2013–2016. The first one is a large-scale survey of the Delta Programme
         in 2013 by the Erasmus University Rotterdam (Verkerk et al. 
         <a>2014</a>). The 1481 visitors of the Delta Congress 2013 were invited to contribute to an extensive
         survey (100 questions addressing 12 issues). Six hundred forty-five people filled
         in the questionnaire (43%). The second source is a study on the governance of the
         Delta Programme after the publication of the Delta Programme 2015 (van Buuren and
         Teisman 
         <a>2014</a>). A total of 13 representatives of national ministries, 23 representatives of regional
         steering groups responsible for the regional sub-programs, and 4 representatives of
         branch organizations of regional and local authorities were interviewed and 5 regular
         governmental meetings were used to exchange thoughts on the functioning and results
         of the Delta Programme. Source 3 is an independent review focused on the use and added
         value of Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) and the adaptation pathways approach in the
         Dutch Delta Programme (Rijke 
         <a>2014</a>). The sub-programs of the Delta Programme were interviewed and asked to contribute
         to an online survey. In addition, observations were made during meetings of the ADM
         core team as they prepared and evaluated the ADM training workshops for the regional
         teams responsible for constructing the adaptation pathways. The fourth source is a
         formal legislative ex-post evaluation of the Delta Act, executed in 2016 (Algemene
         Bestuursdienst TOP Consult 
         <a>2016</a>). In the context of that evaluation, 15 top key players were interviewed (deputies
         of provinces, mayors of cities, chairs of advisory committees, top authorities of
         waterboards, the minister responsible for water management, etcetera) and three thematic
         roundtables were organized with each on average 10 specialists in the fields of flood
         risk management, freshwater availability, and spatial planning. Input for the formal
         evaluation was also generated from discussions with the managers of the regional and
         thematic sub-programs of the Delta Programme and with 16 non government organizations
         (NGOs) involved in the same fields as the Delta Programme.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the case of TE2100, additional sources of review have included a survey of key
         stakeholders carried out by Kingsborough (author) in connection with his work on piloting
         adaptation pathway methodologies for heat, water resources, and surface water flood
         risk in London, United Kingdom linked to the Greater London Authority (GLA) and the
         London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP). An initial review of project reports and
         stakeholder interviews was undertaken to understand how TE2100 incorporated adaptation
         monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). Follow-up interviews were completed to identify which
         stakeholders are responsible for monitoring which indicators, who uses the collected
         information, and for what purpose. TE2100’s adaptation M&amp;E approach was reviewed to
         learn more about the barriers and enablers of adaptation M&amp;E (Kingsborough 
         <a>2016</a>; PhD thesis). Another key source was the TE2100 5 Year Monitoring Review, which provided
         detailed information and experience of monitoring and reviewing 10 key indicators.
         This was particularly useful in terms of highlighting the need for picking up changes
         in indicator trend from natural variability and points the way forward to useful research.
         It is one of, if not, the first comprehensive monitoring reviews of a major strategy
         based on adaptation
         <a>1</a>pathways. The results of the discussions between stakeholders and action researchers
         were combined with the results of the surveys and evaluations to formulate the experiences
         of applying adaptation pathways (see Section 
         <a>5</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid biased perceptions towards the authors’ own work, the respective experiences
         were discussed in a number of workshops during national and international conferences
         held in the period 2011–2015. Experiences in the Netherlands have been discussed with
         both scientists and practitioners in, amongst others, the National Delta Conference
         in 2011 (Amsterdam) and the European Conference on Climate Adaptation in 2013 (Hamburg)
         and 2015 (Kopenhagen). The United Kingdom (UK) experiences were discussed in, amongst
         others, the Sea level Rise Conference 2010 (Corpus Christi, Texas), the Sea level
         Rise Conference 2012 (Wellington, NZ); the Mekong Technical Workshop 2012 (Khon Kaen,
         Thailand), Water, a resource for the metropolis (2013) Paris; and the CIWEM National
         Conference (2014) London. Both cases were discussed in the international conference
         Deltas in Times of Climate Change in 2014 (Rotterdam) and the Decision Making Under
         Uncertainty working sessions in 2014 (Santa Monica) and 2015 (Delft). The insights
         gained in these conferences and workshops from presentations and discussions with
         scientists and practitioners were fed into the development of the ADM approach during
         meetings of the ADM core group.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The results from these discussions formed the basis for formulating challenges for
         the further development of the approach (Section 
         <a>6</a>). The results have been compared with experiences from application of APW in programs
         from other domains, which have been documented in the scientific literature. After
         collecting, compiling, and analyzing the experiences with APW, lessons learned and
         best practice have been identified in Section 
         <a>8</a>. Figure 
         <a>1</a> summarizes the process flow of the research.
