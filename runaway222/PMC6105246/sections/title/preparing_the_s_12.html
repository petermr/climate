      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While in theory, the pathways approach is “neutral” to the choice of the type and
         order of measures, practice shows that the selected pathway or the preferred strategy
         often contains incremental measures in the short-term, firmer measures in the mid-term
         and (options for) system-changing interventions or transformational measures in the
         long term. The rationale behind it seems obvious: the longer the time-horizon, the
         larger the climatic challenges, thus the heavier the interventions.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, the distinction between these categories is gradual and depends on the
         geographical and timescale that is considered. Using a geographical scale of several
         hundreds of kilometers and a timescale of several decades, concrete measures can be
         used to typify the three categories. Incremental measures are for instance series
         of local dike strengthening projects. Firm measures constitute a more robust approach,
         designed to meet upfront the more challenging of plausible futures. An example is
         the construction of regional bypasses in a river system to reduce the risk of flooding.
         Transformational measures drastically change the present system, preparing it to counter
         the most extreme situations. A typical example would be the construction of a new
         dam in an otherwise open estuary.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Incremental measures are “protective” in the sense that they can be considered as
         investments in a further gradual improvement of the resilience of the present system.
         Flipside is that this may increase the transfer costs to a new or significantly modified
         system. Increasing the resilience of the present system may also lead to an increase
         of sunk costs, further heightening the threshold for switching from an incremental
         strategy to a transformational strategy. Research on ancient societies has shown that
         sunk-cost effects can increase the vulnerability of a society (Scheffer et al. 
         <a>2003</a>; Janssen et al. 
         <a>2003</a>; Scheffer and Westley 
         <a>2007</a>). This is one of several psychological barriers that limit both climate change mitigation
         and adaptation (Gifford 
         <a>2011</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continuing on the path of incremental measures may enlarge path dependency. Useful
         information on this effect might be generated by comparing alternative adaptation
         pathways using a cost-benefit analysis that covers the complete period of the adaptation
         pathways (several decades, a century) and takes into consideration the issues of sunk
         costs and transfer costs. Specific attention is needed for dealing with the fact that
         discounting may blur the picture at the long-term end of the trajectory.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is often stated that there are many plans for transformational measures, but that
         these measures are implemented only as a reaction to extreme events. Comparable to
         the TE 2100 Plan, the Delta Programme aims “to stay ahead of major floodings.” Due
         to climate change, transformational measures are inevitable in the long term. So at
         some point in time, the transition from incremental strategies to transformational
         strategies will have to be made. Though several authors have addressed the difficulty
         of making a 
         <span>planned</span> shift to transformational strategies (Folke et al. 
         <a>2010</a>; de Haan et al. 
         <a>2014</a>; Kates et al. 
         <a>2012</a>; Lonsdale et al. 
         <a>2015</a>; Rijke et al. 
         <a>2013</a>), it has not been tackled yet adequately.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this analysis, it also follows that middle-term investments in the resilience
         of the present system should be re-evaluated in the light of a possible future transition
         to a significantly modified system. Options are to adopt shorter depreciation periods,
         or to consider alternative measures that are specifically designed for relatively
         short periods.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A challenge for the adaptation pathways approach is to visualize (increases in) the
         path dependency of a strategy and (in) the transfer costs related to switching from
         one strategy to another (within an adaptation pathway or between two different ones).
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observations and suggestions implicitly assume that decision-making is a more
         or less rational, scientific data driven process. Real-life decision-making is often
         blurred by institutional and political considerations.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eriksen et al. (
         <a>2015</a>) argue that “adaptation is a social-political process that mediates how individuals
         and collectives deal with multiple and concurrent environmental and social changes”
         (p. 523). The adaptation pathways approach, like other approaches developed for rationalizing
         decision-making in the face of uncertainty, does not automatically address the political
         aspects of decision-making. They argue for “reframing adaptation to take account of
         how the exercise of power is always present within climate change responses. (…) Our
         concern is to (…) hold in view how any transformational adaptation pathway will inevitably
         be plagued by contradictory outcomes” (p. 524).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the basis of their research, Van Buuren et al. (
         <a>2016</a>) conclude that “specific mechanisms of path dependency, for example, the existing
         power asymmetries between competing coalitions and the intricate complexity of flood
         policies, prevent institutional change, but cannot prevent ideas about resilience
         slowly gaining more impact.” (p. 41). This implies that conservative powers may block
         or slow down necessary transformations.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hermans et al. (
         <a>2017</a>) have studied the adaptation pathways constructed in the Dutch Delta Programme and
         conclude that “different types of signposts exist. Technical signposts, in particular,
         need to be distinguished from political ones, and require different learning processes
         with different types of actors.”(p. 29). This improves—and complicates—the analysis.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
         <a>2015</a>) point out that the different strategies making up an adaptation map or route map
         may require different institutional and sociocultural conditions. Climatological and
         social economic scenarios that favor a certain strategy may not automatically also
         favor the necessary conditions. They also signal challenges with regard to the governance
         needed to keep options open for future, an important aspect of the way adaptation
         pathways were developed in the Dutch Delta Programme. Especially in the case of transfer
         options that require larger, transitional changes, the institutional and social cultural
         conditions are important constraint factors (Grin et al. 
         <a>2010</a>). Van der Brugge and Roosjen (
         <a>2015</a>) also warn that the resistance to change in the existing social technical regimes
         should not be underestimated. The governance challenges have remained implicit in
         adaptation pathway approach—and are considerable.
