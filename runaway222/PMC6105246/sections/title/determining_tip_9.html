      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining tipping points in the absence of precise policy goals, for intrinsically
         flexible strategies and in situations with large natural variability
      </div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An implicit assumption of the adaptation pathway approach is that some physical parameter,
         be it climatic conditions influencing probabilities of a flood, or socio-economic
         developments influencing possible consequences of a flooding, changes gradually, thus
         slowly but surely forcing society to react and ultimately switch to a different strategy.
         This approach seems to work best in the case of gradual-trend-dominated developments
         like sea level rise, forcing a clear-cut decision on for instance the upgrade or replacement
         of a flood surge barrier.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Determining tipping points proved challenging in other contexts. Attempts to operationalize
         the adaptation pathways developed for freshwater availability in terms of defining
         when the next generation of measures should be implemented have temporarily been put
         on hold, as it has become clear that the policy objectives in that field were not
         precise enough to determine an approximate timing of the tipping points under the
         different climatologic and socio-economic scenarios (Knikpunten in zicht, Deltares
         2017, in Dutch). The strategy chosen in the Delta Programme for the threats of flooding
         from the sea is “beach nourishment.” In this strategy, sand is supplied in the sea
         close to the coast, thus reducing wave erosion. This strategy is intrinsically flexible:
         every year, the volume of sand supplied can be enlarged or decreased depending on
         the rate of observed sea level rise. In that case, it is not possible—and not necessary—to
         determine tipping points.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The monitoring of the changes in the frequency of storms, droughts, and heat waves
         remains difficult, due to the lack of observations of extreme events, which are by
         definition rare. In the case of climate change-induced changes in peaks of river discharge,
         research combining monitoring data with model calculations shows that the natural
         variability in river discharge is so high that even when rapid (but not extreme) climate
         change is assumed, it can take 3 to 4 decades before the climate change signal can
         actually be distilled in a statistically sound way from monitoring data of river discharge
         (Diermanse et al. 
         <a>2010</a>; Klijn et al. 
         <a>2012</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a practical point of view, research is needed to find alternative approaches
         and/or parameters for distilling the climate change signals from river discharge measurements.
         This could be achieved through combining data-based detection of changes in observed
         events and exploration of possible future events through scenarios and modeling (Hall
         et al. 
         <a>2014</a>). Accordingly, Haasnoot et al. (
         <a>2015</a>) have identified a possible signaling role for decreasing summer river discharge
         as an indicator for changes in peak river discharge in the River Rhine. Dakos et al.
         (
         <a>2015</a>) point at the possibility of detecting early warning signals of a nearby tipping
         points by monitoring indicators of “critically slowing down.” Alternatively, large
         ensemble climate experiments (currently used for event attribution) may provide an
         alternate approach to better quantify the changing probability of extreme events (Kay
         et al. 
         <a>2011</a>; Pall et al. 
         <a>2011</a>). Such an approach could be used, for example, to probabilistically model the magnitude
         of the current 1 in 100-year heat wave event and compare this to the historic 1 in
         100-year heat wave event. This could be updated every 10 years and thus becomes a
         useful tool in monitoring changing climate risk over extended timescales. Nevertheless,
         for a comprehensive approach for distilling climate signals from highly variable river
         discharge measurements is not yet readily available for policymaking purposes.
