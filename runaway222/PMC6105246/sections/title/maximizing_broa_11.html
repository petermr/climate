      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adaptation pathways make explicit what measures can be taken in the short term and
         sketch possible future measures. Decisions about these future measures can be taken
         in due time. The fact that final decisions about the actual implementation of these
         future measures are (as long as dramatic events do not happen) often not taken before
         physical conditions (climatic, socio-economic), justifying them are actually met—or
         can be predicted with relative certainty—implying that societal anticipation to these
         measures is hindered.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, as long as the decision to increase freshwater availability is not taken,
         farmers arguably will hesitate to invest heavily in expansions of their business that
         increase the dependency on abundant availability of freshwater, because that availability
         will be harder to guarantee in most climate scenarios if large-scale interventions
         are not taken. So by postponing the final decision to execute the measure, “unwanted”
         anticipation is prevented. The described anticipation is “unwanted” because the expansion
         of the business would increase the dependency of abundant freshwater, where the original
         goal of the intervention was to promote resiliency of the agricultural sector by decreasing
         this dependency.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other side, taking the final decision not to execute the measure in the short
         term has the distinct advantage that more actors are challenged to prevent an increasing
         dependence of freshwater in other ways. For instance, companies can choose to invest
         in innovative purification methods or new salt-resistant crops.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Depending on the nature of the measure, on the costs and benefits for different actors
         of anticipating the measure, and on the direction the anticipation works in relation
         to the direction that was meant by the measure itself, the postponing of the final
         decision can constitute a net advanta
         <span>g</span>e or a net disadvantage.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These trade-offs should be taken in consideration in planning the moment for making
         the final decision about the actual implementation of a measure.
