 <p>Panel A is the six-region 
  <span class="italic">World Climate</span> interface through which participants enter decisions, including the year they choose (if any) to halt the growth of emissions, begin to decline and the annual rate of decline (%), with changes in deforestation and afforestation (on scales of 0–100%, with 0 being business-as-usual and 100% being the maximum possible effort). The model immediately displays the resulting CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions trajectories (panel A left), global mean surface temperature anomaly relative to pre-industrial levels (panel A right) and other impacts. B: Screenshot showing CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions and net removals for the scenario entered in panel A (panel B left), illustrating the “carbon bathtub” [
  <a rid="pone.0202877.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0202877.ref033">33</a>], i.e., that the stock of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere accumulates anthropogenic CO
  <sub>2</sub> emissions less the net CO
  <sub>2</sub> flux from the atmosphere to biosphere and oceans. Users can carry out a wide range of sensitivity tests by choosing values for parameters affecting, e.g., climate sensitivity and the strength of both positive (e.g., Arctic methane) and negative (e.g., CO
  <sub>2</sub> fertilization) feedbacks in the climate system (panel B, bottom left). C: C-ROADS enables users to explore economic and population data linked to emissions (e.g., GHG emissions per capita shown in panel C, left), and to compare the fit between the model and historical data for GHG concentrations and to projected global surface temperature in CMIP5 models through 2100.
