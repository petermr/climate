  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Twenty-two relevant publications were identified, describing 17 unique determinant frameworks (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). Database searches yielded a total of 1113 publications, of which 67 were considered potentially relevant and retrieved in full text. The searches yielded three publications each describing a unique determinant framework: Cabana et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]; Cane et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] (TDF); and Harvey and Kitson [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] (PARIHS). Seven publications were excluded because they did not describe a determinant framework, and one publication was excluded because the setting was not health care.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How were the determinant frameworks developed?</div>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The frameworks were developed in three different ways, as described in the investigated publications. Eleven frameworks are based on literature reviews of empirical studies and of theories, models and frameworks used in implementation science to describe determinants of various implementation-relevant outcomes: Cabana et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>]; Fleuren et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>]; Greenhalgh et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]; Cochrane et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]; Nutley et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]; Feldstein and Glasgow (PRISM) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" href="#CR41">41</a>]; Damschroder et al. (CFIR) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]; Gurses et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>]; and Flottorp et al. (TICD) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>]. Presumably the framework by Rainbird et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>] is also based on a literature review, although details about how this framework was developed are not actually provided. The basis of the framework developed by SURE [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>] is also somewhat unclear; it is simply stated that “published lists of barriers for implementing changes in health care often show a high degree of overlap” ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>], p. 6), implying that it was developed based on the existing literature. Fleuren et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>] combined the literature review with a Delphi process involving 44 implementation experts.
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four of the frameworks are based on the authors’ own implementation experiences and/or empirical studies. PARIHS [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>] emerged from the observation that successful implementation in health care might be premised on three key determinants (characteristics of the evidence, context and facilitation), a proposition that was subsequently analysed in four empirical studies. PARIHS subsequently underwent substantial research and development work [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>]. The revised i-PARIHS was proposed by Harvey and Kitson ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>], p. 2) based on their own “ongoing application of the framework in implementation studies together with critiques and evaluations of the framework by other research teams”. Grol and Wensing ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>], p. 558) based their work on “analyses of the literature and research conducted at our research centre”. Similarly, the AIF [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" href="#CR42">42</a>] combined the developers’ implementation experiences with literature reviews. Mäkelä and Thorsen [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>] referred to “previous work in the area” and data from various projects within a project called Concerted Action of the Changing Professional Practice ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" href="#CR43">43</a>], p. 24).
  </p>
  <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two frameworks are derived from existing theory or theoretical assumptions rather than experience or empirical studies. The framework by Wensing et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] was based on an analysis of the literature concerning theories on behaviour or organizational change in a variety of disciplines. It is not stated how many theories were identified, but the searches continued “until the overview of theories was ‘saturated’” ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>], p. 16). The TDF [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>] was constructed on the basis of a synthesis of 128 constructs related to behaviour change found in 33 established social-cognitive behaviour change theories.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What terms are used to denote contextual determinants?</div>
  <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Six of the 17 frameworks explicitly refer to “context” as a contextual determinant category [

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. The other 11 frameworks use a broad range of terms to denote various contextual determinants, including terms such as “external barriers” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], “environmental factors” [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" href="#CR37">37</a>], “environment” [

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How is context conceptualized?</div>
  <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the 17 frameworks do not provide specific definitions of context. Instead, they define the concept indirectly by describing a number of contextual determinants (categories and/or sub-categories) that together make up the context. Three frameworks [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] provided a specific definition of the context concept.
  </p>
  <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CFIR [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] is presented in a paper that provides a definition of context although the framework itself refers to “inner and outer setting” rather than context: “Context consists of a constellation of active intervening variables and is not just a backdrop for implementation. … For implementation research, ‘context’ is the set of circumstances or unique factors that surround a particular implementation effort … In this paper, we use the term context to connote this broad scope of circumstances and characteristics” ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>], p. 3).
  </p>
  <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The TDF includes one category, “environmental context and resources”, that explicitly refers to context. This category is defined as “any circumstance of a person’s situation or environment that discourages or encourages the development of skills and abilities, independence, social competence and adaptive behaviour” ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>], p. 14).
  </p>
  <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kitson et al. ([
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>], p. 150] define context in relation to PARIHS as “the environment or setting in which the proposed change is to be implemented”. The revised version of PARIHS, i-PARIHS, has a wider focus on the different layers of context, differentiating between the immediate local level, the wider organizational level and external health system level, something that was not done in the original PARIHS [

  <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The 12 context dimensions pertain to different levels of aggregation, from the micro to the macro level of health care. At the micro level, patients can influence implementation. Four broader organizational determinants can be attributed to the meso level: organizational culture and climate, organizational readiness to change, organizational structures, and organizational support. The macro level consists of even broader, “outside”, influences from the wider environment. It was not possible to attribute six of the context dimensions to a single level of aggregation because they may affect both the micro and meso levels (and to some extent also the macro level): social relations and support, financial resources, leadership, time availability, feedback and physical environment.</p>
  <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most common context dimensions were organizational support (included in all 17 frameworks), financial resources (16 frameworks), social relations and support (15 frameworks), leadership (14 frameworks), organizational culture and climate (12 frameworks) and organizational readiness to change (12 frameworks). The least common dimension was physical environment (2 frameworks). Patients as a contextual determinant was addressed in 11 of the frameworks.</p>
