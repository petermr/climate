  <result pre="The concept of internal variability is not without ambiguity since" exact="climate" post="has various sources of non-stationarity, and what is meant"/>
  <result pre="by internal variability is conditional on any non-stationary influence, including" exact="climate" post="change itself. Furthermore, knowledge of internal variability is limited"/>
  <result pre="warming. Nevertheless, in most cases, the main uncertainty in what" exact="climate" post="conditions will be experienced at a particular place and"/>
  <result pre="similarly assessed, at least in principle. The uncertainty in the" exact="climate" post="response to forcing is conceptually very different. It is"/>
  <result pre="very different. It is not a property of the physical" exact="climate" post="system; rather, it is a property of a state"/>
  <result pre="of the epistemic uncertainty is not particularly well known. First," exact="climate" post="models are imperfect representations of reality and share many"/>

  <result pre="by a factor of two, which is hardly negligible. Most" exact="climate" post="model simulations are performed with much smaller ensemble sizes,"/>
  <result pre="Another conceptual challenge in dealing with the epistemic uncertainty of" exact="climate" post="change is that the concept of ‘error’ is not"/>
  <result pre="observations to define all relevant aspects of future climate; future" exact="climate" post="will in any case be non-stationary; and model projections"/>

  <result pre="understand the relationship between model errors in observable aspects of" exact="climate" post="and the forced response simulated by that model—so-called emergent"/>
  <result pre="That an aleatoric interpretation of multi-model ensembles can blur the" exact="climate" post="information contained within those ensembles is not difficult to"/>

  <result pre="climate information, within their particular context. Both imperatives move the" exact="climate" post="risk problem outside the domain of pure climate science."/>
  <result pre="move the climate risk problem outside the domain of pure" exact="climate" post="science. Moreover, the recognition that epistemic uncertainties are deterministic"/>
  <result pre="ask what would be the effect of particular interventions—e.g. different" exact="climate" post="forcing scenarios, or different adaptation measures—across a range of"/>
  <result pre="any case the societally relevant ones. This reframing of the" exact="climate" post="risk question from the prediction space to the decision"/>
  <result pre="37, 38]. What is novel is their application to physical" exact="climate" post="science, where, perhaps because the system obeys known physical"/>
  <result pre="impression of objectivity. The different uncertainties that are relevant to" exact="climate" post="risk, and the different human decision points, can be"/>
  <result pre="broadly represented as follows. There is uncertainty in the future" exact="climate" post="forcing, which is mainly anthropogenic in origin, and represents"/>

  <result pre="information and the design of ensembles of simulations using regional" exact="climate" post="models, including the representation of particularly extreme forms of"/>

  <result pre="a finite-dimensional system. However, they very much correspond to how" exact="climate" post="scientists reason. For example, the El Niño variability in"/>
  <result pre="temperatures drives a Rossby-wave teleconnection pathway which affects circulation and" exact="weather" post="regimes in the mid-latitudes, and all these elements can"/>

  <result pre="blocks for the construction of causal networks relevant to regional" exact="climate" post="risk. (In practice, the ‘dynamical conditions' node in figure"/>

  <result pre="extremely powerful and are widely used in the interpretation of" exact="climate" post="information. The first is what is known as ‘pattern"/>

  <result pre="are different for transient and equilibrated warming levels, and short-lived" exact="climate" post="forcers such as aerosol can have distinct regional effects"/>
  <result pre="59]. Such additional degrees of freedom, as well as global" exact="tipping points," post="could be incorporated by making the node G suitably"/>
  <result pre="is the distinction between thermodynamic and dynamical aspects of regional" exact="climate" post="change, which has already been discussed. While the distinction"/>
  <result pre="it has even been used for the last two Dutch" exact="climate" post="change scenarios [ 61]. As with the other simplifications"/>
  <result pre="This paper has argued that the storyline approach to regional" exact="climate" post="change information avoids the straightjacket that hampers the standard"/>
