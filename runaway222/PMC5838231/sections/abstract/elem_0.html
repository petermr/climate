      <p>Soil moisture-precipitation (SM-P) feedback significantly influences the terrestrial
         water and energy cycles. However, the sign of the feedback and the associated physical
         mechanism have been debated, leaving a research gap regarding global water and climate
         changes. Based on Koster’s framework, we estimate SM-P feedback using satellite remote
         sensing and ground observation data sets. Methodologically, the sign of the feedback
         is identified by the correlation between monthly soil moisture and next-month precipitation.
         The physical mechanism is investigated through coupling precipitation and soil moisture
         (P-SM), soil moisture ad evapotranspiration (SM-E) and evapotranspiration and precipitation
         (E-P) correlations. Our results demonstrate that although positive SM-P feedback is
         predominant over land, non-negligible negative feedback occurs in dry and wet regions.
         Specifically, 43.75% and 40.16% of the negative feedback occurs in the arid and humid
         climate zones. Physically, negative SM-P feedback depends on the SM-E correlation.
         In dry regions, evapotranspiration change is soil moisture limited. In wet regions,
         evapotranspiration change is energy limited. We conclude that the complex SM-E correlation
         results in negative SM-P feedback in dry and wet regions, and the cause varies based
         on the environmental and climatic conditions.
