 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing provides global soil moisture information over a large spatial view. CCI provides the longest time series of global satellite soil moisture from 1979–2013, which is used in this study. The data are combined by active and passive microwave satellite observations. The active data sets are generated by the University of Vienna and are based on observations from the C-band scatterometer of the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and the Meteorological Operational Satellite (MetOp-A). The passive data sets are based on observations from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TRMM TMI) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The accuracy of the CCI data is acceptable when validated using global ground-based observations, and the mean correlation coefficient (
