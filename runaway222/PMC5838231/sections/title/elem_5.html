            convective system and boundary layer are investigated using land-atmosphere models.
            Although the method addresses land surface-atmosphere interactions, it contains uncertainty
            because of the complex interactions of the variables, weakening the reliability of
            the results
            <span><a>26</a></span>. Therefore, we investigate the feedback based on a statistical analysis. The coefficient
            of correlation (
            <span>r</span>) is adopted to identify the sign of SM-P feedback
            <span><a>15</a>,
               <a>36</a></span>. Considering the time lag effect of soil moisture on precipitation, we evaluate the

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is difficult to evaluate the physical mechanism of SM-P interaction using soil
            moisture and precipitation information because the latter variable has a direct impact
            on the former, and their causal relationship cannot be easily identified
            <span><a>46</a></span>. Evapotranspiration links the surface water and energy balances, which affect the
            feedback

               <a>47</a>–
               <a>50</a></span>. Therefore, we estimate the feedback by introducing evapotranspiration into the feedback
            loop. Koster 
            <span>et al</span>.
            <span><a>48</a></span> proposed a feedback framework based on the concept of water balance. It sub-divided
            the feedback as the coupling of the wetting soil by precipitation (P-SM), enhancement
            evapotranspiration by the wetted soil (SM-E), and enhancement precipitation by the
            high evapotranspiration (E-P) (Fig. 
            <a>8</a>). From this framework, the sign of the feedback can be easily identified. According
            to the feedback loop, negative SM-P feedback occurs when one or three of the sub-divisions
            is/are negative.

            to capture global water and climate change. Data sets of satellite remote sensing
            and ground observations are used to investigate the SM-P feedback in this study. Global
            soil moisture data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and global precipitation
            data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) are adopted to identify
            the feedback. The evapotranspiration data from FLUXNET and near-surface temperature
            from the University of Delaware Air Temperature &amp; Precipitation data set are used
            to estimate the physical mechanism and the climate conditions associated with the
            feedback. To analyze the spatial patterns, we evaluate the feedback in different climate
            zones. The zones are defined using the updated classification of Koppen-Geiger

               view. CCI provides the longest time series of global satellite soil moisture from
               1979–2013, which is used in this study. The data are combined by active and passive
               microwave satellite observations. The active data sets are generated by the University
               of Vienna and are based on observations from the C-band scatterometer of the European
               Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and the Meteorological Operational Satellite
               (MetOp-A). The passive data sets are based on observations from the Scanning Multichannel
               Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical
               Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TRMM TMI) and the Advanced Microwave
               Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The accuracy of the CCI data
               is acceptable when validated using global ground-based observations, and the mean
