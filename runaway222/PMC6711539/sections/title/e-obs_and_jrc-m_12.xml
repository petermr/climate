 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the purpose of the present study, the JRC-MARS data were translated onto the same grid as the E-Obs data by using the nearest grid cell. As the two datasets are generated using different methodologies, a simple student’s t-test comparison between the two was performed (where the variables were provided for both datasets). This comparison identified that there were some months where the maximum of the daily minimum temperatures, the mean of the daily minimum temperatures, the maximum of the daily mean temperature, the maximum of the daily precipitation amounts and sum of the daily total precipitation were statistically different between E-Obs and JRC-MARS. For this reason, all of the analyses conducted in this study use both datasets to enable common features to be assessed for their relevance to pest survival. Data are taken for the period 1986–2015.</p>
