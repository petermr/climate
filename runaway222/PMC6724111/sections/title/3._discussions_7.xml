 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since plant growth in the tundra is mainly temperature limited, the marked increase in daytime temperature can promote photosynthesis in OTCs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00271-f002" href="#plants-08-00271-f002">Figure 2</a>; 
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t001" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t001">Table 1</a> and 
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t002" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t002">Table 2</a>). The relatively smaller increase in nighttime temperature is beneficial to the reduction of carbon consumption by respiration (
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t001" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t001">Table 1</a>). Thus, the environment of OTCs is expected to have positive effects on plants in the alpine tundra. However, the responses of leaf photosynthesis, morphology and anatomy to OTC warming for the three species in the present study are not always positive and show species-specific reactions. Previous studies also indicated that different species grown in the Antarctic were differently affected by warming [
  <a rid="B17-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-plants-08-00271">17</a>,
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00271">22</a>]. For example, warming changed the photosynthesis and anatomical structure of 
  <span class="italic">Colobanthus quitensis</span>, but it had no effects on those of 
  <span class="italic">Deschampsia antarctica</span> [
  <a rid="B17-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-plants-08-00271">17</a>,
  <a rid="B22-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-plants-08-00271">22</a>]. These results suggest that measurements at the individual species level are still needed to better understand and predict the responses at the community and ecosystem level of tundra vegetation under future climate warming.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The photosynthesis of high alpine plants have been found to increase [

  <a rid="B24-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24-plants-08-00271">24</a>] in response to climate warming. In the present study, the 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub> of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> was significantly increased by warming. 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> also showed increases in 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub>, but the magnitude of stimulation was smaller than in 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>. By contrast, warming tended to reduce 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub> of 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum.</span> We also found increased leaf size in 2016 had not been maintained in 2017 for 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span>. Thus, 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> probably acclimated to long-term warming treatment. Similarly, Carroll et al. also found different responses of photosynthesis and leaf size to warming in three dominant tree species (
  <span class="italic">Pinus contorta</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">latifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Populus tremuloides</span>) [
  <a rid="B25-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-plants-08-00271">25</a>]. Long-term responses of photosynthesis to changes in temperature can cause a shift in optimum temperature of leaf photosynthesis, which stimulates photosynthesis at the new growth temperature, or changes the shape of the photosynthesis-temperature curve without shifting optimum temperature [
  <a rid="B26-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B26-plants-08-00271">26</a>,
  <a rid="B27-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27-plants-08-00271">27</a>]. Plants growing in the cool region can also increase the activity of photosynthesis-related enzymes to acclimate to warming, thereby enhancing photosynthesis [

 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photosynthesis and morphology exhibit comparatively strong plasticity to warming. Leaf anatomical features are relatively less susceptible to environmental change, and therefore the variations in anatomy might reflect long-term adaption to warming. We asked whether the differential responses of photosynthesis to long-term warming related to specific morphology and anatomical adjustments. No observed anatomical determinants of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> were affected by warming compared to the controls. However, the leaf size of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> was significantly stimulated, which means the total photosynthetic area and photosynthate increased. By contrast, the photosynthetic response of 
  <span class="italic">Colobanthus quitensis</span> in the Antarctic to warming relied on specific adjustments in the anatomical determinants, which enhanced photosynthetic assimilation, thereby promoting plant growth [
  <a rid="B17-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17-plants-08-00271">17</a>]. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the leaf anatomical traits, palisade tissue might be the most important to photosynthesis because palisade mesophyll cells are the structural powerhouse of photosynthesis. The thickness of palisade mesophyll has been found to be positively correlated with net photosynthetic rate [
  <a rid="B21-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-plants-08-00271">21</a>]. However, both the 
  <span class="italic">P</span>
  <sub>max</sub> and AQY of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> were significantly increased, which is inconsistent with the anatomical traits. This indicates that photosynthesis, at least for 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica,</span> does not integrate closely to anatomical characteristics, which does not support our hypothesis. Photosynthesis is relatively sensitive to environmental factors, like temperature, light and water status. The activity of photosynthesis-related enzyme increases with temperature, which will stimulate photosynthesis but not necessarily cause changes in anatomical structure. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We found increases in leaf size of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Rh. Confertissimum</span> in response to long-term warming. The leaf area and growth are determined by the fraction of photosynthate required for plant respiration. In the present study, increased leaf size, photosynthesis and number of individuals (32% in the warming OTCs vs. 25% in the control plots) of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> in OTCs imply significant advantages of this species in a warming world. Larger leaves in shrubs of 
  <span class="italic">Cassiope tetragona</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Salix arctica</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Dr. integrifolia</span> were also observed in the Canadian High Arctic after 16 years of warming treatment (+1~2 °C) [
  <a rid="B19-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-plants-08-00271">19</a>]. Similar palisade thickness but relatively thinner leaf thickness in 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> than in 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> and 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> (
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t004" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t004">Table 4</a>) suggests that 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> will grow better than the other two species if the Changbai Mountain tundra continues warming. Taken together, our results suggest that global warming will benefit 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span> in the tundra on Changbai Mountain. In the long term, warming favors greater dominance by 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>. Based on differential responses of photosynthesis and leaf size to warming among the three dominant tree species (
  <span class="italic">Pinus contorta</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">latifolia</span>, 
  <span class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Populus tremuloides</span>) in a community, Carroll et al. concluded that forest composition will be altered in a future warming world [
  <a rid="B25-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B25-plants-08-00271">25</a>]. Thus, we may also predict that future warming might promote expansion and enhance the cover of 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>, whereas 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> may be at risk for gradual occupation by other species, which could lead to changes in the tundra ecosystem function on Changbai Mountain.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thinning of the leaf and thickening of epidermis cells in 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> by warming probably imply less diffusion space of CO
  <sub>2</sub> in spongy parenchyma. Similar results were observed by Schollert et al. that the epidermis of 
  <span class="italic">Betula nana</span> in Greenland was also thickened by OTC warming [
  <a rid="B21-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B21-plants-08-00271">21</a>]. The cuticle thickness of 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> in the warming was higher than the control in September (
  <a rid="plants-08-00271-t004" ref-type="table" href="#plants-08-00271-t004">Table 4</a>). This situation in 
  <span class="italic">Rh. confertissimum</span> is not beneficial for photosynthetic carbon uptake but probably good for water conservation in the long term if the climate continues to warm. Bacelar et al. reported that a thicker epidermis (including cuticle) was an anatomical adaptation to improve water conservation [
  <a rid="B28-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-plants-08-00271">28</a>]. A thicker epidermis in response to warming may be a structural adaptation for prevention of water loss. However, a significant decrease in adaxial and abaxial epidermis thickness with decreased leaf thickness in 
  <span class="italic">V. uliginosum</span> under warming was also observed in the present study. Similar results of decreased epidermis thickness to warming have been found in some boreal forest species such as 
  <span class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</span> and 
  <span class="italic">Populus tremula</span> [
  <a rid="B20-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B20-plants-08-00271">20</a>,
  <a rid="B29-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-plants-08-00271">29</a>]. For 
  <span class="italic">Dr. octopetala</span> var. 
  <span class="italic">asiatica</span>, warming had no effects on the epidermis thickness and other leaf anatomical traits, which is in accordance with results in 
  <span class="italic">Empetrum hermaphroditum</span> [
  <a rid="B11-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-plants-08-00271">11</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">No significant changes in palisade-spongy parenchyma ratio have been observed for the three species, but with an increased trend in

  <a rid="B11-plants-08-00271" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11-plants-08-00271">11</a>]. The higher palisade-spongy parenchyma ratio suggests a compact arrangement of cells and high mesophyll surface area which could facilitate CO
