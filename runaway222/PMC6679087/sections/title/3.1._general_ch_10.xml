  <a rid="ijerph-16-02624-t003" ref-type="table" href="#ijerph-16-02624-t003">Table 3</a>). Others were technical reports (9%, 3/34), theses/dissertations (6%, 2/34), a discussion article, and a conference paper. Sixty-eight percent (68%, 23/34) of the selected articles and papers were published/dated from 2011 to 2017, while only 11 were published in the previous decades. Health topics tackled in these studies were varied, but about half were on mosquito-borne diseases (53%, 18/34), mostly on dengue (50%, 17/34), and only two on malaria. Some were water-related (26%, 9/34), such as diarrheal diseases, helminth infections, and leptospirosis. Other communicable diseases that were studied were meningitis (6%, 2/34) and measles (3%, 1/34). Four (12%) were related to mortality due to non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. One (3%) studied malnutrition in children. Spatial resolutions of the selected studies were mostly city-level (47%, 16/34), and there were least on a region-level (15%, 5/34). Fifty-nine percent (59%, 20/34) of the institutional affiliations of the first authors were from Philippine institutions, while the remaining were from other countries, such as Japan and the US. Eighteen of the studies (53%) were funded by foreign institutions, while only two (6%) received funding from Philippine agencies.
