      <div>Conceptual diagram of the influence of SLR on wave heights, wave-driven runup, and
         flooding and the resulting impact on atoll island groundwater.

      <p>(
         <span>A</span>) Current sea level. (
         <span>B</span>) Future elevated sea level. SLR will allow for greater wave heights, 
         <span>H</span>, and wave-driven runup, 
         <span>R</span>, than at present, resulting in frequent overwash that will contaminate the atoll
         island’s freshwater lens. High vertical exaggeration in schematic.
