      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The future impacts of seawater overwash and subsequent flooding on the freshwater
         lens were investigated using the SUTRA model (
         <a><span>18</span></a>). These simulations take into account various stages of higher sea level, estimated
         saltwater ponding over the surface of Roi, and natural recharge of wells via rainfall.
         The annual wave events derived from the future oceanographic flood modeling were used
         to drive overwash. Then, following these overwash events, the temporal evolution of
         the freshwater-lens seawater contamination (chloride concentrations relative to potability
         levels) was simulated with the same groundwater pumping rate and timing as occurred
         in the years following the 2008 flooding event. Future recharge (2080–2099) was estimated
         using rainfall and evapotranspiration based on future climate modeling of the RCP8.5
         scenario. Modeled climate data were processed for historic (1990–2009) and future
         (2080–2099, RCP8.5) conditions to compute mean monthly change factors for rainfall
         amount, number of rain days, and reference evapotranspiration to compute recharge
         for future conditions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future sea levels and worst-case annual seawater flooding scenarios were estimated
         as described in the “Wave-driven flood modeling” section. SLR scenarios of +0.4, +0.8,
         +1.2, and +1.6 m (RCP8.5 estimates of SLR at Roi-Namur in 2035, 2055, 2075, and 2090,
         respectively) and the associated annual wave-driven flooding were simulated. For each
         scenario, the coastline of the island was reduced accordingly on the basis of island
         topography, and then the estimated maximum seawater flooding distribution was applied
         to the model for a 2-day period each year. The response of the freshwater lens was
         evaluated on the basis of how the salinity (chloride concentration) of water at the
         skimming well changed during the recovery time period. Under some climatic scenarios,
         it was necessary to carry out these simulations for several years after a single overwash
         event so that the full duration of the lens recovery could be resolved. Finally, simulations
         of three consecutive years of annual overwash and flooding events during dry, average,
         and wet recharge conditions with representative withdrawal patterns for each year
         were completed.
