Modeled time periods were limited to the years 2026–2045 and 2085–2100, as prescribed by the CMIP5 modeling framework, and interpolated to the 2035–2105 time frame at 10-year time steps. The resulting modeled deep-water wave heights, wave periods, wave directions, wind speeds, and wind directions were analyzed using published methods (
