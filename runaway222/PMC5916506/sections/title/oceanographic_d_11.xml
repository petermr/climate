 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To calibrate and validate the physics-based, numerical nearshore hydrodynamic model, an 18-month field experiment was conducted on Roi-Namur Island in Kwajalein Atoll, and concurrent far-field, deep-water wave and wind-forcing data were acquired. Together, these observations elucidated the influence of water depth (as related to tidal and atmospheric forcing) on wave propagation and transformation across the atoll rim and over the reef flats for a range of oceanographic and meteorologic conditions. The 18-month field experiment consisted of three consecutive 6-month deployments in which two cross-shore arrays (

  </a>) were installed on the north, oceanside coastline of Roi (western portion of Roi-Namur). Each cross-shore array consisted of three bottom-mounted RBR wave/tide gauges over the reef flat and one on the upper fore reef. Between the two adjacent transects, an upward-looking 600-kHz Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current meter was placed on the fore reef. In addition, to capture wave and tidal conditions in the lagoon, an RBR wave/tide gauge and an RBR tide gauge were placed on a dock pier.
