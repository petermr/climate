      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Past efforts that relied solely on passive SLR inundation modeling to predict when
         atolls will become uninhabitable suggest that many atoll islands may remain suitable
         for human habitation until 2100 or 2150 (
         <a><span>8</span></a>). The results presented here, however, demonstrate that when the nonlinear interaction
         between SLR and wave-driven overwash and the subsequent island flooding are taken
         into account, the timeline for sustainable human habitation on these low-lying atoll
         islands shortens considerably. Not only will such flooding affect terrestrial infrastructure
         and habitats, but also, more importantly, it will make the limited freshwater resources
         nonpotable and, therefore, directly threaten the sustainability of human populations.
         On the basis of the limited topographic (
         <a><span>7</span></a>–
         <a><span>10</span></a>) and hydrogeologic (
         <a><span>10</span></a>, 
         <a><span>17</span></a>, 
         <a><span>25</span></a>) data available for atoll islands, Roi-Namur is characteristic of (if not of higher
         elevation than) most of the thousands of atoll islands in the world’s oceans. Assuming
         that this is the case, then the tipping point, at which point potable groundwater
         on most of the atoll islands will be unavailable, is projected to be reached by no
         later than the 2030s for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse climate scenario, by the 2040s
         for the RCP8.5 scenario, and 2060s for the RCP4.5 scenario. Island inhabitants will
         therefore be unable to rely on groundwater, in many cases the sole source of fresh
         water, as a source of potable water in the next few decades, and thus, the islands
         will be uninhabitable by the middle of the 21st century—not by the end of the 21st
         century or the middle of the 22nd century as previously suggested (
         <a><span>8</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For those rare atoll islands where groundwater is not a limiting resource due to rainfall
         capture, desalinization facilities, transport from elsewhere, etc., the tipping point
         at which most of those atoll islands would be flooded annually is projected to be
         reached in the 2060s for the RCP8.5+icesheet collapse climate scenario, the 2070s
         time frame for the RCP8.5 scenario, and sometime after the 2110s for the RCP4.5 scenario.
         These findings have relevance not only to populated atoll islands in the Marshall
         Islands but also to those in the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands,
         Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and Northwestern
         Hawaiian Islands. In addition, because the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand was highest
         in the Marshall Islands (
         <a><span>8</span></a>), providing the greatest vertical accommodation space for coral reefs to grow up
         into, the Marshall Islands are likely some of the highest atolls in the Pacific. Therefore,
         the timing of the tipping points presented here may be conservative (later in the
         future) compared to most of the other atoll islands that formed under lower mid-Holocene
         sea levels and, thus, have lower elevations. Islands fronted by wider, shallower reef
         flats with high coral coverage will have tipping points further in the future, whereas
         islands with narrower, deeper reef flats with lower coral cover (
         <a><span>15</span></a>) will reach these tipping points sooner than described here for Roi-Namur. Last,
         if coral bleaching events (
         <a><span>26</span></a>) and ocean acidification (
         <a><span>27</span></a>) also increase in frequency and/or magnitude because of global climate change, then
         live coral coverage will decline, resulting in increased depths and reduced hydrodynamic
         roughness of the reefs. This will further enhance wave energy propagation to the shoreline
         and subsequent wave-driven flooding (
         <a><span>14</span></a>–
         <a><span>16</span></a>), causing tipping points to be reached sooner than projected here.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the focus of the effort presented here is on low-lying coral atoll islands,
         our findings are relevant to other tropical, reef-lined islands. Because most high
         tropical islands such as those found in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans receive
         enough rainfall on their mountains to generate freshwater resources at elevations
         unreachable by wave-driven runup, wave-driven coastal flooding will likely not threaten
         their freshwater resources. However, because most of these islands’ housing and critical
         infrastructure (ports, roads, airports, hospitals, power plants, water treatment plants,
         etc.) are located within a few meters of current sea level, they are also vulnerable
         to increased wave-driven overwash due to SLR.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These projections of low-lying atoll island sustainability through the 21st century
         contrast with the recent hypotheses (
         <a><span>28</span></a>, 
         <a><span>29</span></a>) that islands will endure through the SLR projected through the end of the 21st century
         (
         <a><span>3</span></a>, 
         <a><span>4</span></a>). Those hypotheses were based on observations of how uninhabited islands’ planform
         areas migrated but maintained themselves over a period of limited (&lt;0.3 m) SLR during
         the 20th century. However, our results, as well as those from other studies (
         <a><span>15</span></a>, 
         <a><span>16</span></a>), demonstrate that a more critical metric than island planform area is the elevation
         of the island above the current sea level, because that elevation controls the frequency
         and magnitude of wave-driven overwash and island flooding. Although studies (
         <a><span>7</span></a>, 
         <a><span>28</span></a>) have shown that storms and wave-driven overwash can contribute to island formation
         through the deposition of reef-derived sediment during energetic events, the maximum
         vertical thickness of a storm or tsunami deposit is generally less than 10% and no
         more than 50% of the depth of the flooding seawater during the overwash event (
         <a><span>30</span></a>). Thus, wave-driven island overwash, subsequent flooding, and groundwater salinization
         (and saltwater intrusion) will continue to increase with SLR, despite any wave-driven
         sediment deposition. Although these islands may experience a variety of sediment deposition
         and/or migration patterns, including the maintenance of their lateral extents, because
         of the loss of freshwater resources and the increased frequency of impacts to infrastructure,
         most of these islands will likely become uninhabitable in the near future, well before
         the end of the 21st century, as has been previously suggested (
         <a><span>8</span></a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Together, these results provide an improved and updated timeline of the threats that
         these low-lying atoll islands face to their infrastructure and natural resources in
         the face of future climate change. By incorporating wave-driven overwash into future
         predictions, we demonstrate the immediacy of the threats and underscore the urgency
         for planning and action. The next step is to use these results and those from theoretical
         simulations covering the range of reef island morphologies and climate forcing conditions
         to identify individual islands that are most vulnerable to SLR and then gauge the
         associated impacts to those islands over the next 20 to 50 years so that managers
         can prioritize funding for further place-based studies and/or restoration and adaptation
         efforts (
         <a><span>11</span></a>, 
         <a><span>31</span></a>). Although there are a number of engineering solutions to increase the resilience
         of infrastructure and food and water resources that could be used to help the islands
         adapt to climate change and extend their habitability, these solutions in remote areas
         generally have such high costs that most islands cannot afford them. This information
         will also be critical to political leaders, not only of island nations but also globally,
         for understanding how climate change will determine when these islands will no longer
         be able to support human habitation, resulting in an extensive displacement of human
         populations. If these impacts are not addressed or adequately planned for, as it becomes
         necessary to abandon or relocate island nations, then significant geopolitical issues
         could arise.
