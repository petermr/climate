      <div>The projected spatial extent of inundation due to SLR and annual flooding due to the
         combined effects of waves and SLR on Roi through time for different SLR and climatic
         scenarios.

         annual large wave events increase into the future because of SLR and with increasing
         RCP scenario; the island is completely overwashed annually by wave-driven flooding
         later in the 21st century for RCP8.5 scenarios.
