 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary goal of this investigation was to determine the influence of climate change and SLR on wave-driven flooding and the resulting impacts to infrastructure and freshwater resources on atoll islands. First, we mapped the morphology and benthic habitats of the atoll to determine the influence of spatially varying bathymetric structure and hydrodynamic roughness on wave propagation over the coral reefs that made up the atoll. Second, we analyzed historic meteorologic and oceanographic data to provide historical context for the limited in situ data and comparison to previous seawater overwash and flooding events. These data were then used to calibrate and validate physics-based, dynamically downscaled numerical models to project future atmospheric and oceanic forcing for a range of climate change scenarios. Third, we made in situ observations to better understand how changes in meteorologic and oceanographic forcing controlled wave-driven water levels, seawater flooding of the island, and the resulting hydrogeologic response. We then used those data to calibrate and validate physics-based, numerical hydrodynamic, and hydrogeologic models of the island. The hydrodynamic model was used to forecast future wave-driven island overwash and seawater flooding for a range of climate change and SLR scenarios. The output of those hydrodynamic simulations was then used as input to the hydrogeologic model to evaluate the impact of projected wave-driven flooding on the atoll island’s freshwater resource and at what rate the resource can recover. Last, we projected the tipping points—when the reoccurrence interval of island overwash and seawater intrusion events is shorter than the recovery times for the impact.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydrodynamic and hydrogeologic models needed to be run on a high-resolution, seamless topographic and bathymetric (TB) digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area. To create the TB-DEM, topographic data from Global Positioning System (GPS) and terrestrial lidar scanning (TLS) collected on the island were combined with bathymetry derived from satellite imagery. The topographic surveys of Roi were conducted using static Topcon GRS1 dual-frequency GPS and GPS rovers. TLS surveys were conducted using a Riegl VZ-1000 tripod-based lidar scanner placed at 31 locations on the island. Data point cloud cleaning and filtering were performed on the registered point clouds to produce a subset of ground measurements suitable for constructing a bare-earth DEM. Because of the lack of high-resolution bathymetric data for the study area, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 multispectral satellite imagery were used to derive bathymetry (

    <span class="italic">32</span>
   </a>). Depths on the ocean side were a combination of depths generated from the model down to 22.5 m; past that, depths were taken from an interpolated surface from fathometer measurements. A 3 × 3 low-pass convolution filter was used on the final product to eliminate single-pixel anomalies. To create the seamless TB-DEM of Roi-Namur, TLS, GPS, and satellite-derived bathymetry were combined into a 0.5-m grid. For the island and intertidal reef flat areas, TLS and GPS data were combined into a triangulated irregular network model. Because of the higher data density, TLS data were used preferentially over GPS and satellite-derived bathymetry wherever it was available. To produce the final seamless 0.5-m resolution TB-DEM, the onshore and offshore grids were combined.

Benthic habitats were mapped using spectral classification with the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised clustering algorithm, in combination with on-screen, heads-up digitizing (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Land-cover data were needed to determine how much of any given land cover class would be inundated for a given future wave and sea-level scenario. Half-meter true-color and three-band color infrared satellite imagery were used as base layers to develop the terrestrial land-cover map. The ArcGIS Interactive Supervised Classification tool was used to delineate 15 distinct land-cover classes, and a majority filter was applied using eight closest cells. The result of the majority filter was a raster that was converted to polygons that were grouped by land-cover classification.</p>

Together, these observations elucidated the influence of water depth (as related to tidal and atmospheric forcing) on wave propagation and transformation across the atoll rim and over the reef flats for a range of oceanographic and meteorologic conditions. The 18-month field experiment consisted of three consecutive 6-month deployments in which two cross-shore arrays (

Each cross-shore array consisted of three bottom-mounted RBR wave/tide gauges over the reef flat and one on the upper fore reef. Between the two adjacent transects, an upward-looking 600-kHz Nortek Acoustic Wave and Current meter was placed on the fore reef. In addition, to capture wave and tidal conditions in the lagoon, an RBR wave/tide gauge and an RBR tide gauge were placed on a dock pier.

The XBEACH model was calibrated and validated by comparing modeled and measured wave and water-level data from the December 2013 and March 2014 large wave events.

    <span class="italic">35</span>
   </a>) provides a unique opportunity to examine the ability of global models to accurately represent climate, both in terms of future predictions and the observed long-term trends in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions over recent decades. Historical simulations (1971–2005) were used to assess the models’ ability to realistically simulate the annual mean precipitation, winds, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and their annual cycles. On the basis of a suite of metrics, five models that demonstrated high skills (“best”) in representing the present-day climatology and variability (table S3) were selected from the larger pool of 41 GCMs for detailed analyses. Then, for the five best GCMs, their skill in capturing interannual variations in seasonal rainfall during rainy seasons was examined. Finally, mean annual changes in rainfall, SST, and winds from the five best GCMs were used for future projections. Although CMIP5 global models do not adequately simulate the intensity of fully developed tropical cyclones (TCs), the genesis and the early life of TCs, in these models over the west Pacific were evaluated, and the statistical properties of these storms around Kwajalein were quantified. The TRACK program (

A 3D finite-element model of variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport in the island aquifer was created using the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) SUTRA groundwater model (

For this model, the SUTRA code was modified to account for water table storage by including the aquifer-specific yield in the governing equations. The SUTRA model was calibrated and validated using observations from a December 2008 wave-driven overwash and flooding event on Roi-Namur.

   </a>). These simulations take into account various stages of higher sea level, estimated saltwater ponding over the surface of Roi, and natural recharge of wells via rainfall. The annual wave events derived from the future oceanographic flood modeling were used to drive overwash. Then, following these overwash events, the temporal evolution of the freshwater-lens seawater contamination (chloride concentrations relative to potability levels) was simulated with the same groundwater pumping rate and timing as occurred in the years following the 2008 flooding event. Future recharge (2080–2099) was estimated using rainfall and evapotranspiration based on future climate modeling of the RCP8.5 scenario. Modeled climate data were processed for historic (1990–2009) and future (2080–2099, RCP8.5) conditions to compute mean monthly change factors for rainfall amount, number of rain days, and reference evapotranspiration to compute recharge for future conditions.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Future sea levels and worst-case annual seawater flooding scenarios were estimated as described in the “Wave-driven flood modeling” section. SLR scenarios of +0.4, +0.8, +1.2, and +1.6 m (RCP8.5 estimates of SLR at Roi-Namur in 2035, 2055, 2075, and 2090, respectively) and the associated annual wave-driven flooding were simulated. For each scenario, the coastline of the island was reduced accordingly on the basis of island topography, and then the estimated maximum seawater flooding distribution was applied to the model for a 2-day period each year. The response of the freshwater lens was evaluated on the basis of how the salinity (chloride concentration) of water at the skimming well changed during the recovery time period. Under some climatic scenarios, it was necessary to carry out these simulations for several years after a single overwash event so that the full duration of the lens recovery could be resolved. Finally, simulations of three consecutive years of annual overwash and flooding events during dry, average, and wet recharge conditions with representative withdrawal patterns for each year were completed.</p>
