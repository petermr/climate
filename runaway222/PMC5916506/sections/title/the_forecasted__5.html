      <div>The forecasted impact of annual wave-driven flooding events on groundwater potability
         over 3 years for +0.4 m of SLR.
      </div>
      <p>Plot shows the modeled evolution of chloride concentrations relative to the 250-mg/liter
         potability threshold. Within 2 years of annual flooding with +0.4 m of SLR, the island’s
         groundwater is no longer potable because of seawater contamination.
