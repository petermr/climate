      <p>Sea levels are rising, with the highest rates in the tropics, where thousands of low-lying
         coral atoll islands are located. Most studies on the resilience of these islands to
         sea-level rise have projected that they will experience minimal inundation impacts
         until at least the end of the 21st century. However, these have not taken into account
         the additional hazard of wave-driven overwash or its impact on freshwater availability.
         We project the impact of sea-level rise and wave-driven flooding on atoll infrastructure
         and freshwater availability under a variety of climate change scenarios. We show that,
         on the basis of current greenhouse gas emission rates, the nonlinear interactions
         between sea-level rise and wave dynamics over reefs will lead to the annual wave-driven
         overwash of most atoll islands by the mid-21st century. This annual flooding will
         result in the islands becoming uninhabitable because of frequent damage to infrastructure
         and the inability of their freshwater aquifers to recover between overwash events.
         This study provides critical information for understanding the timing and magnitude
         of climate change impacts on atoll islands that will result in significant, unavoidable
         geopolitical issues if it becomes necessary to abandon and relocate low-lying island
         states.
