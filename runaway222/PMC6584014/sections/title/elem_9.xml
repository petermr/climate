  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original version of the SAQ-A questionnaire was translated from English to Norwegian following modified principles adapted from Beaton et al [
   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref027">27</a>]. Based on a back-translated version, an expert committee made adjustments to avoid misunderstandings and adapt the questionnaire to the Norwegian nursing home setting. For instance, the original SAQ-A statement “Medical errors are handled appropriately in this office” was changed to “Medical errors are handled appropriately in this nursing home ward”, and “Nurse input is well received in this office” was changed to “Staff input is well received in this nursing home ward”. The pre-final version was evaluated by a group of health care providers in nursing homes. Based on their feedback, the final version of the Norwegian SAQ-A questionnaire for nursing homes was developed.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Data were collected in February 2016. Information about the study was presented on posters in the nursing home wards and in handouts to all participants prior to–and during–the data collection. Key administrative persons in the nursing homes distributed a paper version of the SAQ-A to the employees, and reminded them one week before deadline. It took approximately 15 minutes to complete the SAQ-A. We did include part-time workers, however, as this was a study on safety climate amongst employees, we excluded those working in very small positions ≤ 20%. To ensure confidentiality, filled-in questionnaires were returned anonymously in boxes placed in the nursing home wards. Questionnaires were scanned into an SPSS data file for analysis.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To protect the confidentiality of the respondents, feedback reports were only produced for wards with five respondents or more.</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SAQ-A is a 62-item questionnaire where respondents rate their agreement using a five-point Likert scale. Before analysis, scores of negatively worded items were reversed, so that higher scores in the data set always indicate a more positive evaluation of the unit’s patient safety climate. 
   <a rid="pone.0218244.t001" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0218244.t001">Table 1</a> presents 28 of 62 items of the SAQ-A for nursing homes, which corresponds to the measurement model of SAQ which has been tested and validated in a previous study [
   <a rid="pone.0218244.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0218244.ref025">25</a>]. Items in the SAQ-A not covered by the six factors in the original model were kept in the questionnaire because they considered useful for local improvement processes and discussions. Factor scores for each individual respondent were computed as (mean value of item scores that belong to the factor—1) *25, so that the score”1” is transformed to”0”,”2” to”25”,”3” to”50”,”4” to”75”, and”5” to”100”.
