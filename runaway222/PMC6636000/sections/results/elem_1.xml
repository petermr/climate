  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> presents participants’ demographics. In all, 106 HCPs in the selected primary healthcare clinics were recruited based on their availability and demographic characteristics. This was to obtain the maximum variation of characteristics of the clinics’ total make-ups. For the purpose of analysis, only four of the five relevant CFIR domains were used for this paper.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Table 
   <a rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" href="#Tab2">2</a> summarises the details of 20 constructs and sub-constructs from the four selected CFIR domains that the HCPs perceived as positive or negative in their clinic environment and setting. The presence of positive perceptions was more likely to facilitate change in implementing new interventions. Negative presence was a perceived barrier and challenge for change implementation. During preliminary analysis, ‘non-compliance to appointment’ and ‘non-compliance to treatment management’ seemed to fit a new construct that was initially labelled as ‘Patient’s Behaviour’, which was not in the CFIR. After long deliberation, codes in this new construct were re-fitted into CFIR’s ‘Patients and Resources’ construct.

Several challenges were perceived as barriers for introducing a new intervention under the domains of intervention characteristics, outer and inner setting. Despite these challenges, HCPs expressed openness to any new intervention for enhancing the NCD care management. Their readiness to change was based on their experience in managing their clinics and their personal insight of their clinic settings that may facilitate the implementation of new intervention.

   <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Only one out of eight constructs for intervention characteristics emerged, with ‘Design Quality and Packaging’ highlighted as a facilitator. The availability of several activities (such as family doctor concept, community health empowerment programme and clinic appointment system) related to NCD management can facilitate the proposed plan for enhancing the NCD services and strengthen the suggestion for dedicated NCD care management teams in primary healthcare settings.</p>
  </sec>
  <sec id="Sec10" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Outer setting</div>
   <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The outer setting has four constructs that refer to factors outside of the organisation. Three out of the four constructs (‘Patient Needs and Resources’, ‘Cosmopolitanism’ and ‘External Policies and Incentives’) were noted to have possible barriers. In contrast, clinic location and good networking with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community were seen as possible facilitators for implementing a new NCD programme. However, the perception of clinic location and accessibility as facilitators may vary depending on the facility location.</p>
   <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Patients’ non-compliance with appointment times was perceived as a barrier, especially among elderly patients who depend on their children for transportation. Consequently, the clinics’ current implementation of a time-slot appointment system (referred to as the ‘staggered appointment system’) did not run as intended. Additionally, HCPs noticed that the patients and the surrounding community have limited comprehension on the clinics’ role; they believed that patients perceived clinics as a curative centre rather than a place for learning about health. Professionals among the HCPs commonly recommended restructuring patients’ beliefs about the clinics’ role.</p>
   <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The construct of ‘Cosmopolitanism’ assessed the degree to which an organisation is networked with other external organisations. Lack of inter-health facility networking was perceived as a barrier in information transfer between primary healthcare clinics and hospitals, which affected patients’ care continuity. This challenge became more prominent when NCD patients who were discharged from hospitals were asked to continue their chronic care management in the primary care facilities within their localities. Nevertheless, the HCPs shared that the presence of good networking and relationships with other external organisations such as NGOs and other ministries were viewed as an advantage for interventions that require external support. For example, the community health empowerment programmes such as 
    <span class="italic">Komuniti Sihat Perkasa Negara</span> (KOSPEN) [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>], was viewed as a good platform to introduce any preventive or health education activities.
   </p>
   <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another barrier perceived by the HCPs was under the construct for ‘External Policies and Incentives’. It is related to mandates from top management that could sometimes be a challenge, especially for ad hoc directives that require urgent/immediate action. This often affected task prioritisation over on-going programmes, which has a further negative impact when the clinic has existing issues with insufficient resources. The participants shared this dilemma because they were concerned that the proposed new intervention will be implemented as an additional directive without proper planning or realignment with existing activities.</p>

  <sec id="Sec11" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inner setting</div>
   <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This domain consisted of five constructs with nine sub-constructs within the organisational context. Several barriers and facilitators were raised within the primary healthcare clinics’ context that covered all five constructs. Under the construct of Structural ‘Characteristic’, the constraint of clinic physical space was a concern that the HCPs raised. Facility upgrade was deemed crucial, as well as clinic resources, which largely have remained similar to when the clinic was first set up. This would prove challenging especially with the ever-increasing patient attendance that which is due to local population growth around the clinic. Resource issues will be elaborated within the sub-construct of ‘Available Resources’ under the ‘Readiness for Implementation’ construct. Good networking and communication within the clinic facilitates internal information relay regarding clarifications and issues requiring attention. HCPs in clinics that initiated morning briefings felt that the routine communication method boosts their morale and spirit to work.</p>
   <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Culture’ as a construct within inner setting is an important component in assessing organisational receptiveness and openness to new intervention. HCPs expressed that the culture of teamwork and helping one another had been established within the clinic. HCPs also shared that the sense of belonging to the clinic and professionalism were critical foundations for a strong internal teamwork. However, they were concerned that certain clinics have the culture of working in silos. It does not happen in all clinics, but they think that the concern warrants ministerial-level attention before it gets worse.</p>
   <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the ‘Implementation Climate’ construct, issues on barriers and facilitators were identified under five sub-constructs: ‘Tension to Change’, ‘Compatibility’, ‘Relative Priority’, ‘Organisation Incentives and Rewards’, and ‘Learning Climate’.</p>
   <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ‘Tension for Change’ sub-construct assessed the stakeholders’ perception of the current situation as intolerable or needing change [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. HCPs reflected on issues that triggered change and the clinics’ current situation. However, certain clinics viewed the patient influx as an opportunity for early detection and screenings, which may be a facilitator for enhancing NCD care management. The increasing clinic attendance also raised concerns among the doctors, who felt less time was spent with patients so as to not cause longer waiting times for patients-in-queue, causing comprehensive assessment and health education to be delivered inadequately. Regarding issues of unstandardised and disorganised workflow, HCPs shared their perception of the issues, their suggestions and attempted solutions in previous programme implementations. However, HCPs identified aspects in the current setting that demanded change, required strengthening or were perceived as intolerable. With regards to documentation strengthening, data entry for routine monthly returns has been done manually instead of computerised, which led to ‘Tension for Change’.
   </p>
   <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, the challenges under the ‘Compatibility’ construct were raised. Referrals received from other MOH community screening programmes such as KOSPEN facilitated the clinics’ community screening activity. It was noted that there were no proper patient tracking mechanism in place after patients have been screened for NCD, which hinders efforts to establish person-centred care. Those who have been identified with medium and high risk by the screening activities may default clinic appointments for further management, hence, the lack of tracking mechanism results in the at-risk population to be left untreated until they actually require treatment. Hence, HCPs perceived proper documentation and establishment of a robust tracking mechanism as crucial to achieve person-centred care.</p>
   <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the ‘Relative Priority’ construct, the practice of family doctor concept was found to be a positive asset that could facilitate the proposed EnPHC initiative. This concept established one doctor and a team attending to the same patient to ensure care continuity, allowing them to have a better understanding of their patients’ health status and treatment.</p>
   <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A conducive ‘Learning Climate’ (a sub-construct under the ‘Implementation Climate’ construct) within the clinic encouraged staff to contribute ideas and opinions for service delivery improvements. Many HCPs expressed this view during the exploration on readiness. Acknowledgement of the ideas and opinions, and establishing avenues for discussion by the leader were seen as factors that create positive clinic environment in problem-solving activities.</p>
   <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Readiness for Implementation’ is another construct within the ‘Inner Setting’ domain that was defined as immediate indicators of organisational commitment to implement a new intervention. One of its sub-constructs is ‘Leadership Engagement’, which emphasise the leader’s role in an organisation. Approachable and dedicated leaders were viewed as catalysts for a successful intervention in which they are able to comprehend the programmes’ goals and successfully relay information to their staff. In other words, clinic staffs perceived that leadership’s willingness to participate and solve daily clinic issues established a strong support system within the clinic, consequently promoting staffs’ openness and readiness for any challenge.</p>
   <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Available Resources’ is a sub-construct highlighted during the FGDs. Regardless of the HCP’s enthusiasm towards change, resource availability was critical in determining the level of staffs’ readiness. Resources covered a substantial range of aspects from operational components such as training and funding, to organisational components such as buildings, equipment and staffing. There was a near-consensus among all participants on the need for additional staff and upgraded facilities to implement any new programme or interventions. HCPs shared that logistics was a challenge because most clinics only have one official vehicle, which was always in use. This forced the clinic staff to resort to using their own transportation despite the rare reimbursement from the respective district health offices.</p>
   <p id="Par41" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sub-construct ‘Access to Knowledge and Information’ or ease of access to information within the primary healthcare clinic was not an issue because the guideline or procedure was always available for reference, especially for NCD care management. However, not all programmes introduced in the clinic came with full implementation guidelines. One clinic shared that the introduction of the family doctor concept in their clinic was not provided with sufficient information or guidelines for implementation.</p>

  <sec id="Sec12" class="sec">
   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Individual characteristics</div>
   <p id="Par42" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the ‘Individual Characteristics’ domain, all five constructs were found to have a positive presence that could be facilitators. Implementers’ ‘Knowledge and Belief about the Implementation’ is a crucial construct because previous study reported change created uncertainties and fear of the impending unknown [
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>] under individual characteristics. However, in this study, the HCPs expressed their expectation of improved overall health outcomes among patients with the proposed new intervention for NCD management. The ‘Self-efficacy’ construct was another facilitator as HCPs concurred that staff capability to execute tasks for NCD management was crucial since they are the key personnel who will be involved directly with the proposed intervention.
   </p>
   <p id="Par43" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">‘Individual Stage of Change’ depicts the manner in which HCPs embrace and accept new ideas for improvement, which denotes readiness. Ready HCPs are often open to new ideas, which they view as key to improve existing programmes. This type of mental readiness allows acceptance of new or untested methods to be easily implemented versus a non-ready HCP who would openly resist changes. Meanwhile, HCPs identified ‘Individual Identification with Organisation’ as their commitment to implementing MOH-driven programmes. One participant declared that any task assigned is a responsibility that must be executed despite the time needed to figure things out.</p>
   <p id="Par44" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other personal attributes such as motivation and individual positive attitudes contributed towards acceptance of previously implemented programmes. Some HCPs strongly believed the best care for patients must be provided for their good health outcomes. This reflected their professionalism and value, which could be facilitators for implementing new programmes or interventions.</p>
