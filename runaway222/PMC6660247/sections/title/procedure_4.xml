 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: temperature condition (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 104) or neutral condition (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 103). In the temperature condition, participants viewed the graph of annual global temperature change. In a descriptive paragraph above the graph, participants were informed that the graph showed the annual global temperature change from 1880 to 2013. There was no label for the x-axis or the y-axis. Participants were eyetracked when they were viewing the graph. Eye gaze was tracked using an SMI RED-250 Mobile Eyetracking System (60 Hz). Each participant was seated 50 cm from a computer monitor with a resolution of 1920 pixels × 1080 pixels. After seeing the graph, participants were asked to estimate the average global temperature change from 1880 to 2013. In the neutral condition, participants viewed the exact same graph but without any framing related to global temperature, and the x-axis and the y-axis were exactly same as in the temperature condition. In the descriptive paragraph above the graph, participants were informed that the graph showed some value change from 1880 to 2013. Same as in the temperature condition, participants were eyetracked when they were viewing the graph. After seeing the graph, participants were asked to estimate the average value change from 1880 to 2013. After the estimation task, participants in both conditions provided their demographic information and rated their political orientation on an 11-point scale from −5 (very liberal, left-wing) to 5 (very conservative, right-wing). In our analysis, we divided participants into a liberal group (whose ratings on the political orientation scale were below 0) and a conservative group (whose ratings on the political orientation scale were above 0). In the temperature condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.36 (69 liberals and 21 conservatives). In the neutral condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −1.57 (69 liberals and 21 conservatives).
