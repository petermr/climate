 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Experiment 1 involved a sample of undergraduate students, therefore limiting the generalizability of the findings. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate Experiment 1 with a broader online sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using a novel attention-tracking technique called BubbleView. More importantly, this experiment aimed to examine how attentional biases were related to actions to mitigate climate change.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Participants</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A new group of 180 participants (58 females; mean age = 38.0 years, SD = 11.9) were recruited on MTurk. All participants gave informed consent and received US$0.25 each as compensation for participation. All participants were from the United States. Three participants who provided an estimation above or below 2.5 standard deviations of the group mean were excluded from the study, leaving a final sample of 177.</p>

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stimuli and Procedure</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The stimulus in this experiment was a graph showing annual global temperature, rather than temperature change as in the previous experiment. This was to ease the estimation of global temperature, as estimating average temperature change may be more difficult than estimating average temperature. Specifically, the graph showed the global annual mean surface air temperature in Celsius (°C) from 1880 to 2017 (

    <span class="sup">3</span>
   </a> provided by NASA. The graph was changed from land only to land and ocean to show a more representative view of the annual global temperature over years. The graph subtended 23.4° of visual angle in width (783 pixels) and 13.6° in height (450 pixels), assuming that participants were seated 50 cm from a computer monitor with a resolution of 1920 pixels × 1080 pixels.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in the previous experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the temperature condition (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 87) or the neutral condition (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 90). To measure participants’ attention, we used a novel online attention-tracking tool called BubbleView (adapted from 
   <a rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr" href="#ref25">Kim et al., 2017</a>). The entire graph, including the x-axis and the y-axis, was covered by a black mask, and only a small circular area around the mouse was transparent where the participant could see the underlying graph (see 
   <a rid="fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Participants were asked to move their mouse to see the content of the graph. The black mask was the same size as the graph. The transparent circular area subtended 1.2° of visual angle (diameter = 40 pixels). We tracked participants’ mouse location as a proxy for visual attention.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After viewing the graph, participants were asked to estimate the average global temperature (°C) in the temperature condition, or the average value in the neutral condition from 1880 to 2017. They were asked to provide an estimate between 13 and 16 (the bounds of the y-axis). After providing the estimates, participants were presented with a petition to stand with the Nature Conservancy to call on United States leaders to stand strong on climate change, and were asked whether they were willing to sign it. Participants also indicated whether they were willing to donate to Natural Resource Defense Council. The order of the petition and the donation question was random. If participants were willing to sign the pledge, they provided their name and email which were then forwarded to 
   <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://change.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">change.org</span>. If participants were willing to donate, they were asked to indicate the amount of donation (which was only hypothetical). At the end of the experiment, participants in both conditions provided their demographic information and rated their political orientation on the same 11-point scale. As in the previous experiment, we divided participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was −0.82 (47 liberals and 29 conservatives). In the neutral condition, the mean rating on the political orientation scale was 0.11 (32 liberals and 39 conservatives).

   <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BubbleView Results</div>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This experiment aimed to replicate the attentional results from Experiment 1 using the BubbleView technique. To measure attention, we calculated the number of mouse locations in each AOI (defined below). Since there was no time limit for participants to view the graph, we used the proportional number of mouse location, which was calculated as the number of mouse locations in each AOI divided by the total number of mouse locations on the graph.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to Experiment 1, we defined two AOIs on the temperature curve, one on the flat phase from 1880 to 1948 (subtending 8.3° of visual angle in width, 274 pixels, and 3.6° in height, 120 pixels), another on the rising phase from 1949 to 2017 (subtending 7.7° of visual angle in width, 254 pixels, and 5.2° in height, 170 pixels). We adjusted the AOIs from Experiment 1 because this graph was slightly different from the graph in Experiment 1, as it contained both land and ocean data, whereas the one in Experiment 1 contained only land data. This means that there was a small peak of global temperature around 1945 in the current graph, whereas the curve in Experiment 1 was relatively flat before 1980. For this reason, we tried to divide the curve into two halves (with the year 1949 being the mid-point), and the second half of the temperature curve was defined as the rising phase, which was steeper than the first half of the curve defined as the flat phase.</p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We first examined the relationship between political orientation and attention. This time, we did not find a correlation between political orientation and the proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase in the temperature condition [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(85) = 0.07, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.49] or in the neutral condition [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(88) = −0.03, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.81]. This did not replicate the numerical trend in Experiment 1. We further divided the participants into a liberal group and a conservative group. In the temperature condition, same as in Experiment 1, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = 0.12, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.44] or conservatism [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(27) = 0.09, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.64]. In the neutral condition, we did not find any correlation between attention on the graph and the degree of liberalism [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(30) = −0.10, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.58] or conservatism [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(37) = 0.20, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.22].
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then examined the relationship between attention and temperature estimation. In the temperature condition, we found that greater proportional number of mouse location in the rising phase relative to the flat phase was positively correlated with higher estimate of temperature [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(85) = 0.34, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.001], but no correlation was found in the neutral condition [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(88) = −0.10, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.37]. This result replicated the findings in Experiment 2, suggesting that more attention to the rising phase relative to the flat phase of the temperature curve (i.e., more salient evidence of climate change) was associated with higher estimations of global temperature.
   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The heatmaps of the average density of mouse location on the graph for liberals and conservatives are shown in 
    <a rid="fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. The heatmap of the average dwell time for independents (whose ratings on the political orientation scale were 0) in the temperature condition is shown in 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" href="#SM2">Section B of Supplementary Materials</a>. In the temperature condition, liberals who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase provided marginally higher estimates of temperature [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(45) = 0.28, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.054], and the same marginal correlation was found for conservatives [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(27) = 0.35, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.06]. In the neutral condition, no correlation was found for liberals [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(30) = 0.10, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.59] or conservatives [
    <span class="italic">r</span>(37) = −0.25, 
    <span class="italic">p</span> = 0.13]. These results suggest that both liberals and conservatives who focused more on the rising phase relative to the flat phase tended to provide a higher estimation of global temperature, which partially replicated Experiment 1 in which we found that liberals who focused more on the rising phase showed significantly higher perceived temperature, but this correlation was only marginal for conservatives.
