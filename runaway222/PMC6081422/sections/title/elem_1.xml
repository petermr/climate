  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the seesaw simulations, the temperature response of the Arctic is dominated by the sign of the heat flux imposed on the North Pacific, such that an increase in North Pacific heat flux and SST results in an increase in Arctic temperature, despite an equivalent heat flux into the ocean imposed on the North Atlantic (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). The NP-Cool/NA-Warm simulation results in Arctic cooling (−1.88 ± 0.14°C) and sea-ice advance (+4.07 ± 0.21% of total ice fraction), as well as a global cooling of −0.39 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation, despite an initial perturbation of 0 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in the global mean. The NP-Warm/NA-Cool simulation results in an overall more heterogeneous response, with a mean Arctic warming of +0.34 ± 0.22°C and a mean global temperature change of −0.03 ± 0.03°C relative to the control simulation. The difference in the magnitude of the Arctic climate impacts between these simulations in part reflects the non-linear response to positive and negative ocean heat fluxes. Negative perturbations result in a greater temperature response (both globally and in the Arctic) than equivalent positive heat flux anomalies, as can be seen in the single-basin positive/negative heat flux simulations (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>; Table

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To elucidate the mechanisms by which the North Pacific dominates the Arctic temperature response, we evaluate the climate feedbacks involved in the single-basin heat flux experiments. The additional ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux of +1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> global-equivalent from the North Pacific (NP-Warm) results in annual surface temperature increases ranging from 0.5 to 6°C across the entire northern hemisphere, with warming concentrated across the North Pacific Ocean and Arctic (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Annual-mean Arctic sea ice is reduced by 7.36 ± 0.54% relative to the control simulation, with the greatest decline focused along the sea-ice edge in the Greenland and Barents Seas and in the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Surface warming is most pronounced in winter months (December–February) and is amplified along the North Atlantic sea-ice edge and northern Siberia (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>), where surface temperature anomalies reach 6–7°C in winter. The mean global and Arctic temperature anomalies in the NP-Warm simulation are +0.95 ± 0.03 and +3.08 ± 0.20°C, respectively.
  </p>
  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Overall, the NA-Warm simulation elicits a more muted northern hemisphere warming compared to the NP-Warm simulation, with reduced surface warming in the Arctic, Northeastern Pacific, and North American continent. Annual-mean SSTs increase by 5–6°C near the region of modified heat flux, with smaller magnitudes of warming seen elsewhere in the northern hemisphere (0.5–3°C) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>). Annual-mean sea-ice area decreases by 4.98 ± 0.56% relative to the control simulation, with the greatest decline in the Beaufort Sea, along the perimeter of northern Alaska. The mean global and Arctic temperature anomalies in the NA-Warm simulation are +0.79 ± 0.02 and +2.12 ± 0.20°C, respectively.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sea-ice and low-cloud response</div>
  <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, Arctic sea-ice decline is most pronounced in regions with the greatest increase in low-cloud formation. Low clouds can be both a consequence and cause of sea-ice decline. Low clouds exert two opposing effects on the surface radiation budget; firstly, the enhanced albedo of cloud droplets decreases surface absorption of incoming shortwave radiation, and secondly, low clouds reduce outgoing longwave radiation
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
   </span>. Low-cloud formation in the subpolar extratropics results in a net surface cooling through the first mechanism. In the Arctic, however, enhanced low-cloud formation results in an overall surface warming effect in winter, spring, and autumn due to the second mechanism
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>
   </span>. The net change in the cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere may still be negative at high latitudes as a result of reflected incoming shortwave feedback and cloud brightening in response to increasing temperature
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span>, however, we focus here on the net radiative effects at the surface, given the influences on Arctic surface temperature and sea-ice extent.
  </p>
  <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seasonal trends in sea-ice reveal a strong correlation between sea-ice decline and low-cloud formation, as the two patterns covary in all seasons except summer, when the radiative effect of low clouds reverses sign (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>, 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The retreat of sea-ice has been shown to promote low-cloud formation through latent heat release and evaporation at the surface
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>; thus these two processes are likely coupled and reinforce one another. A linear regression of the change in sea-ice area and vertically integrated low-cloud fraction shows a high negative correlation between these variables in our simulations (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In all simulations, increased ocean heat fluxes to the atmosphere drive decreases in mid-latitude cloud cover; changes of opposite sign in heat flux have effects of the opposite sign in cloud cover (Figs. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> and 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). In both the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulation, the reduction in low clouds over the extratropical oceans increases shortwave absorption, further warming the sea surface and overlying air, decreasing relative humidity and increasing atmospheric moisture content that can be transported poleward.
  </p>
  <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Within the Arctic, the NP-Warm simulation increases the low-cloud formation more (+12.4 ± 0.89%) than the NA-Warm simulation (+9.5 ± 0.87%). The effect of low clouds accounts for an additional 2.9 ± 0.22 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> of surface longwave radiative forcing within the Arctic for the NP-Warm simulation versus an additional 2.2 ± 0.22 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in the NA-warm simulation (calculated as the difference in downwelling longwave radiation at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions). Clear-sky downwelling longwave radiation also increases more strongly in the NP-Warm case (10.7 ± 0.71 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) than in the NA-Warm case (7.3 ± 0.69 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>). The enhanced longwave radiation contributes to surface warming and sea-ice retreat, increasing the net shortwave radiation absorbed at the sea surface through the reduction in surface albedo (+1.7 ± 0.42 and 0.9 ± 0.37 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively).

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decompositions of the total northward atmospheric energy transport into the dry static energy (sensible heat and geopotential energy terms) and moist (latent heat term) energy terms indicate that the total atmospheric northward energy transport into the Arctic is larger in the NP-Warm case (0.054 PW) than in the NA-Warm Case (0.043 PW), and that this difference is primarily driven by a larger increase in northward latent energy transport in the NP-Warm case (0.081 PW) than in the NA-Warm case (0.068 PW) (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). The increase in northward latent energy transport is partially offset by a decrease in dry static energy transport that is similar between the NP-Warm (−0.028 PW) and NA-Warm (−0.025 PW) cases. This translates to a total of 2.6 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> of direct Arctic heating from atmospheric energy convergence in the NP-Warm case and 2.1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> in the NA-Warm case. Analysis of the longitudinal distribution of the northward latent energy transport along the Arctic boundary indicates the dominant regions that this latent energy is entering the Arctic in each case (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5b</a>). In both the NA-Warm and NP-Warm cases, the total latent heat transport (i.e., amount of moisture intrusion) is enhanced across the Pacific and Atlantic basins relative to the control. The NP-Warm simulation shows a greater total latent heat transfer across the Arctic boundary through the Atlantic gateway, whereas the NA-Warm simulation shows greater total latent heat transfer over Siberia, relative to the NP-Warm case.

  <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A further decomposition of the total atmosphere-integrated latent energy transport into the mean and eddy components show that the longitudinal structure of the change in total transport follows the change in mean transport (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The eddy transport term shows different longitudinal patterns for each case, with the NP-Warm case resulting in greater eddy transport across the North Pacific and North American continent, whereas the NA-Warm case shows an increase in eddy transport across most latitudes except the Northwestern Pacific and eastern North American continent. The longitudinal integral of each term indicates that the mean and eddy changes contribute 22.9 and 77.1% of the total latent energy transport increase in the NA-Warm Case and 23.6 and 76.4% in the NP-Warm case.
