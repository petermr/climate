 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.0.4
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
  </span>), coupled to a slab ocean. The atmosphere and land components are simulated on a 0.9° × 1.5° grid, whereas the ice and ocean components are on an approximately 1° × 1° grid. A total of 12 simulations are conducted under preindustrial atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations (284.7 ppm) with various modifications to the ocean surface or mixed layer heat flux (Q-flux) and land topography (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).

 <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the routine available in the standard CESM download, which uses monthly oceanic fields of temperature, salinity, surface velocities, boundary layer depth, surface heat flux, melting and freezing fluxes to generate the Q-flux for a specific mixed layer depth. The mixed layer is an annual average to balance the seasonal cycle
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
  </span>. We use an 80-year average from a multi-millennia coupled control simulation with preindustrial forcing to generate a climatological reference state, which globally and annually average to a zero Q-flux. The annual net Q-flux is a small residual of a strong seasonal cycle, with the same pattern as the surface heat flux, only with a smaller amplitude. In the equilibrium state, the heat flux at the surface and mixed layer depth are the same, since the slab-ocean simulation does not allow lateral transport. The annual-mean climatological Q-flux compares well with observations and is dominated by tropical upwelling regions taking up heat and Western boundary currents, the Nordic seas, and the Southern Ocean releasing heat to the atmosphere

  </span>.

 <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then apply the globally non-zero Q-flux pattern as a negative (i.e., heat flux out of the mixed layer depth into the ocean) and positive (i.e., heat flux into atmosphere) ocean heat uptake forcing inducing a global warming and cooling. The idealized Q-flux anomaly patterns are sine-shaped functions being bound to zero at 30°N and 60°N and rising to a maximum value at 45°N. The global imbalance was tuned to +1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> and −1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> global-equivalent, which implies the Pacific local maximum is smaller (31.5 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) than the Atlantic local maximum (54 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), since the Pacific area is larger (Supplementary Figure 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We also configured a Q-flux anomaly for the North Pacific that was the equivalent area as the heat flux imposed on the North Atlantic to eliminate the potential effects of the different areas of the North Pacific and North Atlantic heat flux anomalies on global and Arctic climate. The local anomalous Q-flux is in the same order of magnitude as the climatological annual-mean flux, but smaller than the local seasonal cycle. The mixed layer depth is kept at the climatological control simulation annual average (spatially varying).

 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The naming convention for the simulations is as follows: NP-Warm (North Pacific +1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), NP-Cool (North Pacific −1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), NA-Warm (North Atlantic +1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>), NA-Cool (North Atlantic −1 W/m
  <span class="sup">2</span>) for the single-basin Q-flux perturbations, and NP-Warm/NA-Cool and NP-Cool/NA-Warm denoting the compensating “seesaw” Q-flux perturbations. Simulations were also run with the positive ocean-to-atmosphere Q-flux perturbations in each basin with modified land topography, such that the global land surface was set to a geopotential height of zero (NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo). A simulation was run with a positive heat flux imposed in the Northeast Pacific that was approximately equivalent to the area of the Atlantic heat flux (NEP-Warm).
