  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We employ simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.0.4
   <span class="sup">

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" href="#CR51">51</a>
   </span>), coupled to a slab ocean. The atmosphere and land components are simulated on a 0.9° × 1.5° grid, whereas the ice and ocean components are on an approximately 1° × 1° grid. A total of 12 simulations are conducted under preindustrial atmospheric CO
   <sub>2</sub> concentrations (284.7 ppm) with various modifications to the ocean surface or mixed layer heat flux (Q-flux) and land topography (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>).
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use the routine available in the standard CESM download, which uses monthly oceanic fields of temperature, salinity, surface velocities, boundary layer depth, surface heat flux, melting and freezing fluxes to generate the Q-flux for a specific mixed layer depth. The mixed layer is an annual average to balance the seasonal cycle
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>
   </span>. We use an 80-year average from a multi-millennia coupled control simulation with preindustrial forcing to generate a climatological reference state, which globally and annually average to a zero Q-flux. The annual net Q-flux is a small residual of a strong seasonal cycle, with the same pattern as the surface heat flux, only with a smaller amplitude. In the equilibrium state, the heat flux at the surface and mixed layer depth are the same, since the slab-ocean simulation does not allow lateral transport. The annual-mean climatological Q-flux compares well with observations and is dominated by tropical upwelling regions taking up heat and Western boundary currents, the Nordic seas, and the Southern Ocean releasing heat to the atmosphere
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
   </span>.
  </p>
  <p id="Par32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We then apply the globally non-zero Q-flux pattern as a negative (i.e., heat flux out of the mixed layer depth into the ocean) and positive (i.e., heat flux into atmosphere) ocean heat uptake forcing inducing a global warming and cooling. The idealized Q-flux anomaly patterns are sine-shaped functions being bound to zero at 30°N and 60°N and rising to a maximum value at 45°N. The global imbalance was tuned to +1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> and −1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> global-equivalent, which implies the Pacific local maximum is smaller (31.5 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) than the Atlantic local maximum (54 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>), since the Pacific area is larger (Supplementary Figure 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). We also configured a Q-flux anomaly for the North Pacific that was the equivalent area as the heat flux imposed on the North Atlantic to eliminate the potential effects of the different areas of the North Pacific and North Atlantic heat flux anomalies on global and Arctic climate. The local anomalous Q-flux is in the same order of magnitude as the climatological annual-mean flux, but smaller than the local seasonal cycle. The mixed layer depth is kept at the climatological control simulation annual average (spatially varying).
  </p>
  <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The naming convention for the simulations is as follows: NP-Warm (North Pacific +1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>), NP-Cool (North Pacific −1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>), NA-Warm (North Atlantic +1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>), NA-Cool (North Atlantic −1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) for the single-basin Q-flux perturbations, and NP-Warm/NA-Cool and NP-Cool/NA-Warm denoting the compensating “seesaw” Q-flux perturbations. Simulations were also run with the positive ocean-to-atmosphere Q-flux perturbations in each basin with modified land topography, such that the global land surface was set to a geopotential height of zero (NP-Warm-Notopo and NA-Warm-Notopo). A simulation was run with a positive heat flux imposed in the Northeast Pacific that was approximately equivalent to the area of the Atlantic heat flux (NEP-Warm).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Model output analysis</div>
  <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All simulations were run for 100 model years and annual and seasonal averages were calculated for years 40–100 of the model output, with the exception of the NEP-Warm simulation, which was run for 60 model years with mean values calculated from years 40 to 60. Reported errors are calculated as the standard error of the mean multiplied by 1.96, which is the number of standard deviations required to contain 95% of the area of a normal distribution. The calculation of the standard error of the mean assumes a sample size of 
   <span class="italic">N</span> independent samples, which in our case are the individual model years. Autocorrelation between model years, however, reduces the number of independent samples, as described by Santer et al.
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>
   </span> This autocorrelation is corrected for by using Eq. (6) of Santer et al.

   </span> to determine an “effective sample size”,

   <sub>e</sub>, that adjusts the original sample size for this autocorrelation.
  </p>
  <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We calculate the global climate feedback parameter (
   <span class="italic">α</span>) as 
   <span class="italic">F</span>/Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>, where 
   <span class="italic">F</span> is the applied global radiative forcing (±1 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span>) and Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span> is the change in global average surface air temperature
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
   </span>. The Arctic amplification factor is calculated as the ratio of the change in global surface air temperature to the change in Arctic surface air temperature (Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>global</sub>/Δ
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>arctic</sub>) (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The cloud radiative forcing at the TOA is calculated as the difference in the net radiative flux between all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The greenhouse effect of clouds in the Arctic is calculated as the difference in the downwelling longwave radiation at the surface between all-sky and clear-sky conditions
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
   </span>. We calculate the surface albedo forcing related to changes in sea-ice as the difference in upwelling shortwave radiation at the surface in clear-sky conditions. However, the enhanced absorption of shortwave radiation at the surface due to sea-ice retreat is in part compensated by enhanced shortwave reflection at the TOA due to changes in Arctic cloudiness. For example, the greater increase in Arctic cloud fraction in the NP-Warm contributes to an annual-mean negative cloud radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) (−2.0 ± 0.36 and −1.7 ± 0.26 W/m
   <span class="sup">2</span> for the NP-Warm and NA-Warm simulations, respectively). However, this is composed of a positive cloud radiative effect from trapped longwave in winter—when the maximum Arctic warming occurs—and a negative cloud radiative effect from reflected shortwave in the summer, during which season the decreased albedo from sea-ice loss more than compensates for the increased cloud reflection. Thus, the warming effect of low clouds and sea-ice retreat together more than compensate for the reduction in incoming shortwave at the TOA due to enhanced cloud albedo.
  </p>
  <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The net change in shortwave radiation at the surface is interpreted as the effective shortwave absorption due to both cloud and sea-ice changes. Moisture convergence in the Arctic is defined as precipitation minus the surface water flux. Changes in Arctic sea-ice and cloud fraction are reported as the percent change in the area fraction relative to the control simulation. All calculations for the Arctic are defined as north of 66.6°.</p>
