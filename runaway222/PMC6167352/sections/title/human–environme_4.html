      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model results suggest that the end of the Holocene AHP was delayed by around 500
         years. A logical extension from the hypothesis of anthropogenically-driven early collapse
         <span><a>2</a></span> is that humans caused this delay. Whilst other possible explanations could exist,
         the main difference between the Holocene and previous interglacials is the existence
         of Human society in the Holocene. We therefore explore whether mechanisms exist that
         may explain an anthropogenic role in the collapse, by focusing on why pastoralism
         is sustainable. This approach rejects any dualist view that humans occupy a unique
         place in nature
         <span><a>35</a></span>, advocating instead the historical dependencies between human action and environmental
         change
         <span><a>36</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mobility, a distinguishing feature of traditional pastoral systems
         <span><a>37</a></span>, results in periodicity of the intensity of grazing. Grasslands can suffer from undergrazing
         as much as overgrazing
         <span><a>4</a>,
            <a>6</a></span>, so active management of grazing plays a major role in grassland health. This is
         because grazing ungulates and grasslands have co-evolved from an historical predator-prey
         relationship, with pack hunting predators keeping large herds of ungulates bunched
         and moving
         <span><a>38</a></span>. Healthy grasslands are maintained in precisely this way by pastoralists bunching
         stock and moving them frequently, fostering a mutually beneficial distribution of
         dung and urine
         <span><a>37</a></span>. Removing grazers from grasslands increases the amount of senescent vegetation, which
         causes the grasses to cease growing productively
         <span><a>39</a></span>. Grazing livestock and their preference for the most palatable grasses provide a
         competitive advantage to the less palatable grasses for water and nutrients, making
         it important to get the balance correct between overgrazing and over-resting. Traditional
         pastoralists tend to be acutely aware of these subtle dynamics utilising practices
         that maximise grassland regeneration
         <span><a>38</a>,
            <a>40</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence from long-term studies on herding strategies has also helped to reveal the
         sensitive dynamic between drought, pasture availability, and herd size. Seasonal and
         long-term droughts, which are common in areas of pastoral rangeland, as well as disease
         dynamics, control the growth of herds in a way that means they are unlikely to damage
         pasture. If longer-term drought starts to restrict pasture, or if herd size increases
         beyond the carrying capacity of a rangeland, then pastoralists will move on. For example,
         field research in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area has shown that whilst pastures
         were being overgrazed in terms of optimal commercial yield, this did not result in
         environmental degradation
         <span><a>41</a></span>. This is important as it suggests that animal condition deteriorates before they
         are capable of having a seriously deleterious effect on the environment. The amount
         of pastoralism practiced by the Saharan occupants, and therefore the size of their
         herds, are unlikely to have reached such levels as to surpass carrying capacity. The
         inherent mobility and customary institutions employed by these populations generates
         a dynamic state of adaptation, which logically negates over-burdening pastoral rangeland
         <span><a>5</a></span>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent publication by Wright
         <span><a>2</a></span> in which mid-Holocene pastoralists are considered “catalysts in accelerating the
         pace of devegetation in the Sahara” provides an illustrative example of the outdated
         doctrine against pastoralists. Wright
         <span><a>2</a></span> uses historical analogues, such as the Rapa Nui environmental degradation, that appear
         inappropriate. In the instance of the island of Rapa Nui, its inhabitants were primarily
         farmers and fishermen, not pastoralists. Even so recent research suggests that major
         environmental degradation on Rapa Nui occurred only after European contact, and that
         pre-contact changes in land use were a result of environmental constraint, not degradation
         <span><a>42</a>,
            <a>43</a></span>. Using this type of analogue, one establishes a false premise i.e., where “landscapes
         with no previous exposure to grazing by domesticated animals have been documented
         as crossing ecological thresholds shortly after new grazing pressures were introduced”
         <span><a>2</a></span>. Northern Africa, however, was becoming a domesticated landscape from the early Holocene
         onwards (Fig. 
         <a>2</a>). Pastoralism co-evolved with dryland environments in a context where extant grazing
         ungulates were in abundance. Moreover recent genetic analyses of modern African cattle
         indicate considerable introgression from African aurochs, suggesting they underwent
         a hybridization with local wild stock
         <span><a>44</a></span>. The introduction of pastoralist strategies, therefore, were based upon natural ecosystem
         interactions and the functional roles of native wildlife causing little additional
         burden; allowing positive management of the environment.
