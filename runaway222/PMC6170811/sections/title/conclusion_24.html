      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many living systems exhibit drastic state shifts in response to small changes in environmental
         parameters. We argue here that animal societies—like other kinds of living systems—can
         be subject to tipping points and that a better understanding of tipping point dynamics
         can help us to predict changes in sociality and behaviour. Behavioural ecologists
         interested in such dynamics are poised to contribute novel insights, both theoretically
         and empirically. The insights gleaned from such studies have the potential to generate
         crosstalk between fields of ecology that typically operate independently. The tipping
         point framework in turn offers us (behavioural ecologists) a variety of opportunities.
         First, the tipping point framework asks us to re-examine familiar topics—information
         spread, collective action, group formation/disbandment, etc.—from a new perspective,
         which opens up new flavours of inquiry. Second, tipping points draw our attention
         to possible connections between the dynamics of social systems and other kinds of
         complex living systems—highlighting the opportunity for generalizing principles across
         tiers of biological organization. Third, the tipping points framework draws our attention
         to ideas from other subdisciplines of ecology and allows us to critically evaluate
         these ideas in a new context. Finally, understanding tipping points is of conservation
         importance for multiple tiers of biological organization, which permits basic researchers
         to probe tipping points while simultaneously collecting data that could prove useful
         for applied scientists. This incipient field is therefore ripe for creation and entry,
         and there is much for us to discover together.
