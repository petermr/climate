 <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why study tipping points in social behaviour?</div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many disciplines already use the ideas and terminology of tipping points to explore the properties of complex systems. This leads one to ask: what strengths can behavioural ecologists bring to the broader study of tipping points?</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, animal social systems provide us with the opportunity to observe interactions between individual-level and group-level tipping points. Although this review pertains to social tipping points in the dynamics of whole societies, individual organisms are themselves complex living systems with metabolic processes that can undergo tipping points in response to environmental parameters [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C62" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C62">62</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C63">63</a>]. One can therefore probe the scale at which tipping points occur by evaluating behavioural dynamics in response to environmental drivers when individuals are in isolation versus group settings or across groups of various size. Linking tiers of multilevel tipping points is a problem already faced by the tipping point literature on communities and ecosystems [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C6" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C6">6</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C63" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C63">63</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C64" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C64">64</a>], but one fears that the problem of scale (individual versus population versus community versus ecosystem) might be intractably great in such systems. Social tipping points in animal societies might therefore serve as a convenient intermediate ground in which to develop and critically evaluate theory on multilevel tipping points. Such individual versus group-level comparisons do not have clear analogues in the application of tipping points in the physical sciences. This opens the door to new lines of empirical inquiry and theory.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, behavioural ecologists have the ability to create large numbers of experimental systems [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C65" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C65">65</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C66" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C66">66</a>] and manipulate environmental parameters thought to cause tipping points [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C13" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C13">13</a>], thus allowing cause-effect inferences that elude purely theoretical studies or correlative studies on other living systems. General ecologists have used the tipping point framework to explore contrasting ecosystem dynamics [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C2" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C2">2</a>], shifts in community composition and functioning [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C4" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C4">4</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C8" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C8">8</a>], and decreases in the viability of imperilled wildlife populations [
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C31" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C31">31</a>,
  <a rid="RSPB20181282C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C32">32</a>]. Engineering such systems or altering them experimentally with a high degree of replication is often impossible or unethical. For many social systems, this is not so.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Third, using the tipping point framework has the potential to foster crosstalk between the kinds of questions asked by behavioural ecologists and investigators interested in other kinds of complex systems. The notion that similar principles might underlie the presence, severity, timing, and recoverability of tipping points across contrasting physical and living systems is intriguing, and behavioural ecologists are poised to enter this dialogue with precision.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, animal societies raise our consciousness to the presence of asymmetrical interaction rules, and therefore promise to inspire new kinds of tipping point models, which often assume that interaction rules are simple, symmetrical, and invariant. In animals, we know that individuals differ from each other in their attributes, the ways in which they interact, and the social influence they exert over their groups. While behavioural ecologists have potentially much to gain from the tipping point literature, the intellectual exchange promises to be bidirectional.</p>
