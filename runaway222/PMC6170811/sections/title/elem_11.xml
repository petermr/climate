  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can inform our understanding of animal societies in a variety of ways. First, documenting tipping points aids our ability to forecast dramatic state shifts in animal behaviour [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C29" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C29">29</a>]. This, in turn, can help us to predict how societies will change in response to environmental parameters, which is required for conservation [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C30" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C30">30</a>–
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C32" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C32">32</a>]. Second, tipping points convey information about societies' comparative sensitivity to environmental parameters. The presence of abrupt tipping points, pronounced hysteresis, an inability to recover to baseline dynamics following perturbation, and large differences in behavioural states all convey that the internal dynamics driving a system are strongly nonlinear. Additionally, in the presence of tipping points, a system's responsiveness to the environment could appear deceptively small, save for the regions immediately around the tipping point. Many systems therefore may appear deceptively stable, unless one specifically interrogates the limited set of conditions that trigger the system to tip. Third, scrutinizing tipping points and their adaptive function may shed light on how social groups are capable of incredible behavioural flexibility. For example, there is evidence that societies may self-organize or evolve to keep themselves near tipping points, so that they can respond dynamically to new information or environmental challenges [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C27" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C27">27</a>,
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C33">33</a>] and potentially maximize the adaptive advantages of both order and disorder [
   <a rid="RSPB20181282C33" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C33">33</a>]. Fourth, scrutinizing tipping points across tiers of biological organization may help us to determine whether there are generalizable features about their dynamics that bridge tiers of biological organization. Fifth, knowledge of tipping points can help guide researchers as to when a new modelling paradigm may be necessary to predict system behaviour.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How can social properties affect tipping points in social systems?</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many social properties could influence whether tipping points occur in a society. These include relatedness and group size, presence of keystone individuals, within-group behavioural diversity, group social organization, and groups' prior experience. In this section, we present a hypothetical example and then use it as a lens to pose how social properties might impact tipping points.</p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider a hypothetical situation where the activity level of a group of marmosets depends on the level of predation risk (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181282F3" href="#RSPB20181282F3">figure 3</a>). When predation risk is low, groups are socially active and have a chance of entering distracted social states. Distracted states may emerge when one individual steals fruit or chases another individual, resulting in a competitive tit-for-tat game. Once initiated, social activity can keep a group in an active and distracted state despite mild to moderate increases in predation risk. However, at a tipping point, even a distracted group will detect heightened risk, and activity will decrease in favour of vigilance. Returning back to social activity will then require a large decrease in predation risk because vigilance renders a group sensitive to even moderate risk. Thus, under some conditions, whether a group will be active or inactive will depend on its prior state (distracted versus vigilant), creating a hysteresis window.

      <span class="italic">y</span>-axis) in association with contrasting levels of predation risk (
      <span class="italic">x</span>-axis). At low levels of predation groups engage in social interactions that heighten group activity (1) but also distract groups from detecting small to moderate levels of predation risk (2). However, at some increased level of predation risk groups decrease activity and become vigilant (3), and extreme levels of risk will cause groups to go into hiding and cease activity (4). As risk dissipates, groups require a much lower level of risk to resume social activity (5).

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Group relatedness and size likely influence tipping points. Relatedness has an impact on a variety of social outcomes, including increased prosocial behaviour and decreased exploitation among group members [

    <a rid="RSPB20181282C35" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C35">35</a>]. Thus, social feedback driven by competitive interactions may be less stable between relatives [
    <a rid="RSPB20181282C36" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C36">36</a>]. Kin groups may also be more likely to share information about predation risk even at risk to themselves, for instance, via alarm calls [

    <a rid="RSPB20181282C38" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C38">38</a>]. Group size is also likely to impact the above scenario. Increasing group size could augment competitive interactions and keep individuals in a distracted state for longer. Larger groups may also compete more [
    <a rid="RSPB20181282C39" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C39">39</a>] and this could increase group distraction. Yet, larger groups also have more individuals with which to detect changes in the environment and share information [

In contrast, homogeneous groups run the risk of all individuals possessing the same sensitivities, making abrupt collective state shifts more likely. However, even for diverse groups, there will be some environmental parameters that cause tipping points in spite of any benefits.

The predicted outcome is similar to that of priming but differs in that stressors can appear interchangeable. A final stressor query is whether the social context of prior experience matters. For instance, the effects of prior experience may depend on whether individuals acquired their experience in isolation, in a group setting, or in a group setting that differs from their present group. The effects of such experiences will likely not be equivalent.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A system may pass through a tipping point if environmental parameters drive individuals into alternative metabolic states that affect individuals' behaviour. For example, excessive heat can force social ectotherms into collective activity either to cool themselves, like collective fanning behaviour in honeybees [
    <a rid="RSPB20181282C54" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C54">54</a>], or to evacuate a nest site entirely. Another potential example of a metabolic tipping point is when excessive cold or aridity causes collective huddling to preserve heat and water in small bodied animals [

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tipping points can also be mediated by social or cognitive parameters, which arise because individuals' perception of their environment has changed. For instance, cautious or flight-prone behaviour in one group member might catalyse that behaviour in another individual [
    <a rid="RSPB20181282C58" ref-type="bibr" href="#RSPB20181282C58">58</a>]. Alternatively, observer individuals may copy the successful foraging strategies of innovative group mates [

The key ingredient for these transitions is that actors are capable of observing their environment, and then adjusting their behaviour accordingly. In principle, social or cognitive state transitions can occur at different social scales as well. For example, each individual may independently learn about its environment, and therefore, the group's behaviour changes as the sum of these individual assessments. However, social interactions will often result in a synergistic shift [
