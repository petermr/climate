      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The information from each of the previous steps was analysed post-workshop. Features
         considered critical to determining system behaviour, such as goals, rules, information
         flows, and feedback structures, were identified. Analysis of these features provided
         significant insight into the factors that have the most influence on tree canopy levels
         in areas of urban infill in Perth. These factors included:

               <p>Planning policies and practices are driven predominantly by the goal of a more compact
                  city, resulting in significant reductions in tree canopy.

            </div>
            <div>
               <p>A lack of policies and regulations to support the inclusion and retention of trees
                  in a more compact city.

               <p>Accounting processes with regard to urban infrastructure do not adequately capture
                  the value of services provided by trees or the cost of their removal.

            <div>
               <p>A lack of awareness about the range of benefits provided by tree canopy and the long-term

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Urban consolidation policies were seen as a strong influence on system behaviour.
         The vision of Directions 2031 is for “a world-class liveable city: green, vibrant,
         more compact, and accessible with a unique sense of place”. The “more compact” element
         of this vision is supported by a clear target of an extra 154,000 infill dwellings
         and the Urban Growth Monitor, which reports on the construction of dwellings in urban
         areas [
         <a>56</a>]. 
         <a>Figure 7</a> is a stock-and-flow map that depicts how these support mechanisms drive progress
         towards the infill target. The key stock (represented by the rectangle) is urban density,
         which is measured by the Urban Growth Monitor. The rate of infill development (represented
         by the tap symbol) is driven by the size of the gap between the current level of urban
         density and the urban-density target. As urban density approaches the target level,
         the gap between the two will reduce, the rate of infill development will slow down,
         and ideally, the urban density target will be met. These mechanisms are supported
         by a range of policies and market interest in meeting the demand for new dwellings.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The influence that the ‘Compact Mechanism’ has on tree canopy stock is represented
         by the dotted links in 
         <a>Figure 8</a>. Findings from the policy review and the workshop activities support the conclusion
         that current urban infill practices typically reduce opportunities to plant trees
         and increase the rate of removal of trees, both leading to a decline in tree canopy.
         Directions 2031 provides support for a more compact city, but contains no specific
         tree canopy targets, and no provision for monitoring tree canopy levels, planting,
         or the removal of trees. We conclude that, in the context of Directions 2031, a reduction
         of tree canopy levels in areas of urban infill are likely to be a side effect of mechanisms
         to support a more compact city.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relationship between urban density and tree canopy levels depicted above can be
         analysed using system archetypes. In 
         <a>Figure 9</a>, the relationship between the Compact City and the World-Class Liveable City is expressed
         in terms of an archetype called “Shifting the Burden” [
         <a>32</a>]. This archetype depicts a situation where the gap between the desired state and
         the current state of the system can be managed by two alternative solutions: a symptomatic
         solution or a fundamental solution. Symptomatic solutions are frequently applied because
         they respond to a problem symptom and are often 
         <span>part of</span> the fundamental solution; however, they can also undermine progress towards the desired
         outcome in other ways. If management of the system is focused primarily on the Compact
         Vision, other important aspects of liveability such as tree canopy can be neglected,
         which is expressed in 
         <a>Figure 9</a> as ‘Tunnel Vision’. In the long run, the adverse effects may be recognised, and result
         in a shift to the fundamental solution. However, in this situation, the shift is limited
         by factors that are difficult to reverse, such as the removal of mature canopy trees
         and urban design that fails to incorporate trees. 
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The failure of the current system to account for the value of trees and the external
         costs associated with reductions in tree canopy was identified as a significant barrier
         to the effective management of tree canopy in urban infill areas. Although the ecosystem
         services provided by trees are critical to a healthy urban environment, the value
         of these services is largely absent from traditional economic approaches that drive
         budgets and private developers. While it was recognised that there was a willingness
         to pay a premium for greener areas that could support market mechanisms to increase
         tree canopy, it was considered likely to be limited to higher socio-economic areas.
         This is supported by studies in other cities that have shown that low income areas
         recorded lower rates of vegetation [
         <a>57</a>,
         <a>58</a>] as well as higher temperatures [
         <a>58</a>].
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The extent of community awareness influences tree canopy via pressure on policy makers
         and the market place to incorporate trees into urban environments. The strength of
         this feedback is a critical determinant of the system’s behaviour; however, evidence
         from this study indicates that at the time of this study, this feedback loop is relatively
         weak. As stated in the Capital City Planning Framework [
         <a>55</a>], the incremental nature of tree canopy loss often means that it “goes unnoticed
         until it is too late to undertake preventative actions”. In effect, as levels gradually
         decline, lower tree canopy levels may become the new norm.
