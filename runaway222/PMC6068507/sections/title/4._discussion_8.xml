 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The discussion is focused on the final activity of CCM, ‘Can we have new eyes?’ The shift to a more compact city is not unique to Perth. Increasing awareness of the high economic, environmental, and social costs of urban sprawl is creating a global move towards more compact cities [
  <a rid="B59-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B59-ijerph-15-01547">59</a>]. The considerable benefits of compact cities include the more efficient delivery of essential infrastructure, goods, and services, and reduced environmental costs of land-clearing and long commute times. Compact cities also promote health, with ‘walkable’ distances encouraging active transport and physical activity in general [
  <a rid="B60-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B60-ijerph-15-01547">60</a>]. Perth is one of the most sprawling cities in the world, and progress towards a more compact city, especially in light of the anticipated population growth, is clearly warranted. However, care must be taken so that the higher densities are planned and designed in a way that avoids undesirable consequences such as those associated with lower tree canopy levels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interest in this research stemmed from the relationship between urban form, tree canopy, and temperature, within the context of a warming climate in Perth, which is a city that regularly experiences temperatures in excess of 40 °C during summer. This research supports the findings of others that the management of climate impacts within urban areas is generally given only minor consideration within planning frameworks and development policy [
  <a rid="B5-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-ijerph-15-01547">5</a>,
  <a rid="B61-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B61-ijerph-15-01547">61</a>]. In a review of climate action plans from cities in the US, Stone, Vargo, and Habeeb [
  <a rid="B10-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10-ijerph-15-01547">10</a>] concluded that excluding UHI mitigation strategies from plans may “fail to adequately protect human health and welfare from rapidly rising temperatures”. The evidence from this study suggests that the UHI effect is not given significant consideration in planning frameworks, and the risk to human health in Perth is likely to increase without action. The inclusion of heatwaves in the Natural Hazards and Disaster Policy would be an appropriate starting point for considering the influence and role of the planning sector with regard to the urban climate. 
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequent to this research, the Perth and Peel@3.5million report was released in March 2018 [
  <a rid="B62-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B62-ijerph-15-01547">62</a>]. The report extends strategic land-use planning beyond Direction 2031 to the year 2050. Some elements of the report that are relevant to this research are encouraging. The report states that “enhancing the urban forest and increasing tree canopy cover is the most efficient and economical way to reduce the effects of urban heat island in communities” (p72). The importance of this issue was also raised by the Environmental Protection Authority response to the draft report, which recommended actions to counteract the effects of the UHI effect through a greening strategy for the region [
  <a rid="B63-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B63-ijerph-15-01547">63</a>]. Information flows have also improved with widespread mapping of the urban forest; however, these have raised further concerns. The Urban Forest of Perth and Peel Statistical Report stated that tree canopy levels in Perth are highly variable with some areas recording less than 5% coverage [
  <a rid="B64-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B64-ijerph-15-01547">64</a>]. Other studies have reported similar levels of variability, with the lowest levels often recorded in areas of lower socio-economic status. The Urban Forest report also highlights that trees on residential land account for a significant proportion of the urban forest in many areas, and that these trees (and areas) are at greatest risk due to policies that support increases in density while offering limited protection for established trees. While the Perth Peel report updated urban infill targets to 377,130 new infill dwellings by 2050 and recognised the potential impact on the tree canopy levels of these dwellings, the report does not include a tree canopy target or a clear strategy on how the risk to tree canopy and flow-on effects will be addressed. Improvements in the availability of tree canopy and urban infill could be used to develop and test quantitative system dynamic models in future research.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another recent report on Urban Forests from the Western Australian Local Government Association (WALGA) provides additional insights into the findings of this study [
  <a rid="B65-ijerph-15-01547" ref-type="bibr" href="#B65-ijerph-15-01547">65</a>]. A survey involving 33 Local Government Areas (LGAs) highlighted that many are actively addressing the challenge of falling tree canopy levels in urban areas with initiatives such as street tree policies and urban forest plans (78% and 60% of LGAs respectively). However, the key finding was that without changes to “state government planning legislation, policies, and plans … local government will struggle to maintain and grow their urban forests, particularly on private land and verges” (p6). In addition, plans for a framework to support local government management of the issue were considered to be “of no value unless there is clear head of power/legislation to give local governments the ability to enforce it” (p4).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These recent findings support the findings of the case study, which indicate that the behaviour of the current system is dominated by actions to increase urban density whilst failing to provide protection for urban canopy levels. The series of leverage points identified during the study provide a range of management options that can lead to a more sustainable approach where a balance between urban density and tree canopy is achieved.</p>
