  <span class="italic">N</span> = 70) and student registered-nurse anesthetists (
  <span class="italic">N</span> = 40). The characteristics of each training program are included in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> for the transferability purposes of the qualitative data interpretation.
