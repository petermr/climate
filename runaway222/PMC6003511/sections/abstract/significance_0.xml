 <p>The North Pacific hosts extensive oxygen minimum zones. Ventilation of North Pacific Intermediate Water mitigates hypoxia in thermocline waters not under influence of ocean–atmosphere processes. Instrumental datasets show recent decadal decreases in O
  <sub>2</sub>, but millennial-scale natural variations in mesopelagic ventilation might be large and are not understood well. We reconstruct Holocene ventilation changes in a key region (Okhotsk Sea). Modern ventilation and O
  <sub>2</sub> levels are a relatively recent feature. In the warmer-than-present Early Holocene, middepth O
  <sub>2</sub> concentrations were 25 to 50% reduced, with significant millennial-scale variations. A sudden ventilation decrease six thousand years ago is linked to higher ocean temperatures, sea ice loss, and higher remineralization, corroborated by results from paleoclimate modeling, providing constraints for future warming scenarios.
