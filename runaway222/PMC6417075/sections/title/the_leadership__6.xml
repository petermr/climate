 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LOCI is a 12-month empirically and theoretically based, multi-faceted, and multilevel implementation strategy that aims to improve first-level (e.g., clinic) general leadership and implementation leadership combined with the development, adaptation, and use of organizational strategies to create a positive strategic organizational climate to support EBP implementation and sustainment [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>]. This study is being conducted in cooperation with the developers of LOCI through a process of adaptation for the Norwegian settings of mental health clinics with multiple health trusts. All LOCI materials were translated into Norwegian and reviewed with the US LOCI team (GAA, MGE, MS) through an iterative process of review and adaptation in regard to both materials and processes.
 </p>
 <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LOCI targets multiple levels of leadership within an organization to facilitate an aligned agenda toward EBP implementation. It is designed to strengthen leadership among first-level leaders (hereafter called LOCI leaders), who have the role of supervision of individuals providing direct services [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>]. Although these leaders are in a position to facilitate EBP implementation, they may often be promoted based on clinical expertise with little support or training in effective leadership of workplace change efforts such as EBP implementation. In addition, LOCI includes leaders at higher administrative levels in order to create alignment and support for implementation across all levels of the organizational structure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">LOCI utilizes both the Full-Range Leadership Model (FRL) and implementation leadership as complementary leadership skills and behaviors that can be utilized to develop a positive EBP implementation climate and to effectively lead the implementation process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. The FRL is the most comprehensively researched and validated approach to leadership for individual and organizational development [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>]. It includes both transformational and transactional leadership. Transformational leadership is related to a leader’s ability to inspire, create a compelling vision, and motivate their employees through being a positive role model and creating a collective identity with a joint vision. Transactional leadership is related to a leader’s ability to manage and motivate their employees through appropriate rewards [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>]. Appropriate use of the two dimensions is linked to effective leadership. Across several meta-analyses summarizing over a hundred studies, transformational leadership has been shown to consistently predict effectiveness outcomes across the individual and team levels of analysis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>]. While the FRL addresses those leadership behaviors related to general leadership effectiveness, implementation leadership focuses specifically on how leaders can enhance implementation efforts in their organizations. The implementation leadership approach involves behaviors that fall on four dimensions: being knowledgeable about the EBP being implemented and its role in the organization, being proactive and anticipatory in problem-solving, supporting others in the implementation process, and persevering through the ups and downs of the implementation process [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Congruent with the emerging emphasis on mechanisms in implementation and clinical science, implementation leadership is considered to be a primary antecedent (i.e., determinant) of implementation climate (i.e., target), defined as “employees’ shared perception of the importance of innovation implementation within the organization” [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>]. LOCI also builds on the work of Schein [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>] utilizing climate embedding mechanisms toward enhanced implementation climate. Leaders can change and transmit the organizational culture and climate through primary embedding mechanisms, such as what the leaders and organization emphasize, value, reward, and focus on. For example, what leaders pay attention to measure and control; how they react to critical incidents; how resources are allocated for role modeling, teaching and coaching, recognition, rewards, and status; and how leaders recruit, select, and promote employees. Secondary embedding mechanisms reinforce primary mechanisms and may include organizational systems, processes, and procedures, formal statements (e.g., mission and vision) stories, and organizational rituals. LOCI also aims to improve psychological safety climate that promotes a more engaged and effective workforce [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>]. It is furthermore anticipated that leadership and climate impact implementation effectiveness through employees’ actual behavior. Such behaviors include implementation citizenship behavior, defined as going above and beyond what is required in order to support the implementation of EBP [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>]. The actual behavior of employees that can support the implementation of EBP can take the form of helping others, keeping informed, showing commitment to the EBP in focus, and supporting its use. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a> illustrates how LOCI is hypothesized to work; the intervention will have a proximal effect on improved leadership, which will strengthen the work group climate, which will then be related to therapist conception and behavior such as clinician’s implementation citizenship behavior and sense of job demands, and ultimately to implementation outcomes, including treatment fidelity, implementation process, and patient outcomes.

 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Preliminary results from evaluation of LOCI have shown that the implementation strategy is feasible and acceptable; improves leader knowledge, engagement, and implementation behaviors; and has utility to improve staff-rated leadership for EBP implementation [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>]. In addition, LOCI leads to improvements in staff-rated implementation climate [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>]. However, similar to research on other implementation strategies, research on LOCI is still limited. It has been tested in one study [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" href="#CR5">5</a>], in addition to one ongoing randomized controlled trial [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>], both in the United States. LOCI has not yet been adapted and tested in other countries. Consequently, there is a knowledge gap in the documented effect and generalizability of strategies for implementation leadership. Replication is needed, and in particular, where LOCI is conducted not by the developers, but by other researchers or service providers.

 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The implementation of evidence-based practices for PTSD in Norway is initiated and funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services and implemented by the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS). The overall aims of this national initiative are that therapists’ knowledge of trauma and trauma treatment will be enhanced, patients with post-traumatic stress symptoms will receive the best evidence-supported treatments, and the knowledge and quality with which treatment methods are provided to patients will be maintained over time.</p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after experiencing life-threatening or extreme stressful events such as accidents, assaults, or violence. The symptoms may lead to decreased functioning, social isolation, increased risk of suicide, and the development of comorbid diseases such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>]. A recent study on the epidemiology of PTSD in Norway showed that the lifetime prevalence was 4.3% for women and 1.4% for men, and the mean duration of PTSD was 9 years for women and 17 years for men [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>]. As a comparison, the prevalence is estimated to be higher than both lung cancer and colorectal cancer, illustrating the high prevalence of PTSD in the Norwegian population. In 2017, 6% of children in Norwegian psychiatric outpatient services received a PTSD diagnosis [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>].
 </p>
 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the project, all therapists in the participating clinics will be trained in screening and diagnosing of PTSD. In addition, three of the most well-documented EBPs for PTSD will be implemented [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>]. In adult clinics, eye movement and desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) and cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) will be implemented. EMDR is an integrative eight-phase individual approach which is guided by the adaptive information processing model [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>]. EMDR has shown to be effective for patients with PTSD in several studies [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>–
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>]. CT-PTSD is individualized treatment using trauma memories and reactions to related triggers by imaginary and in-vivo exposure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>]. CT-PTSD has shown to be effective for patients with PTSD [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>, 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>]. In child and youth clinics, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>] will be implemented. These clinics serve children aged 6–18 years and their non-offending caregiver(s) on a weekly basis over 12–15 weeks. TF-CBT is phase based, builds on cognitive behavioral principles, and incorporates principles from family therapy. Research from more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) has demonstrated that TF-CBT is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms as well as depressive symptoms (e.g., [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>]).
