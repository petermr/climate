      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using Arksey/O’Malley’s and Levac’s methodological framework, MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase,
         Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health, Health
         Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO will be systematically
         searched. Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied by two independent
         reviewers to determine study eligibility. Studies published in English and after 2005
         only will be examined. Following selection of studies, data will be extracted and
         analysed.
