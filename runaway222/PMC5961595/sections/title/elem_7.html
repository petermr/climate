         <a>18 19</a> The framework consists of the following six stages: (1) identifying the research
         question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selection of studies, (4) charting
         the data, (5) collating, summarising and reporting results and (6) consultation with
         relevant stakeholders, thereby enabling knowledge translation. A flowchart of the
         six stages may be found in online

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following preliminary research on climate change and health, it became apparent that
            evidence on the education approach concerning the relationship of climate change and
            health was insufficient for understanding best practice in course development, thus
            illustrating an evidence gap. Considering this deficiency, the review’s research question
            in 
            <a>table 1</a> was developed.

               Embase, Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health,
               Health Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO. Following the
               development of MeSH terms, subject headings and keywords used to index articles, the
               search strategy will be reviewed by an Imperial College medical librarian. Search
               terms will include MeSH and keywords related to (1) teaching, (2) learning, (3) education,
               (4) climate change and (5) health. Publication status, publication date and language
               will be subjected to limits. Hence, searches will be restricted to papers published
               in English between 2005 and 2017. As minimal attention was attributed to the public
               health implications of climate change before 2005,
               <a>16</a> papers published after 2005 only will be considered. Following the MEDLINE/PubMed
               search, the search strategy will be converted and applied to the remaining databases.
               Details pertaining to the review’s searching strategy for MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and
               Scopus may be found in online 
               <a>supplementary appendices 3–5</a>. Additional search strategies may be requested at a later stage (once completed)
               from the review’s first author. Results of the database searches will be subsequently
               imported to EndNote, a bibliographic software. Bibliographic citations of included
               studies will be searched to identify any additional relevant studies.

            <a>Table 2</a> outlines the study’s inclusion criteria. Based on the review’s predetermined inclusion

            screened by two reviewers, to ensure no bias occurs.
            <a>19</a> Ineligible papers will be eliminated. Titles and abstracts that appear to meet the
            review’s eligibility criteria will be subjected to full-text reading. A third reviewer
            will assist in the selection process if the two primary reviewers cannot reach a consensus
            on study eligibility. A PRISMA flow diagram will be used to demonstrate the review’s
            selection process and exclusion reasons, demonstrating replicability and transparency.
            This stage will represent an iterative process, incorporating search of the literature,
            refinement of search strategies and selection of articles.

            use of control), learner characteristics (profession, number of participants, age),

            adequately, the forms used for data extraction will be reviewed by the research team

            <a>20</a> Following data extraction, results will be presented: (1) numerically—synopsis of
            the amount and type of included studies and (ii) narratively—a synthesis of all included
            studies. The authors will discuss implications of the findings on future research,
            practice and policy.
            <a>19</a> To provide a holistic analysis, the structure of the intervention of interest (all
            teaching forms used to teach learners the relationship between climate change and
            health) will be captured by recording pedagogy, course content and learning outcomes.
            This will consist of data including, but not limited to educational method, educational
            content, length/duration, outcome measures, outcome results and financial support.
            We believe that this approach will allow us to determine the educational experience
            of learners and educators as the needs of learners, learner–educator interactions,
            learner–learner interactions, contributions of the department and use of information
            to nudge behaviours and improve decision-making skills will be considered. Details
            of Stage V remain in progress and will be finalised in November 2017. However, they
