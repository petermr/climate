         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The observed and projected impacts of climate change on human health are significant.
            While climate change has gathered global momentum and is taught frequently, the extent
            to which the relationships between climate change and health are taught remains uncertain.
            Education provides an opportunity to create public engagement on these issues, but
            the extent to which historical implementation of climate health education could be
            leveraged is not well understood. To address this gap, we propose to conduct a scoping
            review of all forms of teaching that have been used to illustrate the health effects
            of climate change between 2005 and 2017, coinciding with a turning point in the public
            health and climate change agendas following the 2005 Group of 7/8 (G7/8) Summit.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using Arksey/O’Malley’s and Levac’s methodological framework, MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase,
            Scopus, Education Resource Information Centre, Web of Science, Global Health, Health
            Management Information Consortium, Georef, Ebsco and PROSPERO will be systematically
            searched. Predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied by two independent
            reviewers to determine study eligibility. Studies published in English and after 2005
            only will be examined. Following selection of studies, data will be extracted and
            analysed.
