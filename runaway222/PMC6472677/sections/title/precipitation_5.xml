 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We use three different 3‐hourly precipitation data sets that are commonly based on multiple satellite measurements: version 1.0 of the CMORPH (Climate Prediction Center morphing method, Joyce et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0022">2004</a>) precipitation product, PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks, K.‐L. Hsu et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0019">1997</a>), and version 7 of TRMM3B42 (from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, hereafter referred as TRMM, Huffman et al., 
  <a rid="grl58562-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" href="#grl58562-bib-0021">2007</a>). CMORPH precipitation is derived by propagating infrared data from geostationary satellites to precipitation estimates obtained from passive microwave sensor aboard polar‐orbiting satellites, which complement each other with their different advantages on detection accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage. The PERSIANN algorithm also uses combined infrared and passive microwave information from multiple geostationary and low Earth orbit satellites with an artificial neural network model of which parameters are updated with ground‐based data. TRMM precipitation is a combined precipitation estimates from multiple satellite systems, which is adjusted with rain gauge observations. We adjusted the 3‐hourly precipitation data sets to local time based on longitude before the analysis.
