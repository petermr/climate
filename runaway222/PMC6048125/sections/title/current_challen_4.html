      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While technological advances in observing systems allow unprecedented monitoring,
         there are fundamental questions that remain. How is surface meltwater partitioned
         between infiltration and runoff
         <span><a>19</a></span>? How rapidly will this partitioning change as a function of snow/firn extent, porosity
         and permeability
         <span><a>20</a></span>? Where does this water access the bed
         <span><a>21</a></span>? How pervasive and persistent might efficient subglacial drainage become
         <span><a>11</a></span>, and what role do the bed areas isolated from the drainage system play in ice-sheet
         dynamics
         <span><a>12</a></span>? How important is ice-sheet hydrology in driving mass loss from marine-terminating
         outlets, both at the ice front and upstream
         <span><a>22</a></span>?

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Satellite remote sensing is now able to provide regular ice-sheet-wide snapshots of
         ice-surface velocities and net mass changes (e.g. NASA MEaSUREs program), while ground-based
         and airborne geophysical data (e.g. through Operation IceBridge) also play an important
         role in spatially extended studies. But many hydrological variables remain challenging
         to observe, let alone predict. Supraglacial channels of several metres width are visible
         from space, but depths and water fluxes are difficult to obtain. Discrete injection
         of meltwater through moulins is a key feature of the drainage system, but predicting
         moulin formation can be challenging. The englacial and subglacial drainage systems
         are almost entirely obscured from view, directly observable only at the point-scale
         through labour-intensive borehole drilling or natural portals such as moulins. Models
         of ice-sheet hydrology, still in their infancy, tend to resolve individual conduit
         elements, making efficient coupling with large-scale ice-flow models still a thing
         of the future. They also require parameterization of metre-scale bed roughness and
         higher resolution bed topography than is widely available.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continued progress will require sustained efforts to better image the ice-sheet interior
         and bed as well as coastal bathymetry, combined with data assimilation exercises such
         as BedMachine designed to produce seamless and self-consistent public datasets
         <span><a>23</a></span>. Information on bed composition
         <span><a>24</a></span> and roughness at multiple scales would help reduce unnecessary ambiguity for models.
         From surface to bed to ice front, we also need to exercise creativity in upscaling
         process-based studies, and vigilance in the unavoidable geographical biases imposed
         by field logistics. Productive partnerships between disciplinary specialists will
         move the science forward fastest, as demonstrated in grassroots initiatives like GRISO
         (
         <span>https://web.whoi.edu/griso/</span>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a community, we have developed a nuanced understanding of the impact of surface
         meltwater on the dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet, but ice sheets are more than
         just their net contributions to global sea level. They sculpt landscapes, deliver
         sediment, solutes and nutrients to the ocean, gravitationally shape our coastlines
         and influence global climate. Although the threat of surface meltwater to Greenland’s
         stability does not appear as grave as it once did, the details of how and where meltwater
         is stored, how it is ultimately transported through the ice sheet to the ocean, and
         what physical, chemical and biological effects it has along the way should be priorities
         for future research. There we have barely scratched the surface.
