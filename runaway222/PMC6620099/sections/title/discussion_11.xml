 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate that SOM decomposition in the topsoil was more sensitive to warming than in the subsoil. This significant difference could be due to the following two reasons. First, the stronger SOM protection by aggregates in the subsoil could attenuate 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>. Aggregate protection exerts important control over the stabilization of SOM (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>), and it has been reported that small sizes of aggregates need more energy to be disrupted (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). That is to say, the degree of protection increases with the decline in aggregate sizes and would be stronger in microaggregates (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). In our study, a higher proportion of C stored in microaggregates in the subsoil compared with the topsoil indicated that aggregate protection was stronger in the subsoil, which further resulted in a lower 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> value through the following two aspects. On the one hand, SOM is occluded in the interior of microaggregates, inducing spatial disconnection between substrates and enzymes, and thus protecting SOM from microbial decomposition (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>). On the other hand, the small sizes of microaggregates could restrict the diffusion of oxygen (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>), which limits the activity of microorganisms and results in low 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). Overall, the determining role of SOM protection by aggregates observed here, together with previous proposals (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>), jointly demonstrates the importance of aggregate protection in governing the response of SOM decomposition to global warming.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, variations in microbial communities between soil depths could lead to the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> difference. Microorganisms are addressed to play key roles in regulating the terrestrial C cycle, mediating not only the rate of SOM decomposition but also its responses to warming (
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">
   <span class="italic">14</span>
  </a>). In our study, the lower microbial abundance in the subsoil (table S2) that resulted from the alterations in soil resource availability (e.g., the decline in soil C and nitrogen; table S3) might constrain SOM decomposition even under high temperature and thus attenuate 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). Moreover, microbial community composition would also affect 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>. It has been reported that fungi are the dominant decomposers of recalcitrant substrates (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). Because the decomposition of these low-quality substrates requires greater activation energy (
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">
   <span class="italic">8</span>
  </a>), the shift in microbial community composition with decreasing proportion of fungi with soil depth may contribute to the lower 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the subsoil (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). These deductions were further confirmed by the microorganism reciprocal transplant experiment: By applying inoculums with high microbial abundance and fungi proportion to the subsoil, 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> significantly increased, while applying inoculums with low microbial abundance and fungi proportion to the topsoil significantly decreased 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> (fig. S2A). In addition to the variations in microbial communities, the activities of subsoil microorganisms might not be sustained by enough energy due to the lack of fresh substrates (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>), which would further attenuate 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the subsoil (
  <a rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" href="#R33">
   <span class="italic">33</span>
  </a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results also demonstrated that the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> variation in the active pool was primarily mediated by microbial communities, whereas the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> variation in the slow pool was mainly explained by aggregate protection. The difference in the underlying mechanisms between C pools could be largely due to their distinct physicochemical and biological properties. To be specific, most compounds in the active pool are unprotected and thus more accessible to microorganisms (
  <a rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" href="#R13">
   <span class="italic">13</span>
  </a>). The high substrate availability indicates that the decomposition of these unprotected SOM and their responses to warming are mainly related to microbial communities (
  <a rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" href="#R27">
   <span class="italic">27</span>
  </a>), especially for the subsoil, where low microbial abundance and fungal proportions could limit the decomposition activity under a warming scenario (
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">
   <span class="italic">15</span>
  </a>). By contrast, in the slow pool, most compounds are preserved with the protection of soil minerals and aggregates (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>). Even in the presence of high-quality substrates and a competent microbial community, aggregates could prevent the contact of substrates and microorganisms and constrain the responses of SOM decomposition to warming (
  <a rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" href="#R3">
   <span class="italic">3</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">
   <span class="italic">10</span>
  </a>). Consequently, the level of SOM protection by aggregates becomes the major determinant of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the slow pool. Nevertheless, other properties might also be distinct among soil C pools and thus function differently in regulating 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> of various SOM components, such as the dynamics of enzyme pools (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>) and the energetic signatures of substrates (
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), which need to be addressed in future studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although our study provided empirical evidence for the mechanisms underlying 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub>, there are still some limitations. First, in addition to the mechanisms considered in this study, other biotic and abiotic controls such as the energetic constraints of microorganisms (
  <a rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" href="#R2">
   <span class="italic">2</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R31" ref-type="bibr" href="#R31">
   <span class="italic">31</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" href="#R32">
   <span class="italic">32</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R35" ref-type="bibr" href="#R35">
   <span class="italic">35</span>
  </a>), the dynamics of enzyme pools and their catalytic power (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>), the spatial separation of substrates (
  <a rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" href="#R36">
   <span class="italic">36</span>
  </a>), and the diffusion of enzymes and oxygen (
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">
   <span class="italic">11</span>
  </a>) could also regulate SOM decomposition and its temperature response. Extending studies incorporating these factors are deserved to gain further understanding on this issue. Second, despite a widely used sterilization technique with limited effects on soil physical properties, γ-irradiation would affect soil chemical properties through the release of labile C (
  <a rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" href="#R37">
   <span class="italic">37</span>
  </a>). Moreover, noncellular processes, which have been considered important in CO
  <sub>2</sub> production (
  <a rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" href="#R38">
   <span class="italic">38</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" href="#R39">
   <span class="italic">39</span>
  </a>), were not determined in the current sterilization experiment. Future studies should thus aim to better differentiate the effects of substrates and microorganisms and also evaluate the contribution of noncellular processes to soil C release and their temperature responses. Third, the 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> values of different soil C pools were estimated from a first-order kinetic model without representing other controls on SOC dynamics, such as microbial growth, activities, turnover, and C use efficiency (
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">
   <span class="italic">40</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">
   <span class="italic">41</span>
  </a>); enzyme activities and dynamics (
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">
   <span class="italic">34</span>
  </a>, 
  <a rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" href="#R42">
   <span class="italic">42</span>
  </a>); organic matter–mineral interactions (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>); and hydrologically driven diffusion of substrates or enzymes (
  <a rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" href="#R43">
   <span class="italic">43</span>
  </a>). In view of the simple assumption about soil C turnover in current models, uncertainties might exist in model estimations. Hence, future studies should improve model structure to better reflect the mechanisms of soil C stabilization (
  <a rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" href="#R6">
   <span class="italic">6</span>
  </a>) and also measure 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> of different soil C pools directly to provide benchmark for model development.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, through a multiple approach–based analysis, we observed that, across soil depths, lower microbial abundance and stronger SOM protection by aggregates are two coexisting mechanisms responsible for the lower 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> in the subsoil. We also found that the underlying mechanisms of 
  <span class="italic">Q</span>
  <sub>10</sub> were different between the active and slow pools, as microbial communities dominated in the active pool, whereas aggregate protection was more important in the slow pool. Given that the slow C pool is the largest component of SOM with a longer turnover time, SOM protection via microaggregates could be the key mechanism that regulates the long-term response of SOM decomposition to global warming. Overall, these findings imply that the existence of soil C stabilization mechanisms could reduce the effect of climate warming on SOM decomposition, especially for the large deep and slow C pools, thereby attenuating the predicted terrestrial C-climate feedback.
