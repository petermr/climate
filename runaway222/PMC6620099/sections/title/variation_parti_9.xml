  <sub>10</sub>. The variation is partitioned to the following fractions: pure effect of aggregate protection (X
  <sub>1</sub>), pure effect of microbial communities (X
  <sub>2</sub>), joint effects of aggregate protection and microbial communities (X
  <sub>3</sub>), and unexplained variations. Aggregate protection includes the percentage of soil C stored in macroaggregates (250 to 2000 μm) and microaggregates (53 to 250 μm). Microbial communities refer to the relative abundance of fungal PLFAs.
