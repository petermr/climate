 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Generalized Least Squares (GLS) analysis was used to regress the spectral exponent (temporal autocorrelation) and spatial range (spatial autocorrelation) against time for each of the 21 GCM models as well as the multimodel mean. GLS was used in order to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of residuals in the spatial and temporal temperature data. To assess model agreement and robustness of trends, we calculated respectively the proportion of models that agreed on the direction of the trend and the proportion of models that both agreed on the direction of trend and were statistically significant (

  </span>. We conducted the spatial and temporal analyses on daily temperature in 10-year time windows between 1871 and 2099 for the global dataset. Each metric of autocorrelation, the spectral exponent or spatial range, was calculated for each time window, and GLS was used to regress the autocorrelation values for each time window against time. We also conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of all of our results to different time windows ranging in size from 5 to 10 years (see Tables
