      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breakpoint analysis was used to detect any tipping points or significant changes in
         the linear trends over time in both the temporal and spatial patterns of autocorrelation
         via piecewise regression
         <span><a>41</a>–
            <a>44</a></span>. This was done using the R package ‘strucchange’, which uses a non-parametric method
         to estimate the response function and its derivatives, and how that response function
         changes across the range of the explanatory variable (i.e., time in this case; 44).
         Function ‘breakpoints’ was used to determine breakpoints in spatial and temporal trends,
         which identifies the change point by fitting degree 1 splines (piecewise linear functions)
         with zero through five knot points (change or breakpoint linking the two piecewise
         functions) of unknown locations
         <span><a>44</a></span>. Results were robust to other non-parametric breakpoint analysis methods implemented
         in R packages ‘SiZer’ and ‘changepoint’
         <span><a>45</a>,
            <a>46</a></span>. Model selection using the small sample size corrected Akaike Information Criterion
         (AIC
         <sub>C</sub>) was used to find the optimal number of breakpoints (ref.
         <span><a>47</a></span>; see Table 
         <a>S4</a>).
