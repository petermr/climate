 <div class="title">Simulated and reconstructed climate of the IPWP during the LGM.</div>
 <p>Change in (
  <span class="bold">A</span>) rainfall and (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) SST (shading) and surface wind stress (vectors) simulated by CESM1 under LGM boundary conditions relative to preindustrial conditions. The color schemes for SST and rainfall change are not linear. Proxy-inferred changes in hydroclimate (symbols) indicate drier (brown), wetter (green), or unchanged (white) conditions at the LGM relative to the Late Holocene (top). Triangles represent merged sites within a radius of 100 km. Dark gray circles or triangles indicate disagreement between different proxies at a given site or merged sites. SST changes (bottom) are derived from geochemical proxies (see the Supplementary Materials) and are plotted as circles on the same color scale as the simulated changes. Proxy-model agreement for hydroclimate is measured by a Cohen’s κ value of 0.28. Proxy-model agreement for SST is measured by a pattern correlation of 0.34. Coastlines correspond to the LGM 120-m drop in sea level.
