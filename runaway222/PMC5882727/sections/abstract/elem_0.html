      <p>Complex systems exhibiting critical transitions when one of their governing parameters
         varies are ubiquitous in nature and in engineering applications. Despite a vast literature
         focusing on this topic, there are few studies dealing with the effect of the rate
         of change of the bifurcation parameter on the tipping points. In this work, we consider
         a subcritical stochastic Hopf bifurcation under two scenarios: the bifurcation parameter
         is first changed in a quasi-steady manner and then, with a finite ramping rate. In
         the latter case, a rate-dependent bifurcation delay is observed and exemplified experimentally
         using a thermoacoustic instability in a combustion chamber. This delay increases with
         the rate of change. This leads to a state transition of larger amplitude compared
         with the one that would be experienced by the system with a quasi-steady change of
         the parameter. We also bring experimental evidence of a dynamic hysteresis caused
         by the bifurcation delay when the parameter is ramped back. A surrogate model is derived
         in order to predict the statistic of these delays and to scrutinize the underlying
         stochastic dynamics. Our study highlights the dramatic influence of a finite rate
         of change of bifurcation parameters upon tipping points, and it pinpoints the crucial
         need of considering this effect when investigating critical transitions.
