         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our simulations reveal substantial inequality in the global-mean temperature response
            to identical total annual aerosol emissions in each region (Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>, 
            <span>y</span>-axis). The largest global mean temperature change (−0.29 ± 0.01 °C, induced in our
            simulations by emissions from Western Europe) is approximately 14 times larger than
            the smallest global mean temperature changes (−0.02 ± 0.01 °C induced by emissions
            from India). Global-mean temperature effects correlate roughly with latitude, with
            higher latitude emitting regions typically generating stronger temperature effects
            than lower latitude regions, a behavior also seen in previous studies of the response
            to aerosol forcing in different latitude bands
            <span><a>19</a></span>. However, substantial differentiation occurs within latitude bands. For example,
            emissions sourced from East Africa generate approximately four times more cooling
            (−0.06 ± 0.01 °C) than emissions from India (−0.02 ± 0.02 °C) at similar latitudes—demonstrating
            the importance of our region-by-region focus.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are also important regional distinctions in the degree to which the temperature
            changes due to aerosol emissions are likely to be concentrated in the emitting region
            versus being felt globally (Fig. 
            <a>1b</a>, placement relative to diagonals). Because aerosols generally remain concentrated
            near their source and most strongly influence surface temperature by attenuating incoming
            solar radiation to the regions they overlie, they cool the emitting region more strongly
            than the global mean in all cases (Figs. 
            <a>1b</a>, 
            <a>2</a>). However, although Indian emissions produce the smallest global-mean cooling effects,
            their impacts are much more strongly concentrated within the emitting region than
            for other regions. India experiences cooling from its own emissions at a level ~21
            times greater than the global mean (−0.42 ± 0.03 K versus −0.02 ± 0.01 K), while Western
            European, and Indonesian emissions generate localized cooling (−0.50 ± 0.06, and −0.14 ± 0.05 K,
            respectively) that is less than two times as great as the respective global-mean cooling
            (−0.29 ± 0.01, and −0.07 ± 0.01 K, respectively). As a result, even though Western
            European emissions produce ~14 times the global mean cooling effect of Indian emissions,
            India and Western Europe experience comparable regional-mean cooling from their own
            emissions. In other words, regions like Western Europe, Indonesia, and (to a slightly
            lesser extent) the United States strongly export the climate impacts of their emissions,
            while regions like India more strongly experience the cooling effects of their own
            emissions.

         <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Role of of aerosol burden and radiative forcing differences</div>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We find that differences in global-mean temperature response resulting from identical
            emissions emerge at each of several steps between initial emission and eventual temperature
            effect. Aerosol emissions impact temperature when their resulting atmospheric concentrations
            interact with atmospheric radiation, both directly and through aerosols’ rapid effects
            on cloud radiative properties and amount. These radiative interactions then modify
            the top-of-atmosphere energy balance, which creates a global-mean temperature change
            mediated by a series of feedback processes. Differences in the temperature change
            induced by each regional emission can emerge at each step in this process: from emission
            to atmospheric burden, from burden to top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing, and from
            top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing to temperature change.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The total atmospheric aerosol burdens generated by the identical regional emissions
            are spread between 128–233 Gg of sulfate aerosol, 9.29–15.7 Gg of black carbon aerosol,
            and 23.1–54.2 Gg of organic carbon aerosol (Supplementary Table 
            <a>1</a>; spatial distributions shown in Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>1</a>, 
            <a>2</a>, and 
            <a>3</a>, respectively). However, the atmospheric burdens of the individual aerosol species
            generated by each regional emission are largely uncorrelated with the regional emissions’
            relative potency at changing global-mean temperature (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>4</a>). Thus, the disparity in temperature effects does not arise solely from a disparity
            in the atmospheric lifetime and resulting atmospheric burden of aerosols emitted from
            each region, but also through the differential generation of climate forcing and feedbacks
            by those burdens.
            
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How do the aerosol burdens from each region’s emissions translate into radiative forcing,
            which in turn drives the global mean temperature change? The radiative effects of
            sulfate (a global-mean cooling agent), black carbon (a global-mean warming agent),
            and organic carbon (a global-mean cooling agent, though with minor shortwave absorbing
            properties) will counteract each other in driving the radiative forcing. This cancellation
            can be accommodated by using an aggregate measure of aerosol optical properties, such
            as aerosol optical depth. In order to capture the cancellation between the absorbing
            and scattering aerosol burdens, we calculate this as the ratio between the change
            in global-mean total aerosol optical depth and global-mean absorbing aerosol optical
            depth caused by each regional emission.
         </p>
         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ratio of total to absorbing aerosol optical depth explains approximately 60% of
            the variance (
            <span>R</span> = 0.60, 0.44–0.69) in global-mean top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing (ERF)
            from each regional emission (Fig. 
            <a>3a</a>). We calculate the ERF as the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance induced by the
            regional emission after the atmosphere and land surface has been allowed to respond
            (see Methods). The variance in ERF is thus largely explained by the rate of global-mean
            cancellation between the absorbing and scattering aerosol burdens resulting from each
            regional emission, arising from differences in aerosol mixing rates, relative altitudes,
            and other microphysical and radiative factors
            <span><a>30</a>,
               <a>31</a></span>. The remaining variance may be explained by (1) the radiative environment in which
            the aerosol population is interacting, created by regional differences in climatological
            cloud cover or background aerosol; or (2) the particular cloud/convective environment
            in which the aerosols are placed and the influence this has on the manifestation of
            the aerosols’ indirect and semidirect effects on clouds
            <span><a>32</a>,
               <a>33</a></span>. We find that the ratio of total aerosol optical depth to absorbing aerosol optical
            depth is approximately as well correlated with clear-sky ERF (
            <span>R</span> = 0.58, 0.31–0.61) as it is with the total ERF, indicating that the presence or absence
            of climatological cloud does not substantially impact the translation of the atmospheric
            aerosol burdens into radiative forcing.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the rate of global-mean cancellation between the absorbing and scattering
            aerosol burdens is somewhat correlated with the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing
            generated by each emitting region, the relative top-of-atmosphere effective radiative
            forcings are not well correlated with the relative global mean temperature change
            (Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>), indicating a substantial divergence in forcing efficacy depending on emitting region.
            The forcing efficacy of each regional emission—i.e., the global-mean temperature change
            per unit top-of-atmosphere effective radiative forcing (captured in Fig. 
            <a>4a</a> and by placement relative to the diagonal lines in Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>)—range from 0.24 ± 0.14 K(Wm

            <span>−1</span>. This constitutes a factor of five range in forcing efficacy between emitting regions,
            roughly twice the relative range in estimated forcing efficacy between global historical
            aerosols and greenhouse gases
            <span><a>7</a>,
               <a>34</a></span>. Emissions from the U.S. and Western Europe have the largest forcing efficacies (1.32 ± 0.06

            <span>−2</span>)
            <span>−1</span>, respectively), producing outsized temperature responses for the effective radiative
            forcing they generate. Emissions from regions like Brazil, meanwhile, produce a comparable
            effective radiative forcing to emissions from Western Europe or the U.S., but generate
            much smaller global-mean temperature change (Fig. 
            <a>3b</a>). These efficacy differences highlight the shortcomings of using global-mean radiative
            forcing to estimate the climate effects of highly regionalized forcings.

            </div>) to the initial radiative forcing generated by the emission (d
            <span>F</span>). Water vapor feedbacks show relatively small and uncorrelated differences in radiative
            gain across emitting region (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). However, surface albedo feedbacks—driven primarily by sea ice changes—and cloud
            feedbacks vary in correspondence with the differences in efficacy (Fig. 
            <a>4</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>6</a>). The regional differences in the combined radiative gain from the cloud and surface
            albedo feedbacks (Fig. 
            <a>4b</a>) explains 84% (
            <span>R</span> = 0.84, 0.71–0.91) of the variance in efficacy across regional emissions (Fig. 
            <a>4a</a>).

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences in radiative gain from surface albedo feedbacks and the associated
            forcing efficacies sort roughly by latitude of emissions. The surface albedo feedback
            is dominantly driven by sea ice changes (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>) in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and manifests in increased spatial extent and
            temporal duration of the sea ice. Forcing from Western European and Chinese emissions
            strongly increases sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic, inducing a strong surface
            albedo feedback radiative gain, while forcing induced by Indian and Brazilian emissions
            has relatively little effect. The sea ice responses are not strongly spatially collocated
            with the respective radiative forcings (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>5</a>) or atmospheric aerosol burdens (Supplementary Figs. 
            <a>1</a>, 
            <a>2</a>, and 
            <a>3</a>), indicating that the polar effects primarily result from changes in atmospheric
            circulations that control the energy balance of and/or sea ice dynamics in the polar
            regions, rather than in situ forcing or aerosol deposition onto the ice. This aligns
            well with previous studies that show strong dependence of sea-ice albedo feedbacks
            on the meridional placement of forcings
            <span><a>34</a>,
               <a>35</a></span>.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The inter-regional differences in radiative gain associated with cloud feedbacks also
            help to explain the inter-regional differences in forcing efficacy, and are partially
            driven by the climatological cloud environment with which each region’s aerosol emissions
            interact. Aerosols emitted in India, Indonesia, and Brazil produce large localized
            cloud changes (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7</a>), associated with the dynamical and thermodynamical effects of the localized aerosol
            forcing acting on the strongly convective cloud environment in these regions
            <span><a>36</a>–
               <a>39</a></span>. The cloud changes in response to all regional emissions are primarily dynamical
            or thermodynamical—rather than microphysical—in nature, as aerosol indirect effects
            (captured by the change in cloud droplet number concentration, Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7</a>) are locally confined and relatively uncorrelated with the maxima in cloud change.
            India’s strong cloud feedback gain and weak surface albedo feedback gain counteract
            each other in setting the relative overall efficacy of the radiative forcing from
            Indian emissions.

         <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In our simulations, the cloud feedbacks generated in several regions largely manifest
            through a north–south shift in tropical cloud cover (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>7</a>) associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This meridional ITCZ
            shift results from the large-scale atmospheric circulation adjusting to compensate
            for the hemispheric radiative imbalance induced by the localized aerosol forcing and
            its climate effects
            <span><a>40</a>–
               <a>43</a></span>. This is likely amplified by the surface albedo feedback to each regional emission,
            which will generate its own hemispheric energy imbalance
            <span><a>44</a></span>. Even in the presence of Southern Hemispheric emissions, Arctic sea ice increases
            more strongly than Antarctic sea ice in all cases (Supplementary Fig. 
            <a>8</a>). This is likely attributable to the stronger overall regional climate sensitivity
            of the Arctic relative to the Antarctic
            <span><a>45</a>–
               <a>47</a></span>. This common hemispheric imbalance in sea ice response contributes to the comparable
            ITCZ shifts seen in response to many of the regional aerosol emissions.
