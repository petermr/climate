      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine 100-year, repeating annual cycle simulations were conducted in CAM5 coupled to
         the mixed-layer ocean: one control simulation, and eight regionally perturbed simulations.
         The control simulation is a year 2000 climate with non-biomass burning anthropogenic
         black carbon, organic carbon, sulfur dioxide (SO
         <sub>2</sub>), and sulfate (SO
         <sub>4</sub>) emissions fields set to 1850 values. In each of the eight regionally perturbed simulations,
         the relevant region is populated with that region’s year 2000 values, scaled at every
         regional grid point and time step to achieve additional total annual emissions equivalent
         to China’s total year 2000 values: 22.4 Tg sulfate precursor, 1.61 Tg of black carbon
         emissions, and 4.03 Tg of organic carbon emissions. The 1850 and 2000 baseline emissions
         fields on which these are based are CAM5’s standard historical emissions fields
         <span><a>1</a></span>, and the resulting emissions fields used to drive simulations are publicly accessible
         to allow for replication in other model suites (see Data availability).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The eight regions were defined according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
         Change’s regional definitions, and are shown in Fig. 
         <a>1a</a>. These eight geopolitical regions were selected to sample major past, present, or
         projected future emitting economies located in a range of climate regimes. Western
         Europe and the United States, major emitting regions over the historical period, were
         chosen to sample the response to aerosols emitted in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude
         climate regions with different longitudinal locations and associated storm track regimes.
         India and China, current major emitting regions, were chosen to capture the response
         to two different monsoonal paradigms. The projected potential future emitting regions
         <span><a>62</a></span>, Indonesia, Brazil, East Africa, and South Africa, were chosen to assess the impact
         of aerosols emitted in the following respective climate regimes: the deep convective
         western Pacific warm pool region, the Pacific and Atlantic basin branches of the Intertropical
         Convergence Zone, and the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The regional signals cited
         throughout the manuscript are calculated as the difference between the corresponding
         regionally perturbed simulation and the control simulation over the final 60 years
         of each simulation.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although black carbon, sulfate, and organic carbon aerosol have somewhat opposing
         optical properties and global-mean top-of-atmosphere radiative effects, which can
         complicate analysis when they are co-emitted, we choose to include all of these species
         in each simulation. The species are co-emitted by many industrial processes, and their
         mitigation and growth often occur in tandem—a characteristic seen in their Representative
         Concentration Pathway and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway trajectories
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>29</a></span>. Analyzing the climate effects of their simultaneous mitigation or growth, therefore,
         is likely to provide a better proxy for the climate effects of economy-wide transitions
         in aerosol emissions, as has been the historical norm and as is projected across the
         current suite of emissions scenarios used by the climate modeling and policy communities.
         Simulations that include only one aerosol species may not be additive, particularly
         in regional responses
         <span><a>63</a></span>, reducing their utility in assessing the climate response to changes in multiple
         aerosol species simultaneously, as has been the dominant mode of aerosol emission
         change in reality. Future work will aim to illuminate the degree of additivity in
         the multi-species response through comparison with a planned suite of complementary
         single species simulations.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Effective radiative forcing (ERF) values are calculated using a suite of 9 CAM5 simulations
         formulated in the same way as the mixed-layer ocean simulations described above, but
         with the mixed-layer ocean and sea ice module replaced with a repeating annual cycle
         of observed year 2000 sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice coverage. These
         simulations are run for 60 years, the model equilibrates within the first 20 years,
         and the final 40 years of the simulation are used in the ERF calculation. The ERF
         is calculated as the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance between the control and
         regional fixed-SST simulation, i.e., after atmospheric and land surface temperatures
         have been allowed to adjust to the regional emissions. This follows the Fixed SST
         radiative forcing definition described in Myhre et al.
