      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These results demonstrate that geographic location substantially influences the cooling
         potential of a given aerosol emission. Crucially, countries that historically have
         or presently do account for the majority of anthropogenic aerosol emissions—Europe,
         the U.S., and China—are the regions whose emissions have the largest cooling potential.
         Meanwhile, regions with rapid current emissions growth and/or that are projected to
         be the dominant sources of anthropogenic emissions going forward—such as India and
         East Africa—have the smallest cooling potential. This suggests that the historical
         spatial distribution of anthropogenic emissions may have had a larger cooling potential
         than will the emissions distribution of the future. Aerosol emissions are projected
         to decline over the 21st century, as countries increasingly value the air quality
         benefits of aerosol mitigation
         <span><a>28</a>,
            <a>48</a></span>. However, these findings suggest that the rate at which anthropogenic aerosol emissions
         offset global-mean greenhouse gas-driven warming may decline more rapidly than changes
         in global total emissions alone would indicate, due to the additional effects of the
         simultaneous spatial redistribution of emissions.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While fully coupled climate models will capture the effects of these changes in overall
         rate of offsetting, the reduced form integrated assessment models (IAMs) and earth
         system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) used in many impact assessment settings
         would fail to capture this signal. The widely used dynamic integrated climate-economy
         (DICE) integrated assessment model, for example, assumes a time-constant translation
         of aerosol emissions into temperature effects in calculating future global-mean climate
         change
         <span><a>18</a></span>. It would therefore overestimate the future offsetting effect of anthropogenic aerosol
         emissions, if their global distribution evolves toward lower potency regions as our
         results suggest.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These findings have additional implications for estimates of climate sensitivity from
         historical observations. Estimates of the transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium
         climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of CO
         <sub>2</sub> have been attempted from global-mean historical temperature and forcing estimates
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. Recent studies have argued that the different efficacies of individual forcings
         operating over the historical period must be factored into these observationally-based
         estimates of TCR and ECS, but do so using time-invariant estimates of efficacy
         <span><a>11</a>,
            <a>13</a></span>. The TCR and ECS are estimated via a statistical fit through the distribution of
         temperature change versus forcing over historical observations, using the same efficacy
         across the time series. Results from this study suggest that the efficacy of global
         aerosol forcing may have evolved substantially over the historical period as different
         regional emissions dominated the global total emissions. This would suggest the need
         for a time-evolving value for overall aerosol forcing efficacy over the observational
         record, potentially resulting in different estimates of TCR and ECS from these methods.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the inequality in the climate impacts of aerosols from different emitting
         regions has substantial ramifications for climate accounting and aerosol mitigation
         policy. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing differences in relative
         climate influence at the scale of regional aerosol emissions, as aerosols are increasingly
         factored into international climate policy discussions. Studies to date on the climate
         influence of aerosols’ heterogeneity have primarily focused on the total global distribution
         or on atmospheric concentrations or radiative forcings within certain latitude bands
         <span><a>6</a>,
            <a>7</a>,
            <a>19</a></span>. The decisions influencing aerosols’ climate effects, however, manifest at the emissions
         level along political boundaries; increases are generally driven by national or multi-national
         economic policies that encourage emissions-intensive economic activity, while decreases
         have been largely driven by regional air quality concerns
         <span><a>48</a></span>. A mismatch, therefore, has existed until now between the regional scale and surface
         emissions framing of aerosol-relevant decision-making and the hemispheric scales and
         atmospheric focus of previous scientific analysis.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although aerosol emissions mitigation (or its opposite) has historically occurred
         outside the purview of climate policy, efforts are emerging to factor the climate
         damage from warming revealed by aerosol mitigation into cost-benefit analyses that
         have historically considered only air quality benefits. Our findings highlight that
         calculation of these climate damages must be regionally-specific, both in determining
         global-mean penalties from different emitting regions and in evaluating the regional
         distribution of those penalties. The pronounced divergence in forcing efficacies seen
         here for national-scale emissions changes—the scale at which climate accounting schemes
         and mitigation cost-benefit analyses will be undertaken—highlights the danger associated
         with using global-mean radiative forcing and metrics based on it, such as global warming
         potentials, as a universal conversion factor for aerosols’ global-mean climate impacts
         across different emitting regions. These results also suggest that for certain regions,
         such as India, climate impacts may be dramatically stronger in the mitigating region
         than outside it, while for others it may not. Such inter-regional differences will
         influence the rate at which the localized climate penalty from revealed warming counteracts
         the localized air quality benefits of the aerosol mitigation.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These factors demonstrate that evaluation of the social cost of climate impacts from
         aerosol mitigation will need to be more regionalized than for long-lived greenhouse
         gases. The particulars of the magnitude and spatial distribution of each regional
         emission’s temperature effects may differ depending on the climate model used, given
         the substantial spread that exists in model treatment of aerosol processes
         <span><a>49</a>–
            <a>51</a></span>. However, our results demonstrate that major inter-regional differences do emerge,
         with substantial scientific and policy implications, providing an important first
         step in motivating future multi-model assessment using the regional emissions framework
         laid out here.
