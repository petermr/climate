  <p id="Par50" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The availability of the QIDSS served as a facilitator to implementation. While there were a select number of practices where the QIDSS was not needed, this was limited to FHTs with in-house expertise to fulfill QIDSS-like responsibilities. In all other cases, a FHT’s participation in D2D was dependent on this resource. However, participants noted that at the time of data collection for this study, implementation support did not extend to the 
   <span class="italic">response</span> stage of the feedback loop. (Table

        <p>R: They would stop reporting. I shouldn’t say that. One would probably still report, the small FHT, that executive director. There’s where I have the QIP committee. So, one of them would, but the other two wouldn’t. (ID = 016).</p>
