 <p>We would like to thank all our colleagues of PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency, for their critical review of the accuracy of the data needed for the indicator assessment of the Trends and Pressures and City Blueprint Frameworks. We thank Johan Oost (Wetskills) for his help in contacting Asian cities, i.e., Ahmedabad and Taipei. This paper would not have been possible without the help and dedication of a group of enthusiastic master students to assess cities in Asia. Last but not least, we would like to thank all people involved the governance interviews who provided us with invaluable information. The City Blueprint Approach has been developed at KWR Watercycle Research Institute in the context of Watershare
