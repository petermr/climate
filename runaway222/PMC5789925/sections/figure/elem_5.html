            network (the red curve in 
            <span>A</span> and the green curve in 
            <span>B</span>) and three from the reduced model. In particular, the blue, black, and cyan traces
            in both panels are the effective abundances from the reduced model with unweighted,
            degree-weighted, and eigenvector-weighted averaging, respectively. The circles and
            asterisks curves in both panels indicate the cases where the initial species abundance
            is high (10) or low (0.01), respectively. The yellow curves represent the individual
            realizations for the original system and three types of reduced systems. For each

            </div>. The remarkable feature is that, if the original mutualistic network is random, all
            three types of reduced model can predict correctly the tipping point, regardless of
            the specific averaging process used in deriving the model. The key message is that
            the failure of the reduced model through unweighted averaging can be attributed to
            the lack of sufficient randomness in the real mutualistic networks.
