      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The radiative feedback framework is based on the analysis of changes to the energy
         balance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by a perturbation. An initial perturbation
         to TOA radiation, 
         <span>F</span> (in W m
         <span>−2</span>), is termed the ‘radiative forcing’ and is due, for instance, to a change in the
         atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
         <sub>2</sub>) or in solar irradiance. Consider as an example the response to a positive radiative
         forcing resulting from an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. This will initially
         lead to a decrease in outgoing longwave radiation, resulting in a TOA radiative imbalance
         and accumulation of energy within the climate system
         <span><a>117</a></span>. This in turn will trigger changes in the climate, in particular a temperature increase
         that leads to larger emissions of infrared radiation by the Earth. Ultimately, those
         larger emissions will compensate for the additional energy input due to the forcing.
         After some time, the climate system will come into a new equilibrium characterized
         by higher temperatures than before the perturbation was applied.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When studying the energy budget of the whole Earth, it is convenient to assume that
         the modification of the radiative fluxes emitted by the Earth is proportional to changes
         in global mean surface temperature 
         <span>T</span><sub>s</sub> (in K). The imbalance of the energy budget at the TOA averaged over the whole Earth
         at any time (Δ

         <span>λ</span> is negative for a stable climate and a larger absolute value corresponds to a less
         sensitive climate characterized by a smaller temperature change for a specific forcing.
         At equilibrium, when by definition the heat budget is balanced at the TOA (i.e., Δ
         <span>R</span> = 0), the surface temperature change in response to the perturbation is simply Δ

         <span>F</span>/
         <span>λ</span>. The equilibrium climate sensitivity, estimated as the global mean temperature change
         in response to a doubling of the CO
         <sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere, which corresponds to a radiative forcing 
         <span>F</span> of roughly 3.7 W m
         <span>−2</span>, is thus equal to −3.7/
         <span>λ</span>. The transient imbalance at the TOA corresponds to heat storage, which is mainly
         accounted for by the ocean, so the term Δ
         <span>R</span> is often approximated by the ocean heat uptake

         vapor and temperature, referred to as the feedback variables. The feedback related

         or cooling (black-body response or Planck feedback, denoted by
