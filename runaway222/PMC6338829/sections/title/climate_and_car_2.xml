 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relative to our baseline scenario, the natural carbon–climate feedback (net natural) increased atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> by 92 ppm (56–152 ppm), or about 15%, and temperature by 0.30 °C (0.19 °C–0.44 °C) from 1800 to 2100. The economic feedback (net economic), in contrast, decreased CO
  <sub>2</sub> by 85 ppm (ranging from an increase of 3.3 ppm to a decrease of 204 ppm), or 14%, and temperature by 0.29 °C (ranging from an increase of 0.01 °C to a decrease of 0.76 °C) over the same period. The combination of these two sets of effects in our fully coupled scenario reduced CO
  <sub>2</sub> by about 12 ppm (ranging from an increase of 156 to a decrease of 179 ppm) and had only a minor effect on temperature (

For the natural carbon cycle, effects from the land and ocean in our model were similar in magnitude. Temperature effects on GDP drove the net economic effect strongly down, and although the carbon intensity of energy (carbon intensity) response caused a slight increase, the overall effect was dominated by GDP. Both net natural and net economic simulations also had some nonlinear interaction effects that were not captured by our decoupled scenarios.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For both economic and carbon cycle parameters we derived upper and lower uncertainty bounds and propagated them through our model. Our upper bound on the relationship between GDP and temperature comes from the highest-impact scenario in Burke et al. (
  <a rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" href="#r19">19</a>), and our lower bound is the damage function from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model (
  <a rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" href="#r11">11</a>). For uncertainty related to climate effects on carbon intensity, we derived upper and lower bounds from estimates reported in the literature (see 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
   <span class="italic">SI Appendix</span>, 
   <span class="italic">SI Materials and Methods</span>
  </span>, for details). For our population and energy intensity scenarios we assumed upper and lower uncertainty bounds of ±50% because significant uncertainties exist in the current understanding of these relationships in the literature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Natural carbon cycle uncertainty estimates were derived from fitting to ±1 SD of the fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multimodel mean ocean and land carbon storage by 2100.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results demonstrate the potentially comparable magnitude of an economic carbon–climate feedback and indicate that this may act to substantially counter warming from the natural carbon–climate feedback. This apparent benefit to the climate is driven by large economic losses, so although we find that economic feedback processes do have the capacity to balance the additional warming from the natural carbon–climate feedback, this is achieved only through damages to the global economy.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon fluxes, atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> levels, and global mean surface temperatures in our fully coupled scenario were lower than in the net natural scenario, particularly as temperatures increased more rapidly after 2050 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3 
   <span class="italic">A</span>–
   <span class="italic">C</span>
  </a>). By 2100, economic damages from climate warming reduced GDP by 22% (5.9–61%) (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1805187115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

  </span>), which in turn (in the GDP scenario) lowered cumulative fossil fuel emissions by 304 Pg C (ranging from a decrease of 731 Pg C to an increase of 44 Pg C) or 14% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </a>). Temperature-driven decreases in the efficiency of energy production from fossil fuels increased the carbon intensity of energy in our model by 2.4% (ranging from a decrease of 0.51% to a decrease of 6.6%), which alone (in the carbon intensity scenario) drove a 24 Pg C increase (ranging from a 6 Pg C decrease to a 58 Pg C increase) in cumulative emissions relative to the baseline by the end of the century. This positive influence on emissions associated with climate effects on the carbon intensity of energy was more than offset by the negative effect of climate on GDP, so that together, economic processes in our fully coupled scenario reduced atmospheric CO
  <sub>2</sub> by 104 ppm (ranging from a decrease of 235 ppm to an increase of 3 ppm), or 15%, and global mean air temperature by about 0.32 °C (ranging from a decrease of 0.82 °C to an increase of 0.01 °C) from 1800 to 2100 relative to the net natural scenario (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). This effect on the carbon cycle is comparable in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to potential losses in permafrost over the next century (

Our GDP and population scenarios both result in negative effects on emissions, although the GDP effect is considerably more pronounced, whereas our energy intensity and carbon intensity scenarios contribute to slight increases in fossil fuel emissions.
