      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The early Earth was probably temperate. Continental and seafloor weathering buffer
         Archean surface temperatures to 0–50 °C. This result holds for a broad range of assumptions
         about the evolution of internal heat flow, crustal production, spreading rates, and
         the biotic enhancement of continental weathering. Even in extreme scenarios with negligible
         subaerial Archean land and high methane abundances, a hot Archean (&gt;50 °C) is unlikely.
         Sub-0 °C climates are also unlikely unless the Archean outgassing flux was unrealistically
         lower than the modern flux.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The seafloor weathering feedback is important, but less dominant than previously assumed.
         Consequently, the early Earth would not have been in a snowball state due to pCO
         <sub>2</sub> drawdown from seafloor weathering. In principle, little to no methane is required
         to maintain a habitable surface climate, although methane should be expected in the
         anoxic Archean atmosphere once methanogenesis evolved (ref. 
         <a>62</a>, chap. 11).

         about ocean chemistry, internal heat flow, and other carbon cycle parameterizations.
         Consequently, similar feedbacks may control ocean pH and climate on other Earthlike
         planets with basaltic seafloors and silicate continents, suggesting that life elsewhere
         could emerge in comparable environments to those on our early planet.
