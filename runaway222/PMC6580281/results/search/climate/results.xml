 <result pre="al., 2014; Ma et al., 2016). Most studies of historical" exact="climate" post="changes have focused on macroorganisms (Ma et al., 2016;"/>

 <result pre="forest, which is consistent with the effect of late Quaternary" exact="climate" post="change on macroorganism community composition (Feng et al., 2014;"/>
 <result pre="Svenning et al., 2015). This may be because late Quaternary" exact="climate" post="change was stronger in temperate regions than in tropic–subtropical"/>
 <result pre="in tropic–subtropical forests may have buffered this region against historical" exact="climate" post="changes (López‐Pujol &amp;amp; Ren, 2010), resulting in a smaller"/>
