         goal

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To identify emission pathways in Step 1 that were consistent with the stated mitigation
         targets, we developed a dynamic optimization model SCM4OPT (Su et al. 
         <a>2017</a>) based on the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model (Nordhaus 
         <a>1992</a>). To be able to apply the model for the analyses of ambitious targets such as a temperature
         increase of no more than 1.5 °C, it was designed to explicitly consider in its economic
         module mitigation of emissions of CO
         <sub>2</sub> as well as other gases/aerosols. The simple climate module in the DICE model was
         also improved to treat the behavior of the other gases/aerosols individually. See
         also Su et al. (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the assessment of the impacts of climate change corresponding to each temperature
         goal, process-based impact models for multiple sectors were used for future projections
         of impacts. The sectors covered are (a) agriculture (Sakurai et al. 
         <a>2014</a>), (b) terrestrial ecosystems (Ito et al. 
         <a>2016</a>), (c) water resources (Hanasaki et al. 
         <a>2013</a>), (d) floods (Hirabayashi et al. 
         <a>2013</a>), (e) health (Honda et al. 
         <a>2014</a>), and (f) marine bio-geochemical cycles and ecosystems (Yamamoto et al. 
         <a>2014</a>) (17 variables in total). The impact model analyses was coordinated to use the same
         set of climate scenarios from the selected five climate models which participated
         in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Taylor et
         al. 
         <a>2012</a>), namely GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROCESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M, for
         four levels (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP;
         Moss et al. 
         <a>2010</a>) and three Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1, 2 and 3; Riahi et al. 
         <a>2017</a>). The results of the impact models for the RCP scenarios were linearly interpolated
         according to global mean temperatures to estimate the impacts for each temperature
         goal. The validity of this linear scaling is discussed by Tanaka et al. (
         <a>2017</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The five climate models selected to represent climate uncertainties largely cover
         the upper and lower limits of the ranges of global mean temperature and precipitation
         projections generated by the CMIP5 climate model ensemble. However, they should be
         regarded as being only for illustrative purposes for detailed aspects of the projections
         such as geographical distributions and characteristics of temporal variabilities.
         As only a single impact model was used for each sector, uncertainties in the impact
         models were not explored. The socio-economic pathways were selected to explore a range
         of different levels of sustainability. Namely, in our project, the SSP1 was the most
         sustainable, followed by SSP2, and SSP3 was the least sustainable pathway, judged
         from their narratives and baseline GHG emissions, among other indicators.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the assessment of portfolios of mitigation options and associated economic impacts
         to achieve an emission pathway for each temperature goal, multiple integrated assessment
         models (IAMs), namely, MARIA (Mori 
         <a>2000</a>), AIM (Fujimori et al. 
         <a>2012</a>), EMEDA (Washida et al. 
         <a>2014</a>), and GRAPE (Kurosawa 
         <a>2006</a>), were employed. The use of multiple models enabled us to illustrate an indication
         of uncertainties caused by different model structures and assumptions. The variables
         assessed were GHG emissions and reduction pathways, GDP and consumption loss, energy
         supply and demand, technological options, land use and food supply and demand, and
         impacts for each industry and region. See Mori et al. (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature for more details of this part of ICA-RUS.
