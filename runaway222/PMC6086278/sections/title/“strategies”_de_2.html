      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">“Strategies” defined and assessed in ICA-RUS</div>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In ICA-RUS, we developed a concept of “strategies” of global climate risk management
         and defined through three steps described below (Fig. 
         <a>1</a>). The “strategies” are treated as risk management alternatives that are available
         to society. Note that the subject adopting a “strategy” in this sense is intended
         to be the human society or the global community as a whole through collective decision-making
         and actions, rather than any particular actor or group of actors. Breaking down a
         “strategy” into decisions and actions of each actor needs further discussion, which
         is not covered in this study.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mitigation targets are defined by three considerations: (a) target temperature level,
         (b) risk averseness, and (c) assumptions about the pathway. Here, the choice regarding
         risk averseness means deciding on the basis of scientific uncertainty how likely it
         is that the target temperature would be exceeded. The assumptions about the pathway
         include a choice as to whether “overshoot” (the concentration or temperature decreases
         after an initial increase) is allowed or not (Huntingford and Lowe 
         <a>2007</a>). The pathways of global GHG emissions consistent with these considerations were
         identified in Step 1.

         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of possible consequences for each mitigation target is determined taking
         into account various uncertainties, such as climate (and impact) uncertainties, uncertainties
         concerning mitigation actions, and socio-economic uncertainties. Climate uncertainties
         arise from uncertainties in the scientific estimates of factors such as climate sensitivity
         (Freeman et al. 
         <a>2015</a>). Uncertainties in mitigation actions arise from the possibility that a mitigation
         action considered necessary to achieve a target is only partially implemented, or
         else is fully implemented but does not prove as effective as anticipated, and gives
         rise to the risk that the temperature rise may be greater than initially projected
         (Mabey et al. 
         <a>2011</a>). Socio-economic uncertainties (excluding those relating to climate policy) arise
         from uncertainties in future projections of variables such as world population, economic
         development, and social inequality (Riahi et al. 
         <a>2017</a>).

            <div><span>Step 3:</span><div>
                  <p>Considering necessary adaptation levels (plus need for geoengineering).</p>
               </div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The necessary level of adaptation action is considered for each mitigation target
         and costs are estimated where possible. As a range of consequences is possible for
         each mitigation target due to the existence of various uncertainties, there is a risk
         that the temperature rise may exceed the target. It is, therefore, important to take
         this possibility into account when considering what adaptation action will be required.
         Where a mitigation target remains subject to the risk of a large temperature rise,
         consideration should also be given to geoengineering, and in particular to the use
         of solar radiation management (Royal Society 
         <a>2009</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, different “strategies” based on the above concept were only partially
         explored in ICA-RUS. In Step 1, different levels of overshoot were not assessed. In
         Step 2, uncertainties only due to climate sensitivity and socio-economic scenarios
         were explicitly considered. Finally, Step 3 was not systematically assessed and was
         discussed only conceptually. In particular, the lack of a comprehensive assessment
         of adaptation is a notable limitation of the project. Although we did assess certain
         aspects of adaptation for agriculture and health, the results are not described in
         this paper as it focuses on the overall results. None the less, we believe that the
         concept is useful for further research in the future, where those uncertainties and
         factors are more fully assessed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In ICA-RUS, we explored several “strategies” with different combinations of target
         temperature level and risk averseness. In this paper, however, we mainly discuss only
         three “strategies” which we eventually focus on. They are T15, T20, and T25 with the
         GHG emission scenario that would have a 66% probability of limiting the global mean
         temperature rise to no more than 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 °C, respectively, above the pre-industrial
         levels. From the next section, they are simply referred to as three different temperature
         goals rather than “strategies”.
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To briefly summarize our findings on different risk averseness, the results for a
         “strategy” with a 2.0 °C limit and an 80% probability for staying below the limit
         were broadly similar to those for 1.5 °C and 50%. Likewise, a “strategy” with a 2.5 °C
         limit and an 80% probability produced similar results for 2.0 °C and 50%. Although
         a 66% probability was adopted for the main “strategies” in ICA-RUS, as it is frequently
         used in the literature (e.g., Rogelj et al. 
         <a>2015</a>), we argue that the choice of risk averseness is one of the central factors in risk
         management and needs more discussion.
