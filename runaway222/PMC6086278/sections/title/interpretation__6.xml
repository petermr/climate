 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this section, we present an interpretation of the Paris goals in the light of our assessment described above (The ICA-RUS project was originally intended to provide alternatives in terms of long-term climate goals. However, in the Paris Agreement, the international community has already chosen long-term goals. Therefore, we changed the purpose of our project and made an interpretation of the Paris goals.)</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, we found in the above that temperature goals as low as 2 or 1.5 °C cannot necessarily be supported from a globally aggregated cost–benefit perspective, as far as we can tell within the scope of our assessment. Although maximizing the aggregated economic value is often seen as an objective principle to optimize a policy intervention, we should note that the adoption of this principle, which is a form of utilitarian approach, heavily involves value judgments. By value judgments, we mean judgments on a question like “what should be protected?”, “what should be avoided?”, or “what is acceptable/unacceptable?” To appreciate the grounds of the Paris temperature goals, values other than the globally aggregated economic value should be taken into consideration. As has been discussed in the literature (Okereke 
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">2010</a>), such values involve ethical dimensions, particularly a concept called “climate justice”, which draws attention to a structural social injustice that those who are least responsible (i.e., people in developing countries and future generations, who have emitted least amount of GHGs) suffer the most harm. The Paris temperature goals can be supported by an ethical position that such an inequality is unacceptable. Other grounds may come from concerns of crossing a “tipping point” of any sub-system of the Earth system (tipping element). Although the scientific understanding on tipping elements still has large uncertainties, and thus, our assessment of them is also limited; the lowest possible temperature goals might well be supported to reduce the risks of crossing any tipping point. This could also involve value judgments, as triggering a catastrophic change in the Earth system by the current generation, which entails grave consequences for future generations, is unacceptable by a certain ethical position. The issue of tipping elements is further discussed by Iseri et al. (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, actions needed to meet a temperature goal are not very clear, given the uncertainty in climate system (including climate sensitivity, carbon-cycle feedback, and possibly others). On the other hand, the emission goal of the Paris Agreement (net zero global anthropogenic GHG emissions in the second half of this century) is a clearer one in terms of actions needed. In that sense, seen from the framework of our assessment, we appreciate the Paris emission goal as a more “actionable” goal. The two kinds of goals, the temperature and emission goals, are roughly, but not precisely, consistent with each other, and the relationship of the two should be made clearer. This conclusion of our echoes that of Geden (
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">2016</a>)’s, who also recommended a net zero emissions’ target as an actionable one, although his conclusion was based on his political science arguments.
