      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Practically, we should start taking actions with estimated likely values (or ranges)
         of climate parameters and then adjust our mitigation pathways in the course according
         to the future reductions of uncertainties in climate parameters (so-called “learning”
         or “act then learn” approach; Yohe et al. 
         <a>2004</a>; Manne and Richels 
         <a>1992</a>). Hereafter, for simplicity, we use “climate sensitivity” as a single parameter representing
         uncertain processes in the Earth system, keeping in mind that other parameters (including
         the one for carbon-cycle feedback) can be important, as well (Friedlingstein et al.
         
         <a>2014</a>).
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The estimate of climate sensitivity is expected to be improved through an advancement
         of science. However, even without such an advancement, thanks to the future accumulation
         of the observed surface air temperature data, the uncertainty range of global mean
         temperature changes can be reduced (Shiogama et al. 
         <a>2016</a>). We suggest that this gradual improvement of the estimate of climate sensitivity
         through learning plays an essential role when we deal with uncertainties lying between
         the temperature and emission goals. The economic value of scientific information in
         this context is discussed by Mori and Shiogama (
         <a>2018</a>) in this Special Feature.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If we find in this process that the climate sensitivity is substantially lower than
         the current central estimate [~ 3 °C, the middle of likely range from IPCC (
         <a>2013</a>)], we can more reasonably aim at the 1.5 °C goal, as the emission path for aiming
         at 1.5 °C goal with climate sensitivity of a little more than 2 °C is almost equivalent
         to that for the 2 °C goal with a climate sensitivity of 3 °C.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the contrary, in case we find that the climate sensitivity is substantially higher
         than the central estimate, we should recognize that we are on the course of exceeding
         2 °C even when the emission goal is achieved. This case represents a possible gap
         between the Paris temperature and emission goals and needs more discussion.
