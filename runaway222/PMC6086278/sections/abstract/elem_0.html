      <p>We have assessed the risks associated with setting 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 °C temperature
         goals and ways to manage them in a systematic manner and discussed their implications.
         The results suggest that, given the uncertainties in climate sensitivity, “net zero
         emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the second half of this century” is
         a more actionable goal for society than the 2 or 1.5 °C temperature goals themselves.
         If the climate sensitivity is proven to be relatively high and the temperature goals
         are not met even when the net zero emission goal is achieved, the options left are:
         (A) accepting/adapting to a warmer world, (B) boosting mitigation, and (C) climate
         geoengineering, or any combination of these. This decision should be made based on
         a deeper discussion of risks associated with each option. We also suggest the need
         to consider a wider range of policies: not only climate policies, but also broader
         “sustainability policies”, and to envisage more innovative solutions than what integrated
         assessment models can currently illustrate. Finally, based on a consideration of social
         aspects of risk decisions, we recommend the establishment of a panel of “intermediate
         layer” experts, who support decision-making by citizens as well as social and ethical
         thinking by policy makers.
