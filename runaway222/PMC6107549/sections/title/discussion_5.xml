 <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The emerging picture of atmospheric dynamics is based on processes acting over wide ranges of scale occasionally interspersed with narrow scale range, quasi periodic processes, most notably the daily, annual and Milankovitch cycles. This picture not only clarifies the distinction between weather, macroweather and climate, it has implications for our understanding of spectra, intermittency and extremes. To make these obvious, we introduced spike plots that highlight hidden extreme jumps in series and transects, showing that the only regime plausibly compatible with Gaussian assumptions was macroweather in time. Unsurprisingly, Fourier analysis is sensitive to these jumps so that we expected (and found) random spikes in Fourier space (spectra) as well, potentially explaining numerous ephemeral claims of quasi-periodic behaviour.</p>
 <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The spikes have two features: they are clustered, occurring on sparse fractal sets, and their probability distributions have “fat” power law tails. Both features can be quantified by a codimension function 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(γ) that quantifies how the sparseness changes with resolution, and is itself determined by three parameters. The first was quantified by estimating the exponent 
  <span class="italic">C</span>
  <sub>1</sub> from the variation of the ratio of the first and RMS moments, another (α) by the curvature of 
  <span class="italic">c</span>(γ), and a final parameter (
  <span class="italic">q</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">D</span>
  </sub>) from log-log plots of the probabilities of exceeding thresholds. We argued that in the atmosphere, strong intermittency and extreme black swan events are ubiquitous and that this has numerous consequences including for spectral analysis and for distinguishing “normal”, “expected” extremes from tipping points.
