  <p>(a) (top panel): A wide scale range composite of temporal Root Mean Square (RMS) Haar temperature fluctuations with the data described in Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> in thick lines (from left to right, the solid curves are data set #1, bottom, #2, top #3), #4, #5, #7, #8). The dashed lines are reproduced from ref.

   </span> left to right, datasets #2, #6, #7, #8. Here as in b, the fluctuations were multiplied by the canonical calibration constant of 2 so that when the slopes are positive, the fluctuations are close to difference fluctuations. The various scaling regimes are indicated at the bottom. (b) (bottom panel): Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for spatial transects. The bottom aircraft (data set #9) and top (daily resolution, data set #10) data are in the weather regime (“W”), the line labelled “M” is in the macroweather regime (data set #11), and the one labelled (“C”), the climate regime (data set #12, see Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a> for details). At scales &gt;≈2500 km, the aircraft fluctuations from a single flight, have a dip caused by poor statistics. The breaks in the other (weather, macroweather and climate) transects only occur at scales of about 10,000 km (upper right).
