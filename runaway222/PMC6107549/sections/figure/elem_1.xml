  <p>(a) (top panel): Temperature spike plots for weather, macroweather, climate (left to right) and time and space (top and bottom). The solid horizontal black line indicates the expected maximum for a Gaussian process with the same number of points (360 for each with the exception of the lower right which had only 180), the dashed lines are the corresponding Gaussian probability levels 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 10
   <span class="sup">−6</span>, 
   <span class="italic">p</span> = 10
   <span class="sup">−9</span>, two of the spikes exceed 14; 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 10
   <span class="sup">−77</span>. The upper left is Montreal at 1 hour resolution (data set #3; these numbers refer to Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>), upper middle, Montreal at 4 month resolution (#4), upper right, GRIP at 240 year resolution (#5), lower left, aircraft at 280 m resolution (#9), ECMWF, space, one month, 1° in space (#11), Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20 CR), 140 year res, 2° in space at 45°N, (#12). (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) (middle panel): Left: similar to (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for time only, and all series have 1000 points; the original series (normalized by their standard deviations and displaced vertically by 15 units for clarity) are shown on the right in the corresponding order. Bottom to top: The data are from sets #1,#2, #3, #4, #5, #7, #8 (Table 
   <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). The “mC” and “MC” are for macro and mega climate respectively. The solid horizontal lines are the Gaussian levels corresponding to probability of 10
   <span class="sup">−3</span>, the dashed lines are for 10
   <span class="sup">−6</span>, 10
   <span class="sup">−9</span>. (c) (bottom panel): Same as (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) but for transects, bottom to top: length 1000 (aircraft, data #9), daily reanalysis (360 points, #10), monthly reanalysis, #11, 360 points, 140 year resolution, #12, 180 points.
