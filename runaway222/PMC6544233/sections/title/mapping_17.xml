 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After determining the yield change at the political unit due to climate change we mapped the result back at the political unit level. Each political unit contains grid cells that harvested a crop and we assign all these grid cells the same yield change impact. The results are thus valid only at the scale of the political unit for which data were available. In cases where sub-national data were not available there is a marked difference at the state or country borders. For example, Kazakhstan was studied at the country level only and therefore results are valid only at that scale and the contrast with for example the Russian Federation boundary are from mapping. In regions of the world where higher resolution information was available boundary effects are not present e.g. US-Mexico boundary for maize, India-Nepal-Bangladesh boundary for wheat or rice.</p>
