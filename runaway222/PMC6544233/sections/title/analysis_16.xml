  <sub>1</sub> and α
  <sub>2</sub> are the coefficients associated with the linear and squared time terms respectively. Time terms account for omitted variable bias. sP and sT are terms to account for the contribution of gradual/linear fluctuations in the main crop growing season average precipitation (temperature) conditions on crop yield; α
  <sub>3</sub> and α
  <sub>4</sub> are respectively the coefficients associated with the seasonal precipitation and temperature. P and T respectively represent precipitation and temperature. sP
  <span class="sup">2</span> and sT
  <span class="sup">2</span> are terms that account for the contribution of extreme/quadratic seasonal precipitation and temperature conditions respectively to crop yields. α
  <sub>5</sub> and α

  <sub>10</sub> are the coefficients associated with these two terms. Similarly we have terms aP
  <span class="sup">2</span> and aT

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Setting up our regression as time series analysis allows us to more accurately capture the effect of precipitation variations. This is because precipitation variations are highly heterogeneous and previous attempts that used panel regressions are less sensitive to precipitation variations [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref050">50</a>]. The setting up of this form of the model is uniquely to answer only questions on climate trends/mean climate change impact on crop yields for historical and current conditions. To answer other questions such as identifying temperature thresholds beyond which crops have severe yield losses other forms of model specifications are required, such as an eighth-order polynomial function of temperature [

  <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0217148.e001" href="#pone.0217148.e001">Eq 1</a> above) was thus constructed for each crop and political unit (the fitting method is QR decomposition). The model was next tested for significance at the p &lt; 0.05 levels (ANOVA F-statistics; NULL model is the average yield). If the linearly fitted model was significant it was then used to conduct predictions of yield for historical and current climate condition (which are in-sample predictions, as historical and current climate condition are within the range of observed weather–
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217148.g002" href="#pone.0217148.g002">Fig 2</a>). The difference in the predicted yield is the likely observed impact on crops yield due to mean climate change/climate trends at the level of the political unit (see more elaboration in 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217148.s001" href="#pone.0217148.s001">S1 Text</a> sections 2). Residuals were found to be normally distributed and not autocorrelated (

  <span class="sup">2</span> value in the linear regressions retained for this analysis from anywhere globally was in wheat (0.42 for the political unit of Ryazan oblast in the Central Federal region of the Russian Federation; the root-mean-squared error here was 0.4 tons/ha whereas the observed average yields are ~2.7 tons/ha/year). In all these cases, the goodness of fit test rejects the hypothesis of a lack of fit to the data (at the p = 0.05 level). Cross validation of model yield predictions against observations (2009 to 2013) showed low prediction errors (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have used a relatively simple statistical framework to tease out the main effects of changed climatic conditions on crop yields. A potential limitation of the analysis presented is that regression models were separately estimated within each geographical unit, thus we ignore spatial auto-correlations. Given our spatial scales–even though finer scaled compared to the country scale–each political unit nevertheless are hundreds to thousands of squared kilometers spatially–diffusion of agronomic knowledge and other socio-economic variables i.e. spatial autocorrelation effects would be relatively limited compared to analyses at much more finer spatial scales such as at village levels. Future studies should explore spatial and temporal multi-scale effects [
  <a rid="pone.0217148.ref050" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0217148.ref050">50</a>]; we do not consider potential physical interaction between the explanatory variables at different scales in different geographical units. We would also like to caveat against interpreting our regression-based analysis as causality. Needless to say, detailed studies using technically more complex statistical models, including causal models, and more extensive model diagnostics, is needed. Ignoring spatial autocorrelation does not necessarily bias the final results, however inclusion of such effects may improve the precision of the estimates. On the other hand, spatio-temporal statistical models can be computationally and mathematically very challenging. Future publications should try to address spatio-temporal dependency, diagnostics associated with statistical modeling and other issues mentioned above in global-scale studies.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For computing production change we multiplied the climate change driven yield change with the 5-year average harvested areas (2004–2008); for computing percentage yield change with respect to recent yields we similarly computed a 5-year average yield (2004–2008) at each political unit. Country- and global-scale numbers are similarly all harvested area weighted. Finally we determined the change in food calories in a country as the sum of all of individual crop impacts out of the maximum of ten crops studied; most countries did not harvest all ten crops.
