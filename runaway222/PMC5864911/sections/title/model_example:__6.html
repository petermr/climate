      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model by Eisenman
         <span><a>68</a></span> calculates an energy balance for a well-mixed box of ocean water, covered with ice
         of a single thickness (see Supplementary Information). When ice is present, the enthalpy
         E is negative and proportional to the ice thickness. In the absence of ice, E is positive
         and proportional to the ocean temperature. The bifurcation parameter L
         <sub>m</sub> represents the annual mean outgoing long-wave radiation budget at the surface (not
         including temperature feedbacks) and becomes smaller when the climate warms. For values
         of L
         <sub>m</sub> between approx. 65 W/m
         <span>2</span> (which roughly represents the present-day climate) and 50 W/m
         <span>2</span>, two stable solutions can be found: a seasonally ice-covered ocean and an ice-free
         ocean (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The solutions in Fig. 
         <a>5</a> are periodic in time because of the prescribed annual cycle in the long-wave budget
         L, and downwelling short-wave radiation, S. Figure 
         <a>5b–d</a> again displays the annual cycle for three distinct values of L
         <sub>m</sub> (red lines). In addition, we show to what state the sea-ice system would evolve if
         there was no annual cycle (green and blue lines). To this end, we fix S and L to the
         values corresponding to a particular day in a year and integrate the model forward
         in time, starting from large positive and negative E. For most days in the year, only
         one asymptotic solution exists. For example, under permanent summer conditions, all
         ice melts away and the ocean becomes so warm that the outgoing long-wave radiation
         balances the absorbed radiation (Fig. 
         <a>5</a>, green line). Under permanent winter conditions, the ice grows to an infinite thickness,
         because there is no negative feedback in the model to limit the ice growth. In such
         cases of failed convergence we artificially set the enthalpy to −7 GJ/m
         <span>2</span> (corresponding to a thickness of approx. 23 m). As the ice-ocean system cannot fully
         adjust to the fast insolation changes in the course of a year, the amplitude of its
         annual cycle is very small compared to the difference of its steady state solutions.
         The solutions overlap only during a short period in spring and an even shorter period
         in autumn, in the rest of the year only one solution exists. Nonetheless, the existence
         of multiple solutions still carries over to the periodically forced system for a certain
         parameter regime.
         
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bifurcations in this default model (Fig. 
         <a>5a</a>) can thus be understood from the change of the asymptotic solutions with L
         <sub>m</sub>. In a cold climate, the summer is too short and insolation is too low to melt enough
         ice within one summer; a perennial ice cover is therefore the only solution of the
         periodically forced system. Under global warming (decreasing L
         <sub>m</sub>), the asymptotic solution moves to larger E and the melting season becomes longer
         (Fig. 
         <a>5c</a>); this is where the periodically forced system has multiple solutions, balancing
         between the cold and warm attractors. Finally, the winter becomes too short for the
         formation of sea ice thick enough to survive the following summer, and the ice-free
         solution is the only one that remains (Fig. 
         <a>5d</a>).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the fact that a certain comprehensive model does not show multiple
         solutions under the same external conditions does not automatically suggest that tipping
         points are not possible. This has two reasons: First, tipping points can remain hidden
         in a parameter range related to periodic forces that is not explored when varying
         one parameter (such as CO
         <sub>2</sub>) alone. As Eisenman’s single column model above shows, the existence of multiple
         equilibria under fixed seasonal conditions in a model is a ‘smoking gun’ pointing
         to a strong positive feedback. Such a feedback indicates that the system is prone
         to tipping points even if the multistability is not apparent in the seasonally forced
         (non-autonomous) system. Changes in the insolation forcing (for instance due to changes
         in the annual cycle of cloud cover) can hence bring the system into a regime where
         abrupt changes are possible. The same can occur due to changes in the intrinsic relaxation
         time of the system, for instance related to the fact that the growth rate of sea ice
         depends on its thickness and hence the background climate
         <span><a>69</a>,
            <a>70</a></span>. Second, abrupt shifts can also occur in systems without multiple states. Specifically,
         the freezing point of water acts as a natural threshold for the formation of sea ice,
         making ice cover very sensitive on temperature in a certain regime and prone to reversible
         abrupt shifts
         <span><a>64</a></span>. The quasi-periodic changes in insolation related to Milankovitch forcing might therefore
         switch the Arctic back and forth between an ice-free and a seasonal ice regime (in
         analogy to the monsoon switches outlined above). A similar switch-mechanism determining
         the growth and melt of ice sheets has also been discussed as an explanation of ice
         ages during the Pleistocene
