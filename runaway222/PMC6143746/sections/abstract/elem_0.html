      <p>The data described in this article are sets of daily rainfall values derived from
         observed station records. The data was recorded by 72 in-situ rain gauges spread over
         the West African Sahel. The daily rainfall time series from synoptic, climate, agro-meteorological,
         and rainfall stations are assessed for quality and consistency before extreme values
         are extracted based on 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile thresholds. This data is free
         for use as part of the study "Scales for rating heavy rainfall events in West African
         Sahel" 
         <a>[1]</a> (Salack et al., 2018). Complementary and up to date time series can be taken from
         WASCAL data infrastructure (WADI) geoportal
