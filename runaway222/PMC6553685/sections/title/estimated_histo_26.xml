 <p>Data from the CDIAC on carbon emissions due to fossil-fuel burning and land-use changes, during the years 1800-2014. Land-use data is only available from 1850-2005 and so we linearly extrapolate (dashed line) to match the range of the fossil-fuel data. The sum of the emission trajectories is used to drive the model up to the year 2014, from which point the behavioural component of the socio-climate model is initiated.</p>
