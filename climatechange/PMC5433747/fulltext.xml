Species interactions and dispersal capacity are important mediators of community responses to climate change. The interaction between multispecies competition and variation in dispersal capacity has recently been shown to exacerbate the effects of climate change on diversity and to increase predictions of extinction risk dramatically. Dispersal capacity, however, is part of a species&#x02019; overall ecological strategy and are likely to trade off with other aspects of its life history that influence population growth and persistence. In plants, a well-known example is the trade-off between seed mass and seed number. The presence of such a trade-off might buffer the diversity loss predicted by models with random but neutral (i.e. not impacting fitness otherwise) differences in dispersal capacity. Using a trait-based metacommunity model along a warming climatic gradient the effect of three different dispersal scenarios on model predictions of diversity change were compared. Adding random variation in species dispersal capacity caused extinctions by the introduction of strong fitness differences due an inherent property of the dispersal kernel. Simulations including a fitness-equalising trade-off based on empirical relationships between seed mass (here affecting dispersal distance, establishment probability, and seedling biomass) and seed number (fecundity) maintained higher initial species diversity and predicted lower extinction risk and diversity loss during climate change than simulations with variable dispersal capacity. Large seeded species persisted during climate change, but developed lags behind their climate niche that may cause extinction debts. Small seeded species were more extinction-prone during climate change but tracked their niches through dispersal and colonisation, despite competitive resistance from residents. Life history trade-offs involved in coexistence mechanisms may increase community resilience to future climate change and are useful guides for model development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsr&#x000e5;det Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was financed by the Strategic Research Programme EkoKlim, Stockholm University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.su.se/ekoklim">www.su.se/ekoklim</ext-link>), through the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.formas.se">www.formas.se</ext-link>).

Climate driven range dynamics can cause community reorganisation and extinctions [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An improved understanding of climate change effects on range shifts, changes in community composition and extinction risk is needed to anticipate and mitigate diversity loss.</p><p>The most widely used method to estimate species range shifts in response to climate change is correlative species distribution modelling (SDM) which interprets the current observed range as a species&#x02019; bioclimatic niche and projects this range to future, altered climate conditions [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. SDMs have been criticised for ignoring potentially crucial ecological factors including demography, dispersal limitation and source-sink dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], as well as species interactions [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While recently more complex models have been proposed (e.g. SDM hybrids, range dynamic models [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), traditional SDMs remain popular due to low data requirements and relative ease of use. To better select the appropriate level of model complexity, we need to understand which factors have the largest impact on modelling outcomes and which can potentially be ignored [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Theoretical models can be deployed to compare assumptions, study mechanisms and generate hypotheses. Here, I use a simple metacommunity simulation model to study the effect of assumptions about species interactions (the strength of interspecific competition) and dispersal ability on model predictions regarding species range shifts, extinction risk and diversity loss following climate change. Model assumptions are formulated based on functional traits, allowing to include detailed yet general ecological characteristics.</p><p>One aim is to highlight the utility of known variation and covariation in life history traits for model development. Modelling species niches based on traits can investigate effects of increased ecological realism without loosing generality [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In such mechanistic models, population processes such as growth or reproduction are linked explicitly to the abiotic and biotic environment via traits that affect species fitness as a function of the environment [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Species niches and ranges thus emerge from first principles, i.e. trait-based fitness functions that can simulate both species sorting (environmental filtering) and limiting similarity (competitive exclusion). Importantly, known covariation and trade-offs between traits that combine to constitute the life history strategy of species can be used to guide and formulate model assumptions.</p><p>Here I focus on the interactive effects of competition and dispersal. Biotic interactions and dispersal capacity are increasingly acknowledged as factors that can influence species responses to climate change [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Species grow, reproduce and disperse in landscapes filled with potential competitors. When environmental conditions change, species interactions [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and species-specific dispersal capacity [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] mediate the ability of species to track their moving niches. Competition from resident species, for example, may pose resistance to colonisation of species that undergo a range shift [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Dispersal dynamics can either maintain populations in habitat that is no longer suitable (source-sink dynamics; [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), or prevent spread to habitat that becomes suitable but that cannot be reached (dispersal limitation; [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Modellers most often assume no dispersal or universal dispersal during range shifts, irrespective of species differences or spatial distance, but assumptions about dispersal significantly affect model predictions of biodiversity loss [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using a trait-based simulation model, Urban et al. [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] explored the effect of interspecific differences in dispersal capacity on diversity patterns in communities of competing species under climate change. They showed that increasing the differences between species in dispersal capacity resulted in higher predicted extinction risk. This effect was not only due to direct extinction of species with low dispersal capacity that were unable to track their climatic niche, but also due to an interaction with competition: better dispersers tracked changing climates better and then out-competed poorer dispersers.</p><p>However, dispersal capacity in their model was unrelated to any other trait or demographic variable. In reality, poor dispersers are likely to have evolved other strategy components that would balance the costs of poor dispersal and reduce fitness differences between dispersal strategies [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Informed by known trait covariation patterns in plants, I here extend a similar model to include trade-offs between dispersal capacity and other life history characteristics.</p><p>One of the fundamental plant ecological strategy axes with ramifications for dispersal capacity is the trade-off between seed mass and seed number [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Plants can either direct their reproductive investment into few large seeds or many small seeds [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Seed mass varies 5 to 6 orders of magnitude between species, even within communities [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This overdispersion of seed mass in local communities, as opposed to convergence to a single optimum seed mass, suggests that seed mass may be involved in a coexistence mechanism.</p><p>The mechanism by which the seed mass&#x02014;seed number (SMSN) trade-off enables coexistence is still debated [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but there is evidence for a range of relationships of seed mass with demographic rates. Small seeded species produce more seeds and gain a numerical advantage during colonisation [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and also may disperse farther [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], thus reaching more sites. Large seeded species have been suggested to have higher emergence probability [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], seedling survival [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], seedling competitive ability [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or stress tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Competition-colonisation trade-offs were the initial theoretical formulation for a spatial coexistence mechanism based on these patterns [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], but have been criticised for the unrealistic requirement of strict competitive hierarchies [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. More recently, the coexistence mechanism has been conceptualised as establishment-colonisation trade-off, acting on the tension between selection for larger seeds due to higher emergence and establishment success and selection for smaller seeds due to higher colonisation rates [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As underlying cause of this pattern, a tolerance-fecundity trade-off has been proposed, where large seeds have higher establishment success due to greater stress tolerance, while small seeds are advantageous in colonisation due to their greater numbers [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The concept is corroborated by results from a dataset on 50 co-occurring grassland species from Jakobsson and Eriksson [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], where higher emergence probability and greater seedling biomass of larger seeds led to greater recruitment success, while smaller seeds had access to a larger number of recruitment opportunities due to greater seed numbers [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. I use this dataset to parameterise the SMSN trade-off scenario in the present model. Assuming that dispersal capacity is related to seed mass [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], I exploit this established seed mass-seed number trade-off to examine its effect on model predictions.</p><p>The model simulates dynamics of a metacommunity of annual plants along a warming climatic gradient, where each species is characterised by its thermal niche optimum and seed mass (determining mean dispersal distance). It is used to address the following questions: (1) Do assumptions about dispersal (three scenarios) affect predicted changes in extinction risk and regional diversity?, (2) Does the effect of competition differ under differing assumptions regarding dispersal?, and (3) What are the mechanisms that cause differences in model outcomes and how do they depend on the seed mass distribution of the community?</p><p>Dispersal assumptions are examined using three scenarios of increasing ecological realism: (i) a <italic>uniform dispersal</italic> scenario, where all species have the same dispersal capacity and vital rates, (ii) a <italic>variable dispersal</italic> scenario, where species differ in dispersal capacity but have equal other vital rates, and (iii) a SMSN <italic>trade-off scenario</italic> where differences in dispersal capacity between species trade off with fecundity, establishment probability, and seedling biomass. Dispersal capacity and trade-offs are based on observed seed mass distributions and empirical relationships with seed mass.

Only competitive exclusion acting on relative fitness differences between species could cause extinctions. Note that the term &#x02018;fitness&#x02019; here is used generically to indicate relative fitness differences between species that arise from an interaction of the degree of adaptation to current conditions (match or mismatch between a species&#x02019; thermal niche optimum and the experienced temperature) and the efficiency of dispersal and establishment that allows species to track their thermal niche optimum.

In the variable dispersal scenario, this caused a strong competitive advantage for large seeded species and decreased regional diversity relative to other scenarios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177778.s002">S1D Fig</xref>). While large seeds could not disperse far, once established they locally deposited more seeds than smaller seeded species, leading to higher initial biomass and a competitive advantage of larger seeded species. Local pre-emptive dominance of large seeded species (due to positive density dependence) influenced regional species distribution patterns more than dispersal between patches.</p><p>In the <italic>trade-off scenario</italic>, this pattern of increased dominance of fewer species was less pronounced. The SMSN trade-off reduced the fitness differences introduced by the kernel effect, in spite of higher seedling biomass of larger seeded species in the trade-off scenario.

An establishment-colonisation trade-off maintained higher levels of species coexistence.

For these communities, most species dispersed far (beta diversity stayed low) and were able to track their optimum niche better than in the uniform scenario. This increased regional competition for thermal niches, thereby causing extinctions. In the variable dispersal scenario, resistance to colonisation from established species was strong and the few largest seeded species suppressed and excluded their competitors. With high SM variation, regional diversity loss was weaker than under uniform dispersal as species had broader ranges and patches remained more similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). With larger SM means and lower variation, local persistence maintained relatively high species numbers, even for species outside their optimal ranges, but diversity loss was greater. Dispersal dynamics were less prevalent here. Instead, shifts in relative abundances of species present before climate change caused a decrease in evenness.

Most extinctions occurred with small SM means and increasing variation, where many good dispersers tracked their shifting niches and competed in the colonisation of new patches.

Diversity remained relatively high (only decreasing somewhat for the largest SM means and lower SM variation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), but here persistence and competitive dominance of large seeded species prevailed instead of the dispersal driven dynamics with smaller means and higher variability. Nonetheless, a combination of dispersal and persistence appeared to maintain higher levels of diversity over much of parameter space. The trade-off essentially reduced and equalised the fitness differences introduced by the kernel effect. Due to higher fecundity (SN), smaller seeded species more often succeeded in colonising new patches in spite of competitive resistance from residents. The superiority of large seeds in the variable dispersal scenario was balanced by the trade-off to a degree where the mean of a given SM distribution was selected for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), and coexistence of species with different seed masses was maintained.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Lag in climate tracking and seed mass</title><p>The lag of species in tracking their climate optimum was lowest in communities with small SM means, where most species dispersed well. In communities with large SM means, species were not able to track their niche via dispersal and stayed far behind their optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Climate tracking was worse in the <italic>variable dispersal scenario</italic>, because here species seldom succeeded in colonisation of new patches due to resistance from large seeded local residents.

[<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Introducing an empirically based trade-off between dispersal capacity and other demographic rates however, buffered this effect to a large degree, raising the question of required and appropriate levels of model complexity.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Scenarios differed because dispersal assumptions mediated competitive effects</title><p>Competition in the present model was the driver of all species extinctions. Because species had thermal niches that were broad enough to allow persistence even after climate change, only competitive interactions could cause local or regional exclusion and extinction. Competition caused species and diversity loss by a number of mechanisms: i) depression of population abundances and local evenness, which increases extinction risk, ii) competitive exclusion of species that could persist in the absence of competitors, iii) pre-emptive dominance of local residents that poses competitive resistance to colonisation, which slows down range shifts and can cause extinctions [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The strength and relative importance of these mechanisms differed between scenarios because relative fitness differences between species were strongly dependent on the respective assumptions (<xref rid="pone.0177778.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>With equal dispersal capacities (<italic>uniform scenario</italic>), competitive differences between species arose solely from indirect effects of local climates on species growth rates. Species sorting was according to thermal optima only. The uniform scenario thus established effects of competition due to thermal niche differentiation and competitive exclusion of maladapted species. Some competitive resistance to colonisation occurred, but when all species had high dispersal capacity and hence relatively low local deposition probabilities, the pre-emptive dominance of resident species was weak and colonisation by better adapted species could occur.</p><p>Adding differences in dispersal capacity (<italic>variable dispersal scenario</italic>) immediately introduced unexpectedly strong differences in relative fitness between species, akin to a colonisation-competition trade-off [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Stronger competition here had the greatest negative effect on regional coexistence and diversity and caused the most extinctions during climate change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This reproduces results of the one other study that modelled effects of variation in dispersal capacity on community climate change responses under multispecies competition [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the mechanism causing this pattern here was found to be a different one. Urban et al. [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] interpreted their results as caused by better dispersers that outrun worse dispersers in the pursuit of their shifting niches, to then outcompete them. By studying the regional abundance weighted mean seed mass and the correlation between seed mass and climate tracking, I clearly show that here a different mechanism caused the strong diversity declines in this scenario. Specifically, bad dispersers with large seed mass were selected for due to a strong local competitive advantage that enabled maladapted species to persist via pre-emptive dominance and cause resistance to colonisation from good dispersers. As a consequence, good dispersers were least able to track their shifting niches (negative correlation between SM and lag in climate tracking, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Local compensatory dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], not dispersal, determined community responses to climate change. This situation corresponds to the &#x02018;boxcar effect&#x02019; described by Urban et al. [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where species can only expand their ranges northwards once local competitors are weakened enough to allow colonisation. Yet the pattern was caused solely by the kernel effect: lowering the mean dispersal distance of a species decreases not only the maximum distance that can be reached but also greatly increases the probability of local deposition. The kernel effect is particularly strong for the exponential power kernel used here, which can overestimate local seed deposition [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Nonetheless it is implicit in the mathematics of a range of different dispersal kernels, and should be kept in mind when manipulating mean dispersal distances.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>The seed mass &#x02013; seed number trade-off increased coexistence and buffered climate change effects</title><p>Variation in seed mass in the variable dispersal scenario caused a bias towards competitive superiority of larger seeds due to the kernel effect, such that coexistence and resilience under changing conditions were severely impaired. The modifying addition of the SMSN trade-off in the <italic>trade-off scenario</italic>, parameterised as far as possible by empirical data, buffered much of the predicted diversity loss by reducing the unrealistically strong fitness differences caused by the kernel effect. The trade-off between seed mass and seed number had an equalising effect [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that allowed for higher levels of coexistence during both stable climates as well as under climate change.</p><p>Higher initial species richness and diversity in the trade-off than the variable dispersal scenario already provided for higher response diversity of dispersal capacities, which conferred resilience to the metacommunity and contributed to less loss under climate change [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The SMSN tradeoff enabled coexistence and higher levels of evenness in a much wider region of parameter space. Competitive dominance of large seeds was broken by the seed mass-seed number trade-off, and small seeded species were able to track their thermal niches during climate change, when their advantage in dispersal capacity could play out.</p><p>The fitness equalising power of the implemented trade-off was surprising, as larger seeded species here had the additional advantage of higher emergence probability and greater initial seedling biomass, on top of higher local deposition probabilities due to the kernel effect. Nonetheless, these advantages were compensated by the higher fecundity and greater seed numbers of smaller seeded species, which could survive via a regional rescue effect. Under climate change, this preserved higher richness and diversity. Model results thus confirm that life history trade-offs involving seed mass underlie a coexistence mechanism based on an establishment-colonisation trade-off [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

For small means and increasing variability, a <italic>spatial mechanism</italic> was at play that enabled true range shifts. Extinction risk during CC was highest here, mainly for the smallest seeded species, but evenness (diversity) also remained high due to spatial dynamics: dispersal was efficient enough in most species for high rates of colonisation and a regional rescue effect during climate change. Species in such communities were better at tracking their optimum climate, exhibiting the lowest lags. In the variable dispersal scenario, however, these dynamics were strongly impaired by the local dominance of large-seeded species that resisted colonisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In the trade-off scenario smaller seeds more often overcame colonisation resistance and thus tracked their niches more closely, which lead to smaller lags in climate tracking for smaller seeded species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The establishment-colonisation trade-off [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] played out, but only at SM means at and below the empirical mean and increasingly for increasing SM variation, corresponding roughly to the parameter space above the diagonal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177778.g003">Fig 3C</xref>.</p><p>For communities with larger SM means and low variability, richness and diversity were maintained by a <italic>persistence mechanism</italic>: large seeded species, once established, were able to maintain high population abundances even when environmental conditions become suboptimal.

Ultimately, this creates an extinction debt [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and in the long run, these species might decline further unless they are able to adapt.

This leptokurtic kernel has the advantage of capturing long distance dispersal, but could overestimate local deposition probabilities [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Adaptations for different dispersal vectors (e.g. wind, water, animals) and the possibility that multiple vectors sequentially contribute to dispersal further modify species&#x02019; mean dispersal distances and complicate accurate modelling of the seed shadow [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0177778.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].

The strength of interspecific competition, determining the speed of competitive exclusion, will interact with the velocity and variability of local manifestations of climate change.

If we believe that some general insight can be gained from the simple model presented here, then we might conclude that naturally diverse communities could in fact prove to be more resilient to environmental change than sometimes feared.</p><p>Increasing the ecological realism of models that forecast diversity changes is important, but caution regarding model assumptions is essential [<xref rid="pone.0177778.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The addition of dispersal distance differences without considering a trade-off with other life history characteristics introduced unrealistically strong fitness differences between species that might cause us to overestimate extinction risks. Predictions for regional diversity loss from the ecologically more detailed SMSN trade-off scenario were more similar to the simplest assumptions of equal dispersal for all species. However, dispersal capacity did matter for the climate change response of individual species. Large seeded species were more likely to persist through climate change, but developed substantial lags behind their climate niches, possibly causing extinction debts. Small seeded species were more prone to extinction during climate change when facing strong competitive resistance from residents, but also tracked their niches better and underwent adaptive range shifts.</p><p>While the present implementation of the seed mass&#x02014;seed number trade-off probably still represents a major simplification, it serves to demonstrate the value of known life history strategies and trait covariation for model development and the formulation of model assumptions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177778.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Model details.</title><p>S1 Appendix provides a more detailed description of the model, simulation setup, parameter values and empirical justification.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177778.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177778.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Equilibrium richness and diversity in different scenarios, for increasing levels of competition.</title><p>Differences during stable climates between the three scenarios uniform (U), variable (V), and trade-off (T) dispersal, for different strengths of interspecific competition (alpha).
