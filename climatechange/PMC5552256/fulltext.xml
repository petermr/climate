Since development depends on temperature and drought, there is a concern that future climate change could lead to the spread of PWD infections. We evaluated the risk of PWD in 21 susceptible <italic>Pinus</italic> species on a global scale. The MB index, which represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature and 15 when the mean monthly temperatures exceeds 15&#x000b0;C, was used to determine current and future regions vulnerable to PWD (MB &#x02265; 22). For future climate conditions, we compared the difference in PWD risks among four different representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We also evaluated the impact of climate change on habitat suitability for each <italic>Pinus</italic> species using species distribution models. The findings were then integrated and the potential risk of PWD spread under climate change was discussed. Within the natural <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution area, southern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia were categorized as vulnerable regions (MB &#x02265; 22; 16% of the total <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution area). Representative provinces in which PWD has been reported at least once overlapped with the vulnerable regions. All RCP scenarios showed expansion of vulnerable regions in northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America under future climate conditions. By the 2070s, under RCP 8.5, an estimated increase in the area of vulnerable regions to approximately 50% of the total <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution area was revealed. In addition, the habitat conditions of a large portion of the <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution areas in Europe and Asia were deemed unsuitable by the 2070s under RCP 8.5. Approximately 40% of these regions overlapped with regions deemed vulnerable to PWD, suggesting that <italic>Pinus</italic> forests in these areas are at risk of serious damage due to habitat shifts and spread of PWD.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>S14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsui</surname><given-names>Tetsuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Environmental Research and Technology Development Fund (S-14, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.env.go.jp/policy/kenkyu/suishin/english/index.html">http://www.env.go.jp/policy/kenkyu/suishin/english/index.html</ext-link>) of the Ministry of the Environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.env.go.jp/">http://www.env.go.jp/</ext-link>), Japan.

The pine wood nematode (PWN, <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>) is the causal agent, while pine sawyer beetles (<italic>Monochamus</italic> spp.) act as a vector. PWN is thought to originate in North America [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and thus, its wide distribution throughout the country is not associated with the epidemic disease [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], even though several <italic>Pinus</italic> species are susceptible to PWN [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, in Asia and Europe, PWN is an invasive pathogen introduced artificially from PWD-affected countries and subsequently causing damage to native <italic>Pinus</italic> trees [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>PWD causes significant damage to forestry, local economies, and the ecologies of affected countries, degrading the quality and decreasing the quantity of pine wood products. In Japan, for example, the annual loss of pine wood as a result of PWD was more than 100 million m<sup>3</sup> across 11 years between 1978 and 1988 and more than 50 million m<sup>3</sup> between 1989 and 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The total financial loss, to date due to PWD in Japan is thought to be approximately 3700 million US dollars, assuming a market price of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>densiflora</italic> of US$ 100 / m<sup>3</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. From an ecological viewpoint, the loss of pine trees also reduces ecosystem functions and services, decreasing habitats for wild animals [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and affecting soil erosion [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Once introduced into a region, PWN spreads rapidly to neighboring areas through vector beetles or accompanying human activity [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Control is therefore labor-intensive and costly [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], highlighting the importance of identifying vulnerable areas and prioritizing control measures.</p><p>The occurrence of PWD is associated with high temperatures and moisture deficits [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the risk increasing with mean summer temperatures exceeding 20&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Modelling techniques aimed at evaluating PWD risk have been developed based on the dispersal capacity of the insect vector, human accidental transportation [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the physiological processes of host trees [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, these studies focus on East Asia and Europe, with the potential PWD risk in other distribution areas of <italic>Pinus</italic> species remaining unclear.</p><p>The occurrence and spread of PWD is also likely to be affected by future climate change [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is thought to be highly probable according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The increases in mean temperature and drought as a result of climate change could promote the spread of PWD into areas where the risk is low under current climatic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, it has also been suggested that under cool climate conditions some PWNs, having infected <italic>Pinus</italic> trees, do not cause disease symptoms for a number of years [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, increasing temperatures in the future could also activate these latent nematodes. Understanding the changing risks with climate change will therefore facilitate the establishment of measures aimed at prevention of future PWD outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, few studies have yet to evaluate the resulting risks under future climate change scenarios.</p><p>Climate change will also have direct effects on the growth of <italic>Pinus</italic> forests, with increasing temperatures negatively affecting the forest growth via aridification of regions where droughts is the primary constraint of growth and productivity [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, changes in temperature and precipitation constitute a significant threat to <italic>Pinus</italic> forests, even if undamaged by PWD. Increasing temperatures also affect host susceptibility to pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, areas where habitat suitability for <italic>Pinus</italic> species is likely to decrease in the future will be at high risk of PWD occurrence. Projecting the impact of climate change on both PWD risk and habitat suitability in <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution areas is therefore important in terms of understanding those areas vulnerable to PWD.</p><p>The aims of the present study were to evaluate the PWD risk in 21 <italic>Pinus</italic> species on a global scale and determine current and future changes in vulnerable regions with climate change. The MB index [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature and 15 when the mean monthly temperature exceeds 15&#x000b0;C, was used to determine vulnerable regions under current and future climate conditions. We also evaluated the impact of climate change on habitat suitability for each of the 21 <italic>Pinus</italic> species then integrated all the findings in order to discuss the potential risk of PWD spread under future climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The global distribution of PWD</title><p>Globally, Asia is most severely affected by PWD.

According to the concept of effective accumulative temperature, the MB index represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature (Tm) and 15 when the mean monthly temperature exceeds 15&#x000b0;C; that is, &#x02211;(Tm-15) when Tm &#x02265; 15. Originally, it was thought that severe PWD damage would not occur when the MB index is below 40&#x000b0;C months; however, this hypothesis was proven invalid by subsequent prevalence in such areas. The relationship between the level of damage due to PWD and MB index in several areas where PWD has fully spread was therefore re-examined, and a new threshold of 22&#x000b0;C months for the occurrence of severe PWD damage in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>densiflora</italic> forests was set [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As a result, this new MB threshold has been used to successfully explain the range limit of PWD in the affected areas in Japan. Owing to the ease of calculation and the predictive accuracy, the MB index is now regarded as a powerful tool for evaluation of PWD risk, although the differences in susceptibility among <italic>Pinus</italic> species have yet to be considered.</p><p>A dataset of mean monthly temperatures under current and future climate conditions was prepared using the WorldClim dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org">http://www.worldclim.org</ext-link>). For the current MB index, the 30-year mean monthly temperatures between 1960 and 1990 were used, while for future MB indices, a set of 20-year mean monthly temperatures between 2041 and 2060 (hereafter, the 2050s) and 2061 and 2080 (hereafter, the 2070s) was determined by averaging the minimum and maximum temperatures provided by WorldClim. The spatial resolution of the present study was set at 30&#x02033; (approximately 1 km<sup>2</sup> spatial resolution at the equator).</p><p>In the present study, we attempted to compare the differences among four different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and two future time periods. RCPs represent a set of greenhouse gas concentrations and emission pathways [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], a higher RCP representing larger emissions and more rapid global warming. We subsequently calculated eight MB indices for the four different RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For the future MB indices, it is important to consider the uncertainty among the general circulation models (GCMs). We therefore used five GCMs of the World Climate Research Program&#x02019;s (WCRP&#x02019;s) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model dataset, which is available in the WorldClim dataset. The five GCMs were as follows: GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M. Finally, MB indices calculated using the five GCMs were averaged for each RCP and each time period, thereby resulting in eight future MB indices (four for the 2050s and four for the 2070s) prepared for the following analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Evaluation of regions vulnerable to PWD</title><p>According to the isograms of the MB index, areas falling within the natural distributions of susceptible <italic>Pinus</italic> species were classified into the following three risk categories: 1) regions of low vulnerability where the MB index is &#x0003c; 19&#x000b0;C months, 2) moderately vulnerable regions where the MB index is &#x02265; 19&#x000b0;C and &#x0003c; 22&#x000b0;C months, and 3) vulnerable regions where the MB index is &#x02265; 22&#x000b0;C months [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Management measures aimed at preventing PWN infections have been implemented in Japan, South Korea, and mainland China such as felling and fumigation of dead trees in infested forests, strengthening of quarantine measures, and spraying or trunk injection of chemical agents [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

This indicates that the risk of PWD outbreaks in new areas depends on the extent of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to limit the increase in global average temperatures to &#x0003c; 2&#x000b0;C above pre-industrial levels (i.e., RCP 2.6), vulnerable regions will spread further north. However, it should be noted that because the expansion of PWD is affected not only by climate factors, but also by the dispersal capacity of insect vectors, the transportation of infected logs to non-infected regions, and susceptibility of host trees [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the vulnerable regions projected in our study do not necessarily represent realistic expansion of PWD throughout these regions. Nevertheless, the risk of PWD outbreaks in these regions will increase with global climate change.</p><p>Under RCP 2.6, in particular, wide-spread expansion of vulnerable regions was projected in northeastern parts of Asia. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>koraiensis</italic> is distributed in this area, where it forms the principal component of old-growth forests [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>koraiensis</italic> is also one of the major plantation tree species in South Korea, Russia, and mainland China, and is highly valued for its wood products and nuts [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Damage to these forests by PWD would result in a largely modified forest structure, and consequently, forestry industries in these regions would be seriously damaged. On the other hand, in Portugal and Spain, two PWD-affected countries in Europe, almost all <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution areas were categorized as vulnerable to PWD in the future. Increased attention to future PWD risks in these regions is therefore required, even though establishment of PWN has been limited under current climatic conditions.</p><p>Under the highest RCP scenario in which CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations will continue to increase till the year 2200 (RCP 8.5), regions vulnerable to PWD are likely to become wide-spread across Europe and Asia, resulting in serious economic and ecological damage. In northern Europe, the forestry industry is primarily based on native tree species, including <italic>Pinus</italic> species such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nigra</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pinaster</italic>, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Our study suggests that the majority of distribution areas of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>nigra</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pinaster</italic> will become vulnerable to PWD in the future, despite the low risk under current climate conditions. PWD damage of these species would seriously affect the European forestry industry. Moreover, in northwestern Russia, rare old-growth natural forests have been preserved [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> is the primary species of such forests [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. If such forests were infected by PWD, the ecosystem structure of these valuable old-growth forests would be seriously modified. Boreal forests are also primary carbon sinks [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], particularly <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> forests in Siberia and European Russia [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The spread of PWD in these areas would therefore change these forests into carbon sources with the death of large numbers of <italic>Pinus</italic> trees.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Impact of climate change on habitat suitability for <italic>Pinus</italic> species</title><p>The current study also determined the negative effect of climate change on habitat suitability in major <italic>Pinus</italic> distribution areas, particularly in Eastern Europe and Asia (dark brown and yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Climate change is predicted to have a negative impact on forest growth and products in Southern and Eastern Europe via increased drought and disturbance risks, despite some positive effects in Northern and Western Europe [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, in dry European forests where <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> dominates, climate change is expected to accelerate successional replacement of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sylvestris</italic> with slow-growing tree species such as <italic>Picea abies</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the results of these previous studies.</p><p>Under RCP 2.6, almost all boreal <italic>Pinus</italic> forests fell outside the regions vulnerable to PWD in the 2070s. However, estimates of the effect of climate change revealed a decrease in habitat suitability in some areas, probably due to increasing temperatures and aridification. Climate change may therefore result in a decline in these boreal <italic>Pinus</italic> trees, despite the low risk of PWD damage. Moreover, under RCP 8.5, vulnerable habitats for <italic>Pinus</italic> species expanded not only in Europe and North Asia but also in East Asia, approximately 40% of these areas overlapped with the regions deemed vulnerable to PWD. These findings suggest that these regions are at higher risk than other vulnerable regions containing non-vulnerable habitats.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Adaptation to PWD risk with global warming</title><p>Adaptive management is required to limit the spread of PWD and conserve ecosystem functions of <italic>Pinus</italic> forests with climate change. This is necessary not least because even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to the level assumed under RCP 2.6, global warming will continue to progress. We categorized natural distribution areas of susceptible <italic>Pinus</italic> species with climate change into four vulnerability types by integrating the PWD risk and predicted habitat degradation in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The following are adaptation measures for each vulnerability type:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Regions vulnerable to PWD and habitat degradation</p><p specific-use="continuation">Our results suggest that regions of this type, in which the risk of a PWD outbreak is particularly high, are widely distributed in East Europe and Asia under RCP 8.5 (dark brown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In East Europe and North Asia, most of these regions are not adjacent to current PWD-affected regions, and thus, preventing the artificial introduction of PWN is one of the most important adaptation measures. The introduction of PWN into non-native areas is primarily associated with trade and global flow of forest products [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]; thus, it is important to understand the possible pathways of PWN and prevent the import of infected forest products. In <italic>Pinus</italic> plantation forests, logging of pine trees prior to the occurrence of PWD and reforestation of non-<italic>Pinus</italic> species might be valuable in avoiding unexpected PWD spread and conserving forest ecosystems, not least because environmental conditions in these regions may become unsuitable for <italic>Pinus</italic> species due to climate change.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regions vulnerable to PWD</p><p specific-use="continuation">It was predicted that regions of this type are primarily distributed in South Europe and East Asia, overlapping or near to current PWD-infected regions (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Thus, adaptation measures aimed at preventing further spread of PWN, such as logging and fumigation or burning of infected trees [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], are recommended. If, however, PWD spread does occur, programs aimed at reforestation of damaged forests may be necessary. Unlike the regions vulnerable to both PWD and habitat degradation, these regions would not suffer the effects of habitat degradation due to climate change. Thus, in regions where <italic>Pinus</italic> species play an important role in forestry and culture, reforestation of <italic>Pinus</italic> forests might be possible if the total eradication of PWN from the site is successful prior to reforestation. Reforestation using resistant pines, which have been bred in Japan and mainland China [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], may also be effective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regions vulnerable to habitat degradation</p><p specific-use="continuation">In regions of this type (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008">Fig 8</xref>), the PWD risk in the future is relatively low; however, our results predict that climate change will result in deterioration of habitat conditions for <italic>Pinus</italic> species. Although responses of each <italic>Pinus</italic> species to climate change remain uncertain, it has been suggested that drought and warming decrease growth and increase mortality of <italic>Pinus</italic> trees [<xref rid="pone.0182837.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Continuous monitoring of the effects of climate change on <italic>Pinus</italic> populations is therefore recommended, even though it is difficult to distinguish the effects of climate alone and the results of natural succession. Climate change might induce a range shift in some <italic>Pinus</italic> species outside of their current distribution areas.
